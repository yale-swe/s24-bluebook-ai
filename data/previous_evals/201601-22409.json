   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to people with some computational background or engineering background if they are interested in 3d printing for manufacturing. I do think a lot of the material is understood better by engineering students because of the physical models used in the papers. In contrast, the computational aspects are fairly straightforward and easy to understand, but interesting nonetheless.",
    "Perfect!!!",
    "A pretty good course. If you're interested in the material or want to take a less-challenging but still graduate level course I'd reccomend it. A reasonable amount of work, but not bad. Pretty interesting psets, and lots of freedom for the final project.",
    "I would highly recommend CPSC 679 to another student. In this class, I gained a LOT of applicable skills, in the field of programming, scanning, meshing, 3D printing, presenting, and prototyping. I think this class is awesome.",
    "Very good course",
    "This course is an introduction to 3D fabrication. For the first half of the course, we learned about the overall pipeline of a 3D fabrication system and the various algorithms and steps involved in the process. The second half consisted of student presentations of papers from recent conferences. Homework involves coding up these algorithms, and actually scanning and printing 3D models. It also has a quite open-ended project. Working with the 3D printers in the Graphics Lab can be frustrating but the TA and the professor were very helpful. The course gave me a good understanding of the state-of-art 3D printing and how to convert a physical object into a printable digital model, and I would recommend it to anyone with interests in working with 3D printers.",
    "Interesting seminar! A good amount of work, and you get a reasonable survey about all things 3D print related. Of the CS electives, this one is pretty good."

   "comments": [
    "Perfect!!!",
    "This course helped me understand 3D modeling. This course contributed to my dissertation\/research indirectly by challenging me to learn new things quickly (such as C\/C++) to a level where I could apply them. I think that being able to quickly learn new things to a point of application will be very helpful for my dissertation\/research.",
    "The lectures help me a lot"
