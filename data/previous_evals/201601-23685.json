    "Good class but extremely hard. Be prepared to put in hours of work into the Psets, Professor Choi can be extremely demanding.",
    "Difficult psets and finals is 50%. Take it cr d if you don't wanna commit as hard",
    "Highly recommend for students going into finance",
    "Terrific course, great to learn and work at SOM with a professor as engaging and knowledgeable as James Choi. Quizzes were great, as were some of the case-approaches to learning... better integration with the text would've been nice but I really appreciated the introduction to everything James' class instilled, that motivated further reading and exploration. If you're an undergrad econ major looking to learn these things, you can't go wrong taking this class.",
    "The class is great, and wasn't TOO challenging without haven taken Intro to Corporate Finance. Still, it is a hard course - rumored to be one of the hardest at SOM."
