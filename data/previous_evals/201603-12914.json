   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Many of the lecturers tried to cover over 70 slides during the class. These lectures were impossible to follow due to the enormous amount of detail on the slides, the lack of detail actually presented by the lecturer, and the fast pace at which the material was presented. Lectures around 40 slides were overall much better. It is frustrating that there is no feedback on the exams. It is essentially impossible to learn from your mistakes if you are unable to determine what you did wrong. This undermines the the fundamental process of learning. The first unit on receptor kinases and phosphatases is very well developed and cohesive, which made it easier to understand the material. The next two units felt very disjointed. For instance, it was odd to have the first Ca2+ lecture on the 2nd test and the next on the third test. If possible, it would be better if the 2nd unit generally covered one topic (such as metabolic signaling) and the third covered another (such as immune signaling).",
    "The strength of the course lies in the diversity of topics, which provides a decent survey of signaling concepts by experts in the pharmacology department. The key weakness of this course is the lack of feedback. Each exam question is scored out of ten points, allowing for partial credit, but points are deducted without explanation. I received no written feedback on the exam questions that I missed, and I was often confused as to why 2-3 points were deducted. In order for students to correct their errors, I urge the professors to provide some form of feedback for the questions that are incorrect. Alternatively, the professors could provide the teaching fellow with an answer key or rubric for their questions, and the teaching fellow could then explain why a given student's answer did not receive full credit. Without an aspect of feedback in addition to the number score, students are only worried about their exam grades and not about whether they have a good understanding of the material.",
    "weaknesses: the exam questions given by some professors are too broad, not focused on a specific subject discussed during the lecture.",
    "Strength: Just the right amount of information was taught. The lectures fit together well. Serves as a good overview of the research that is conducted by the different faculty members. Weakness: Lecturers should be better prepared as to who has taught what.",
    "I think very well structured course, informative. Good amount of information."

    "I would recommend this course to another students because it is a valuable introduction to many different types of signaling pathways.",
    "I would encourage students interested in understanding signaling as a part of their research to take this course to improve their knowledge of the diversity of signaling mechanisms used by cells.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any pharmacology student or graduate student whose research requires a solid understanding of cellular signaling.",
    "I would recommend this course for students at their second year or higher.",
    "I would. I think this course is a good crash course in signal pathways that provides just the right amount of information. Excellent for grad students in the pharmacology department.",
    "yes, very informative."
