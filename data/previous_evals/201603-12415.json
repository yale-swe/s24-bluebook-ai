   "comments": [
    "Take it with Vivian Irish!!! She will get you through and actually make it interesting for you!",
    "Yeah, it's one of my favourite courses.",
    "Bio 103 will teach you a lot of development. To study for this class make sure you review study guides along with slides. The text reading is not that essential and you can use it as a supplement. Don't be afraid to use piazza for any questions!",
    "Easier than 102.",
    "I would say that overall, BIOL 103 is a fairly balanced course to take. The workload is very manageable and the course material is not too overwhelming at a single point in time. The weekly quizzes and HW assignments (although some people say are too much), are completely doable in my opinion. I would recommend BIOL 103 to another student who has in interest in biology but also to people who are just looking for a (relatively) cool science class. The diseases and disorders we look at in class are really interesting.",
    "This was my favorite module of the intro sequence so far. I almost didn't take the class because I despised 102, but I'm glad I decided to take it. The quizzes were pretty fair and the homework research proposal was pretty interesting. It's a decent amount of work, but one of the more manageable premed classes.",
    "Best module so far. Take it with Irish if you can. Really interesting material, and fair assessments.",
    "This course has a much wider scope than BIOL 101 and 102- so more depth and breadth of material, but much more relevant in the context of human diseases and disorders. The structure of the course (weekly quizzes and homework, Piazza) is much the same as the previous modules, so you'll know what to expect.",
    "BIOL 103 was an overview course of genes and development and associated underlying mechanisms. Its associated section teaches you how to analyze and write a scientific paper.",
    "Bio 103 is a comprehensive look at genes and development; the course material is very interesting however the class moves quickly. The weekly quizzes are difficult but they are worth the preparation because when it comes time for the exam little studying is required.",
    "I don't think there is really any avoiding BIOL 103 if you want to be any kind of biology major. It is a good course, but know how to study correctly as soon as you can.",
    "A slightly more difficult module than 101\/102. This course talks about development and genetics and how these two areas of study are heavily intertwined. This module, like all the BIOL modules, can be tricky if you know outside information about the concepts covered in the course. On weekly quizzes, it can be hard to answer a question concisely because you might know more details, but you need to be aware of the important concepts the course focuses on and to focus your efforts on understanding those central concepts.",
    "I only took this class because it is a pre-med req and and MCDB pre-req. Would not recommend this class otherwise. Just a basic bio class on genetics and devt.",
    "Challenging but very well-taught class.",
    "Not the most engaging or exciting lecture, but definitely one of the better BIOL 101-104 modules. Professor Irish is engaging, passionate, and clear, and the class readings and assignments are interesting. You'll definitely learn new things about developmental biology, and get to read some fascinating papers!",
    "Obviously, I would recommend taking the course if you are a biology major or a premed, but it may not be the best course just to take out of casual interest. A lot of the material is sort of complex, and it's not explained (by instructors, TAs, or even the textbook really) in a comprehensive, bottom up fashion. The emphasis of the course is getting students to the point of being literate enough to sort of follow research in genetics\/developmental biology.",
    "Intro genetics- fairly straightforward, and you'll learn some interesting material!",
    "It's an interesting class -- I enjoyed the subject matter more than the material from Bio 101 or 103 -- and the instructors are committed to making you understand what's going on. Sitting in a lecture hall with 150 other people is no fun, but you can still get a lot of useful information and skills out of the class.",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of work, but if you work hard it will pay off grade wise.",
    "I do recommend Bio 103. It is a nice step further into content and experimentation, and into scientific thinking. The workload gets bad and the quizzes are hard, but you learn a lot from the class. Also, there are many things you have never imagined could happen in nature but they do during development.",
    "It is a difficult, but well-structured course. I would recommend it to other students for this reason.",
    "Biol 103 is interesting, but I'm not sure that I would recommend it to somebody who doesn't need it as a prereq. However, it is a good introduction to developmental biology for those who need it.",
    "Biology 103 is a necessary evil. You will have some review and learn a combination of broad general knowledge and specific facts about both genetics and development.",
    "This course, while not a piece of cake, is very interesting and worth taking.",
    "Biol 103 is a well done course that really teaches you the basics for genetics and developmental biology.",
    "BIOL 103 is a wonderful class if you are intrigued by developmental biology in even the slightest sense. I loved my time in the class, and would recommend it to anyone else looking for a fun, albeit work-intensive, science class to further their knowledge in the biological sciences. I believe that the instruction was great for the most part, the quizzes were fair, and the homework assignments really made you use your head to expand upon and tie together everything we touched on in class! Would rate 4.5\/5!",
    "Bio 103 is a general overview of genetics and development. It is not a very great course, but you likely have to take it. It's just fine.",
    "Best class in the bio sequence, so interesting and well organized. Definitely want to take it with Professor Irish, she is the chair of MCDB and such a fabulous professor.",
    "Moderate workload, confusing homework assignments, interesting course over all",
    "Bio103 will be one of the better intro modules, take 103\/104 sequence if you have an option between the two semesters for your major.",
    "A really good intro genetics module. Really prepares you well to build up to genetics\/upper level bio classes.",
    "Highly recommend, especially if you are interested in topic relating to cancer and related biotechnological therapies. It was an excellent class that helped solidify my decision in being premed. It is most definitely not a gut-- do not take this class unless you are truly interested in biology as a study and would like to go into research or medicine someday.",
    "Biol103 is a course full of amazing concepts and experiments. Oftentimes that concepts were too broad to truly \"know\" rather than be \"familiar with\", but it was still a good compendium of genetics and development. However, this class was heavily concerned with ethics and every student should know that NOT ADDRESSING ETHICS IS AN ETHICAL POSITION. Many of the concepts that we covered had ethical implications, and while I know that this is a course in biology, not ethics, by skipping over the ethics I felt that Professor Irish gave the message \"Science can do anything and society is holding back science\" rather than a message that we have these tools and they have powerful and profound implications on society that we need ethicists, philosophers, religious figures, and businesspeople to weigh in on.",
    "It's the story of how development happens across species. The material is interesting and could tie into other disciplines but is a bit advanced for non-STEM majors.",
    "One of the more interesting bio sequences classes. Teaches interesting topics. Would recommend to those who like development and biology.",
    "Take with Vivian Irish! I have heard horror stories of BIOL 103, but honestly this was the best one in the sequence so far. Quality detailed instruction without too many tangents, long winded and confusing explanations. Stay on your toes about the homework and start before the weekend!",
    "I would recommend BIOL 103 to those interested in development and an introduction to what scientists do in scientific research. Quizzes weren't extremely hard, but the grading curve and a few weirdly graded questions could make it hard to get an A. Papers were interesting and helpful with concepts, but reading the whole paper each week is pretty unnecessary if you understand most figures. The material is well explained in lecture, so I'd pay attention. Textbook is not needed. Final is much like the weekly quizzes. Overall, not a difficult course, but the higher grade distribution makes an A (top 20%) more questionable than in 101 and 102.",
    "Horrendous. They couldn't make it worse if they tried.",
    "yeah, it's way better than 102. 102 is a ton of random memorization but 103 is not like that. 103 is also more \"big picture\" focused than 102.",
    "Vivian Irish is a fantastic lecturer; she inserts just enough humor to keep the class moving, but overall knows exactly what she's saying and has clear lecture slides. The quizzes were, in my opinion, fairer than previous modules; as a side note, I found the Peer Tutor review sessions extremely helpful for studying. There were a few ambiguous questions in the quizzes, but overall everything was quite well spelled out and felt overall quite organized. The homework was a long process of writing a project proposal in the form of a paper, which I found frustrating in the beginning but rewarding by the end. Like the previous two modules, the class isn't much work outside of class and the quizzes keep you on schedule with the material, so it's a very manageable course.",
    "Good class for anyone interested in genetics or developmental bio. The material moves quickly and it helps significantly to have some kind of previous bio exposure (a decent high school bio class is probably good enough). However, even with zero experience one can easily keep up if they're willing to put in a few minutes of studying at night.",
    "Biol 103 is a great class to take for students who are interested in biological development. The depth of the class concentrates on key concepts that help students understand development seen in biology.",
    "103 was fairly enjoyable overall, especially with Dr. Irish--she was adorably excited about things at times, and personable, making the lectures pretty pleasant. Occasionally the material was a little disjointed, but it wasn't detrimental enough to be really noticeable. Overall, a solid course.",
    "Taking 103 with Professor Irish was not a bad class, and from what I understand, is much better than some other instructors. The quizzes were based on what we learned in lecture, and were fair overall. If you need to take this for a requirement, I would do it with Professor Irish if possible.",
    "Bio 103 is one of the more interesting modules in the introductory sequence! You'll learn about things like why certain body parts develop where, genetics basics, and I think after 101\/102, the subjects will be a nice break from more micro-level things like the cell membrane. Professor Irish is a really organized and well-informed lecturer, but as with most of the sequence, it can feel like she's always a bit behind in her lectures. She also sometimes will assume prior knowledge about genetics, so be prepared to feel like you're a bit lost\/moving quickly at times. The sections don't feel like they're that integral to the course either, but some papers are interesting. As usual, you'll have the weekly quizzes\/psets, but this time for psets, you'll be putting together a paper proposal, which is more interesting. Quizzes are harder than in the past though. Overall, I think it's a pretty good class, and one of the best in the sequence. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the class if you aren't a bio major\/pre-med, or someone who is required to take it, though.",
    "I would definitely recommend BIOL103. It was definitely manageable but also pushed us to think about the different developmental processes and presented several interesting concepts and examples.",
    "This is definitely the best bio module of 101-103. The material is interesting, not too difficult to comprehend, and based more on logic and understanding than rote memorization. Also, Professor Irish is amazing! She is great at answering questions and she's a very clear and organized lecturer.",
    "You're probably going to take this no matter what, but yeah, it's a pretty good course.",
    "As most other people will say, take BIOL 103 (and the rest of the intro biol sequence) if you need it as a pre-req for other courses. I liked BIOL 103 than the past two modules (101 & 102) both in terms of content and teaching-style. I really enjoyed Professor Irish as a lecturer.",
    "Bio 103 with professor Irish was better than other modules! Fair class, interesting, and presented well.",
    "I would recommend it because it is a pre-med requirement.",
    "I would recommend as a starting class for developmental biology. As it is often required for many majors, most people must take it and I think that is somewhat okay. I wish I could have taken a class that focused more on depth for certain topics as I felt it jumped around a lot. However, I understand it is an overview of developmental biology and there is too much to learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, personally it was my favorite course of the biology module! The material was interesting, the papers required for reading were helpful in our understanding of the topics, and overall the class was great.",
    "If you have to take 103, take it with Irish! If you actually focus on the homeworks, you'll get a lot more out of the course.",
    "This class is a standard Bio module class, meaning that it is very similar to BIOL 101 and 102, so if those classes were enjoyable for you, or if you find that you are required to complete the year long sequence, then I would recommend BIOL 103, but otherwise there may be better classes for your interests. Overall, the class is a solid class and is well organized, with very little surprises in terms of the setup and grading of the class. One good point for the class is that the grading is very easy and generous, although the weekly quizzes could have some challenging questions sometimes. Since this is the third class in the sequence, the best answer for a student wondering if they should take the class is their past experience with BIOL 101 and 102.",
    "Honestly the most frustrating course in the bio module so far. If you were beginning to be fatigued by Biol 102, get ready because Biol 103 is more of the same, weekly quizzes and all. Quiz averages were higher than other modules, so study hard. They also tended to be more rote memorization than 102 with Horsley, which can be good or bad depending on you. Lectures tended to be unhelpful. Overall take only if you have to. Not the most pleasant experience.",
    "Weekly quizzes encourage you to stay on top of work.",
    "Do it if it's with Vivian Irish. She is a great lecturer and has great slides. The quizzes are challenging but fair. I came in with a bad attitude about the bio modules, but 103 was a pleasant surprise.",
    "BIO103 is back to the old grind. Weekly quizzes. Tedious homework. A lackluster professor. Nobody knows what they are doing. It is a necessary evil for bio majors, so just stick it out. Irish is a moderate professor. Not the best. I would encourage enrichment as it is a wonderful way to get the material presented in a much more coherrent fashion. Also, if you want to have some fun in the lectures, take a shot overtime Professor Irish mentions a Nobel Prize winner. You probably wont make it out of class.",
    "Smart",
    "hard but good",
    "Take this class if it is a prereq for your major, there are probably easier science credits. It's a good class and you learn the basics of development well.",
    "the best of the sequence. savor it",
    "I would recommend the course, especially for students who are interested in STEM majors or medical studies.",
    "I would recommend to someone who really likes bio and is willing to put in a lot of effort",
    "Good class.",
    "Great. Prof Irish was SUPER organized, lectures were clear, quizzes reasonable. Learned a lot. Wish there was more time in section to go over course material. Amount of work adds up with the weekly quizzes and psets however. I liked it more than 101\/2, the homework project that spans several classes was rewarding (but also required a certain amount of BS).",
    "BIOL 103 provides students with a solid foundation of molecular genetics, embryology, and development. It incorporates many of the topics discussed in BIOL 101 and 102, and greatly prepares you for higher level biology courses.",
    "Biol 103 is an introductory course that is a requirement for many courses and it has a similar format to the previous biol modules. Would recommend if it required for your major.",
    "informative",
    "This class is exactly what you would expect. Professor Irish is a good lecturer and the topics are interesting. The workload is manageable and the structure is similar to biol 101\/102.",
    "Section 01 was an enjoyable section. The TA did a good job at explaining the papers and facilitating class discussion, although she sometimes called on the same student to answer questions which resulted in many more quiet students losing the chance to participate more.",
    "Only take it if you need to",
    "I would say that BIOL 103 is a wonderful introductory course to developmental biology. I truly enjoyed this course and would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "Hard work but interesting. Need to prepare for quizzes.",
    "Study of genetics and different phenomenons that occur and lead to changes. I would recommend this course for other students.",
    "I loved this module because I think genetics and development is really interesting; it has been my favorite module so far, so I would highly recommend it. There is so much to learn about and fascinating aspects of development."
