    "One of the strengths is that the schedule and frequency of visiting the property we work on are very flexible. Students can tailor the schedule and focused areas of their field trips based on the traits of their property and their objectives.",
    "The course is extensive in its scope and immensely useful, but the way the material is delivered is not particularly digestible. Without previous courses in dendrology, in particular, I would imagine it would have been very difficult to do well on the exam. The course would be improved by breaking down the material more.",
    "It can feel rushed but I don't know how to avoid that. The course does effectively condense a lot of material into one semester."
