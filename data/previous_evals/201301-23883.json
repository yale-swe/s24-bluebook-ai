I really enjoyed hearing their perspectives.Less student-led, more speakers, please!",
    "it was awesome to learn more about forest certification. i think the course was a bit incorrectly named- it was essentially about cerification and the professor's approach to analyzing the effectiveness of that tool. shorter reading would have been great! i really liked the process of writing and working on the paper. i am not sure the utility of learning such a specific thought process (likely little), but it was interesting!",

    "If Ben could be a bit more responsive to the students, the class would be much better. It was difficult to get in touch with Ben outside of class and we had to reschedule at least a third of our classes due to his travel schedule, which is fine, I understand he had to go to conferences, but it was difficult to have an ongoing class with him absent so often.",
    "Less allowing the same 3 people to dominate the conversations. I would have preferred Ben lead more classes or have outside speakers.",
    "It would have been helpful to have 45 minutes - 1 hour set aside at the beginning of each class for lecture.",
    "no feedback whatsoever on the memos or class organizing. it would be great to bring the CSR discussion out a bit - more broad. itfelt like there were two groups in class - people who got the lingo and people who were new.",
    "I would really like to see more lectures from Prof Cashore - the ones we had were fantastic. While my fellow students did a great job presenting every week, taking a few sessions for the Professor to really go into the basic CSR frameworks would have been useful.",
    "Need for additional lectures and maybe guests speakers who are responsible for CSR practices in firms and multilateral organizations",
    "Course would benefit from smaller class size. Also, more emphasis and time spent on how to present, write empirical policy papers and response papers would be appreciated. These are important skills that are worth taking time to develop from a policy perspective.",
    "The seminar discussions sometimes gasped for air, and it would be helpful to have some more gentle steering on topics and ideas during class.",
    "ensuring that all projects are feasible",
    "The class discussions needed more structure. I think we needed more explanation of concepts and theories before jumping into student-led discussions each week.",
    "The style of the course wasn't helpful--the students were supposed to lead the course--but no one had any idea what they were talking about so I didn't get very much out of the discussions. Many of the students have very applicable work experience but the way the class was run and the focus on theory rather than the application of CSR meant that this wealth of knowledge was barely tapped. I thought that we should have had a lecture component for the first hour or so of class, I wanted to learn from the world expert who was our teacher, instead of just talking with my peers. It was a very frustrating experience overall.",
    "Organization of topics of each class. The way it was now seemed sometimes repetitive and sometimes illogical.",
    "Undoubtedly, the changes in the schedule owing to the other activities of Professor Cashore affected how the course was handled as well as a more in-depth context of the topics under CSR that may have further helped the students appreciate the course."

If I work for an NGO involved in these efforts I am not sure how much I will have to contribute. The one thing that I did find helpful was thinking and learning about problem definition.",
    "My thesis deals with reforestation conducted by multi-stakeholders. These stakeholders involve different sectors attempting to work together and thus how the private sector appreciates working with both government and non-profit affects how effective the reforestation will be pursued. Thus CSR is relevant in appreciating the orientation of corporations."
