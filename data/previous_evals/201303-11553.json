   "comments": [
    "A class on lobsters, fish, and why the government will always fail to effectively protect the environment. If you do none of the reading for the rest of the class, be sure to read all of Ostrom's stuff. You'll need it for the term paper.",
    "much more environmental studies than epe\/poli sci focused. great class if you're interested in common pool resources especially in regards to the New England fishing industry. a little confusing at times in regards to where it's headed, but makes you think for sure.",
    "I recommend this course for students interested in governance and complex issues of policy in terms of collective action problems. It's important to note that this course is about governing institutions and not policy...I'd say that if you're interested in this topic, this course would be highly productive.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in fisheries management.",
    "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in the governance of natural resources or the intersection of science and politics, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d strongly recommend Democracy and Sustainability to you. The first third of this seminar reviews the political theory underlying common-pool resource management, especially Elinor Ostrom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IAD framework. The rest of the course uses this theoretical foundation to examine several case studies, with a special focus on New England fisheries.Prof. Fotos is an outstanding professor who facilitates interesting\u00e2\u0080\u0094and sometimes heated\u00e2\u0080\u0094 discussions about each week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s readings. Although the reading load may seem intimidating, Prof. Fotos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weekly memos will help you direct your attention to the most important parts. He gives you a lot of freedom to choose your own paper topic and is eager to work with you to develop and refine your ideas. Furthermore, this seminar is accessible to students who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t plan to major in political science, particularly those who have a strong background in the physical, environmental, and life sciences. Overall, if you can get excited about the material and find a paper topic that interests you, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll enjoy this class and will gain a new perspective on the environmental problems contemporary society must confront.",
    "Professor Fotos asks the most challenging and pressing questions for environmental politics, and policy making in general. I recommend this class for environmental studies majors, and political science majors with any interest in tackling issues related to governing the commons. You will find your place in the great mix of students that take and contribute to this class! Fotos creates an open and good-humored forum for discussion. The readings are highly diverse in structure, content, and length. Most of them aren't too dense; just some of the social theory and political philosophy themed readings at the beginning of the course. Most of material is manageable for any EVST or PLSC major, no matter the background."
