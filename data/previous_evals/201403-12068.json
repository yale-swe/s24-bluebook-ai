    "Absolutely. THE way to learn Russian if you don't just want to sit around and lean at a snail's pace or goof off. Costya is probably one of the best language teachers IN THE WORLD. This class' workload totally depends on how easily languages come to you. If you're not good at languages, it will literally destroy your life and you should not take it. If you are great at languages, this will be your easiest class. You need to show up to every session to do well, because we go through the material twice as fast as the normal class. Some people had to drop down\/out because they couldn't keep up. But if you think you can handle it, take RUSS 125 and laugh into your 30s as everyone scrambles to learn Russian as the Reds reassume their rightful place on top of the world.",
    "I would describe this class as the proper way to go about learning Russian. The pace is manageable, the instructors are wonderful, and the language itself is completely fascinating. If another student was interested in learning Russian, and was willing to put in the effort to do so, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
