   "comments": [
    "While ITAL 560 provides a nice introduction to the Renaissance, it is much more than just a survey course. Prof. Mazzotta looks at the Renaissance through the motif of enchantment and disenchantment, ultimately arguing that although the Renaissance brought about reduced religious piety, the increased focus on the potential of humankind created a new kind of enchantment. Because of this specific lens, the course is much more engaging than a simple survey course, and I would definitely recommend it to a another student.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the Italian Renaissance and the profound effects it had on Western European thought. It provided a more nuanced view of some of the canonical texts and writers of the Renaissance and encouraged an interesting consideration of the relationship between politics and language.",
    "Absolutely because is a course that opens your mind to a whole change of era and knowledge",
    "Said summarily, by reading core texts of the Renaissance and Baroque eras, as well as texts outside of the Italian peninsula, ITAL 560 will provide you with the opportunity to adequately prepare for your future departmental examinations. It would truly depend on the nature of his\/her character. Professor Mazzotta gives his students a tremendous amount of freedom. His class is fluid, organic, not confined by rigid guidelines. Depending on the type of student, this is either its main strength or its principal weakness. The onus is on the student to derive the most out of the texts and to visit Professor Mazzotta during his office hours..."
