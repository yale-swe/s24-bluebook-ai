    "strengths: We write papers. weaknesses: Everyone needs something different in this process. Feedback was not useful, and was pretty rude to several students. I liked the small group set up, but only because I had a group working on projects somewhat similar to my own. I know some group-mates had very little to offer one another. I think the class would be greatly improved if the faculty members leading it had diverse areas of expertise.",
    "This was a great course. A lot of structure at the beginning, then support throughout the semester. Great model that future instructors can learn from. All the complaints I ever heard boiled down to \"they didn't solve all my problems for me\" or \"they gave me advice I didn't agree with.\" If that's the worst anybody can say, you know you did a great job. The only thing I can think of that could have been better, was that we shouldn't have gone around the room to hear about everybody's project \"real quick\" that one day. It took 75 minutes. Wasn't realistic to think it could take any less. The usual smaller feedback sessions were better."
