   "comments": [
    "This course provided a general overview of life as a PhD student and as a professional in the field. It was extremely useful and provided information as to how journals work, how the peer review process works, how to articulate my work, how to approach difficult situations that may arise in the workplace, and how to manage my time. The exercises were insightful and the end of term project helped me frame my future work. I enjoyed the course thoroughly, and found it a engaging and productive use of my time.",
    "This course provided weekly interaction with speakers from the F&ES Research Seminar series followed by a group discussion on important but overlooked issues in research. These included time management, the peer reviewed publication process and how to manage advisors\/hold effective meetings."

   "comments": [
    "The course was fantastic, Karen has clearly refined the materials and exercises to meet the needs of incoming PhD students. As mentioned above, I learned many new skills and enjoyed spending time with my peers. The only weakness was the structure of time within the class. I would have enjoyed more time with Karen, and less time with the speakers. While they had insightful things to say, mostly, I would have preferred to learn more from Karen. Alternatively, I would have been happy with a three hour class, instead of a two hour class.",
    "The discussions with the speakers were often very engaging and interesting. This is both a strength and a weakness. We were able to ask a number of the presenters questions that I would not imagine being able to ask in many other venues; however, this time often took away from the discussions that followed after the speaker."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a great way to learn about the PhD life and academic careers, and also, hopefully, to build a community of peers.",
    "I would recommend to the program to continue to make this a mandatory course. Not only does it provide camaraderie, and the foundation for future collaborations, with the peers of an incoming cohort, it also gave a space to ask questions and learn the nitty-gritty of the program.",
    "This is a required class for the doctoral program; however, if it were offered as an optional spring course (and my schedule allowed) I would opt-in to more discussions about research ethics, the state of the academy, and challenges faced by research universities."
