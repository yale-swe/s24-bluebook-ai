    "I got to spend time in the field working with foresters, land managers, and loggers.",
    "The most valuable thing I took away from this class was an understanding of the Florida panhandle \/ southern Georgia region from many angles - social, cultural, political, ecological, historical. Getting this kind of case study look at a region is rare and very important.",
    "This was a truly fantastic trip. I think I learned more about forestry in a week on the ground than I had in the entire fall semester. Every day was packed with learning and insights about long-leaf pine ecosystem management and fire ecology in the Southeast, and the ecological, historical, financial and cultural drivers dictating the management of the lands we toured. I'm really glad I took this course and would highly recommend it to any forestry student.",
    "This trip was an incredible experience. I learned about different types of landowners and got to see first hand how their objectives play out in the forest. I learned about prescribed fire. I learned about entire ecosystems and their ecology, not from a textbook or a powerpoint, but from walks in the woods. I got to see how all of the different stakeholders interact and how that affects the ecology. I got to see issues from many different perspectives, not just mentioning what an \"alternative viewpoint\" might look like, but spending hours with people on all sides of an issue. We got to see how paper is made, from living, standing trees to rolls of toilet paper. I gained insight into the south and some of the important issues facing southern culture. I was particularly struck by insight into north vs. south dynamics; this is another example of the value of getting on the ground and learning through local experience. I could keep typing for another hour and still would only scratch the surface.",
    "I gained a really great depth of knowledge about forest harvest and forest management processes in the Southeast. I gained new insights into the interrelationships between different stakeholders in the region. Learned a lot about the ecology and economics of the Southeast forests."

    "Perfect match.",
    "This class met my expectations",
    "Very well -- the trip exceeded my expectations in every regard. I learned a ton and enjoyed it immensely.",
    "The trip absolutely shattered my expectations. I expected this trip to be a fun vacation with some cool excursions. It was, but it was also an incredible journey of personal and professional development.",
    "It was far more stressful than I had expected. However the site visits and discussions with experts were also far more interesting than I had expected. Overall the actual educational content of the trip was fantastic but much of the time I felt I had to struggle to get past the negative aspects of the situation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about Southern forestry in the Red Hills region, one of the world's most productive and financially important timber regions.",
    "The primary strength of this course is the chance to go on a trip like this and meet all of the people who shared their knowledge with us along the way.",
    "The combination of the trip to Tall Timbers and the trip to Boston Place was superb. Those two stops were the highlight of the trip in my opinion. Mike and Charlie were wonderful and knowledge leaders. My one suggestion is to not stay in such a cheap motel in Tallahassee in the future as it felt unsafe.",
    "This entire trip was an incredible experience - I wouldn't change a thing about it.",
    "Weaknesses: The course is open to MF, MSc, and MEM, but the instructor made it clear that he highly favored the MF. By ranking forest operations content and MF students as his true audience, many of the most interdisciplinary aspects of the content were left to students to individually recognize and absorb. The course instructor was extremely overbearing, unpredictable, and played obvious favorites. All students prepared assigned presentations but some were never were given time to actually present (or were cut off in the middle by the instructor). There was no attempt to analyze or synthesize information from the trip. You are really on your own as far as compiling information and drawing larger conclusions based on what you've seen. Strengths: The range of people, places, and ecosystems that were covered in a week were truly spectacular. The support staff Nick Olson and Charlie Faires were wonderful. Our hosts were uniformly wonderful and gracious. We saw some extraordinary places and had real insider views into how things work. The schedule was very full and was excecuted quite well."

   "comments": [
    "take this course ! Do it! It is one of the best forestry-specific classes here.",
    "I think this class is an essential component of the first year MF curriculum. It's so important to learn about forestry in the south, and it was really valuable to start integrating that knowledge with what I had already been learning in previous classes. That being said, it's not only a good class for MFs! One of the best parts was traveling with a group of fellow students who had such diverse interests and getting to know everyone better.",
    "Absolutely take it! This was a truly fantastic trip. I think I learned more about forestry in a week on the ground than I had in the entire fall semester. Every day was packed with learning and insights about long-leaf pine ecosystem management and fire ecology in the Southeast, and the ecological, historical, financial and cultural drivers dictating the management of the lands we toured. I'm really glad I took this course and would highly recommend it to any forestry student.",
    "Don't miss it! This is a chance to immerse yourself in real world situations and engage with the people on the front lines of the forestry industry. You'll have an awesome time, and you'll learn valuable, unique lessons unattainable anywhere else at the school.",
    "This is a great experience and I highly recommend the trip. It is very stressful but also a unique learning experience unlike any other at Yale."
