    "This was a good introduction to general relativity, a fundamental topic in physics that isnt really covered in the undergrad curriculum. It gave me a much better understanding of astronomical phenomena and cosmology.",
    "Black holes, cosmology, perturbation theory and waves",
    "General relatively a little bit",
    "Introduction to General Relativity",
    "Learned a lot about differential geometry, manipulating tensors, varying weird actions...stuff like that.",
    "I leaned how to work with tensors, the basics of differential geometry, connection coefficients, the riemann curvature tensor, Euler Lagrange equations to apply the principle of least action to fields, metrics, how to derive simple metrics (radially symmetric in a vacume, radially symmetric with an electric field from a charged black hole, etc.) I learned about the geodesic equation, conformal mapping, cosmological models of spacetime, inflation, tests of general relativity like gravitational redshift, Shapiro time delay, the anomalous procession Mercury, etc. Then we covered gravitational radiation. I honestly still don't feel like I get the vauge invariance part of the derivation but hopefully grad E&M will help that.",
    "We learned about the mathematics of general relativity, and then used the resulting equations to describe different spacetime metrics. Primarily these were the Schwarzschild and FRW metrics and gravitational radiation."

   "comments": [
    "The course could be improved by spending more time on black hole solutions and other uses of perturbation theory.",
    "I loved the material we covered, though I could've done with fewer \"applications\" and more rigorous theoretical stuff.",
    "This class is awesome because it exposes you to a totally new branch of physics! (and if you, like me, don't take enough math classes, than to new math as well.) Most physics classes build on a set of principles and formalizms that you already know, but the leap of thinking about gravity as geometry is totally different. I feel very empowered by this class to learn more about GR now. I think having the math introduction at the beginning is very useful and well paced. It also helped that psets forced you to continuously practice certain concepts. I think the psets were the right length and the questions were challenging enough to make me push myself and feel very rewarded when I figured them out. Professor Skiba is also a great strength of this course when I took it!",
    "I felt that course was well designed and I learned a great amount. I do not have any negative comments."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "This course was a good introduction to general relativity, a topic which undergrads dont usually get a lot of exposure to. Professor Skiba is great as always!",
    "Yes. GR is very important.",
    "For reference, I'm an undergraduate. I thought that the psets were harder than in most of the undergrad physics classes (e.g. the 440\/441 psets took me ~ 7 hrs, whereas the GR psets took me ~15 hrs). The length of the psets totally depends on the professor. The material was challenging at the beginning because a lot of the differential geometry stuff was new to me, but it got easier as the class went on. So like steep learning curve, but ultimately not that bad.",
    "This class is awesome because it exposes you to a totally new branch of physics! (and if you, like me, don't take enough math classes, than to new math as well.) Most physics classes build on a set of principles and formalizms that you already know, but the leap of thinking about gravity as geometry is totally different and very fun! You will lean how to work with tensors, the basics of differential geometry, connection coefficients, the riemann curvature tensor, Euler Lagrange equations to apply the principle of least action to fields (if you have taken QFT you know this, but it's useful here too) , metrics, how to derive simple metrics (radially symmetric in a vacume, radially symmetric with an electric field from a charged black hole, etc.) You will learn about the geodesic equation, conformal mapping, cosmological models of spacetime, inflation, and gravitational waves. Also tests of general relativity like gravitational redshift, Shapiro time delay, the anomalous procession Mercury, and a really great one with a pulsar system loosing energy to gravitational waves! Skiba does a great job teaching it so if he is still teaching it definitely take it.",
    "If they are willing to put in the effort, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning this very interesting theory.",
    "Yes! GR is rather interesting material, and Skiba is a strong professor. The course isn't super easy but also not super hard."
