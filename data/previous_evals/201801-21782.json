    "Foundations of dealing with QED and QCD.",

    "Path integrals are awesome. Representation theory sucks and I don't get it. Amplitudes and Feynman diagrams get easier to do over time. Quarks and gluons are things that exist and are fairly complicated, but no more than electrons are. Ghost fields exist but also don't? And so do virtual vacuum particles. Unclear why some particles are fundamental and some aren't, but the math seems to not care so it's fine I guess? Also Grassman variables are a thing but unclear why we care. Dimensional regularization is way more fun than cutoffs when you have stuff that blows up, and pretty much everything blows up so that's important. For some reason there are infinite operators that have dimension > d but we ignore most of them. Also minimum subtraction is the default for dimensional regularization even though mathematically it seems like you could subtract more off? Also I learned that I like QFT homework more than is healthy for a grad student who is supposed to be doing research."

   "comments": [
    "I was an auditor for the course, mostly because I didn't feel I could justify spending the time necessary on the homework instead of on research. That being said, I still think I gained a lot from the course; I think that fully engaging with the homework assignments would have allowed me to gain much more, but the time sink they present was just not something I could work into my schedule this semester. However I understand that my two biggest complaints -- the time necessary for the homework and the fast pace of the course -- are just a side-effect of taking QFT; I don't know that Professor Goldberger could do a lot to improve on that due to the nature of the subject.",
    "This class has been very good. It was really helpful that the lecture notes were available before each lecture started.",
    "Everything is great and Goldberger is a perfect human. He's great at answering questions and very approachable in his office. Jingping is pretty great too, but he's super intimidating so hard to ask questions to. We did anyway, because he knows a lot of stuff. The notes should get typed up probably. Maybe next year get all the students in the class to take turns typing up the notes? Homeworks take too long but they're super cool. Maybe cut down the number of problems or the amount of work needed for each problem? I didn't understand the point of learning the details about Grassman variables or representation theory even though both were pretty big parts of the course. Also representation theory made no sense at all. Maybe having an extra set of notes that walk the students through it step-by-step would be helpful. Going from QED to QCD - maybe have a chart of what changes? Because not everything does, and even though QED is a good basis to go off of, a lot of things could do with repeating. But if there's a super reference-able chart that would be helpful too. (In retrospect, I could have made my own. But for next year, you could make one for the students!)"

    "Yes, this is a must take course for those who wish to be theoretical physicists",
    "Yes.",
    "I would preface it by asking if they cared about their free time or anxiety level. If they said no to both then I would absolutely recommend it because (as I said before) Goldberger is a perfect human and an excellent professor. Also the class is super fun even though (or maybe especially because?) it's absurdly difficult. The lectures need to be read like five times to be understandable and the homeworks take much longer than the deadlines allow for because that's how difficult the course is. But like. The material is super cool and if anybody is even vaguely interested they should totally take it because honestly the problem sets for both QFT I and II were the highlight of my week every single week."
