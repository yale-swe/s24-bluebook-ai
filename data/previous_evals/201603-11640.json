   "comments": [
    "This class served as an introduction to sociology and sociological thinking for me. I really enjoyed the coursework and the lectures were straightforward and engaging. I liked how it was team-based learning since people in the class were at different levels.",
    "This course was a great overview of the theory behind social network analysis and provided a good grounding in basic R Studio coding. While the class wasn't a QR designed for coding proficiency, I now know where to go on campus (CSSSI) to work with specialists who can help me apply my intro coding knowledge to build networks for future research.",
    "I learned the basics of social network analysis, I gained some basic skills working with the R computer software, and I developed some insights into how to think about the connections we maintain within society, in a way that I didn't before the class.",
    "Lots of skills in R. About the importance of networks. How to think critically about network analysis.",
    "I had never taken a Sociology course before. This augmented my social science research repertoire and gave me a brief introduction to R.",
    "Analyze social systems in a new way I've never encountered. Learning that social networks can indeed be mathematical, and that certain social ties happen for reasons rather than just coincidence. Learned how to use RStudio!",
    "I learned a great deal of R code, intuition on social networks and their function, and how to collect and analyze basic networks.",
    "Learned about social network theory, research in social networks, and how to analyze a network in R.",
    "LEarned some R, also the basics of social network theory. I also learned some intersting ways to think about networks.",
    "Learned social network analysis methodology. From how to analyze social networks qualitatively, to using Rstudio to analyze networks and create them. Felt like this was a fantastic class because it gave me tangible skills.",
    "This was one of the coolest classes I've ever taken. It teaches incredibly interesting material about social networks, and is truly fascinating.",
    "Very basic understanding of R code. Very basic overview of Social Network Analysis.",
    "A great introductory course! I learned to approach social interactions from a network perspective, and to use R.",
    "Having never taken a class in sociology before, this class taught me a great deal about principles of sociology, especially within the context of social networks, and methods of research and sociological investigation. The final project provided an excellent opportunity to develop a research question and pursue it with self-collected data. I can now comfortably use R studio to perform social network analysis and know how to interpret network diagrams.",
    "Basic understanding of social network analysis and the properties of social networks.",
    "This course was a great introduction to social network analysis and basic R coding. There were incredibly interesting elements of this course. The final project is a great introduction to sociological research.",
    "I learned how to use R statistical package and R studio to map social network data. I also learned the basics of social network analysis, as well as basic sociological concepts.",
    "R! GROUPWORK! SUPER COOL NETWORK THEORY!",
    "I learned what exactly a social network is, how social networks affect our daily lives, and what uses social network analysis has in conducting research into problems as diverse as gang shootings, high school relationships, and widespread company fraud.",
    "I learned how to collect and analyze data using R language. I learned the nature and importance of social networks in everyday life, and how they can be used to predict trends in society. I learned several possibilities that are available through the study of networks.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about social network analysis, which is a subject I had no background on at all prior to the class. Whether it was the start of the class with introductions to R and Studio, just general social network characteristics or the case studies we looked at, all the material was fascinating.",
    "I learnt about the field of social network analysis by way of its theoretical background, various important measures to take into account when looking at a network graph, and how to draw conclusions from certain visual patterns.",
    "This course provided both a theoretical grounding in social network theory, as well as the technical skills needed to evaluate and analyze social networks through R. This course was an eye-opening experience that convinced me of the influence of social networks, as well as their ubiquity in our everyday lives. Very worthwhile.",
    "I learned the basics of Social Networks and they can be applied to sociological research questions.",
    "I learned how to analyze society with a social network perspective, applying methods of social network analysis to explain patterns observed in various social structures.",
    "Learned about how networks affect society and what ways we can use network to better understand social dynamics.",
    "I learned a lot about the importance of social networks in many aspects of life that I would have otherwise underestimated. In addition to specific knowledge on this topic, I also acquired coding skills as well as general data\/stat analysis abilities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked taking this class because of the team-based learning aspect. It was the first class I had taken in this format and I think it fostered a nice class environment. Additionally, it deepened the connections (made stronger networks) of the members in the groups.",
    "The group aspect was a vital element of the learning experience. The instructor managed to pair us up with students with complementary skills- some of us had coding background, some theory, etc. This allowed us to work together, accomplish a lot, and learn from each other. There were no weaknesses to this course. Papachristos is a genius.",
    "Strengths: a good combination of busy work and larger assignments that balances the semester out well. Weaknesses: toward the end of the semester I didn't feel like I was learning concrete knowledge as much as I was in the earlier part of the semester",
    "Overall amazing class. Would've liked more lectures from Papachristos because he is an amazing lecturer. I think we should've had group member evaluations. it seems unfair that one member of our group barely contributed to our final project but she received the same grade as us.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale so far. Team-based learning is effective and engaging, and the lectures we had were phenomenal. Everyone in the class seemed to really enjoy showing up to class to be exposed to new material. Professor Papachristos is an expert and is hilarious. I do wish we had learned a little bit more R since I could basically get by through looking code up in our book and reusing my code from prior assignments.",
    "While this class was one of my favorite class I took at Yale, i wanted more in-class time to work on the group project. Often times, our professor would extend lecture time and because of that, group project time was cut from 15 min to only 5 min, and that was stressful, especially because everyone had to be somewhere after class.",
    "Dr. Papachristos and the TA's are so wonderful. I loved this class.",
    "The group project at the end was a good way to dive deeper into some of the topics mentioned in the class and really showcase what you had learned. Andy is a great professor who is very passionate about the subject. Like any group based class there can be frustrations with the group but it was overall a positive experience.",
    "I very much enjoyed the team set-up. It seemed to work well with the purpose of the course.",
    "Professor, we could have gone much faster and more in depth. We could have gone through each of the properties (homophily, transitivity, etc.) quicker, and certainly we could have spent less class time on projects. I really would have liked to learn more. More rigor. You know a lot, and you have a great eye for what is good and what is not. I could tell that you seemed busy, and I wasn't sure if you were light on our class because you simply have so many responsibilties. Your lectures were always clear, and you are super receptive to questions, especially during the lecture. The project was important for undertanding how to put that sort of study and report together. I think you could have been more creative with the social network of the class in terms of teaching something.We did this the first class or two,=. Also, applying social networks to problem solving could have been one way to test our understanding. Present us an issue and ask groups to conceive of a solution based on papers we have read and our own creativity.",
    "It was a really engaging class and Prof P is a fantastic lecturer. Honestly made the 9am start times (somewhat) bearable. Was great to learn R code, and being able to write my own code and produce a product in R was incredibly satisfying. I think there was some problems with the groups this semester, and there might be more ways to engage groups. I still felt like it was more that work was divided up between group members for our projects, rather than everyone working together on one product. Sometimes assignments on canvas seemed more like busy work, and it might be better to just have a larger assignment or spaced out responses instead of the multiple choice quizzes.",
    "I thought it was taught very well, I wish there was a slightly better\/closer room to the rest of campus.",
    "The concept, that social networks run our lives, is powerful. But the class itself moved too slowly, and we never got very deep into social network analysis.",
    "Strengths- collaborative work made a good classroom environment, individual assignments made sure we read the texts enough to know the main ideas Weaknesses- students' strengths not distributed well among groups, 9am is hard, group work made it easy for some students to do a lot more than others (it would have been nice to have a chance to assess peers)",
    "Prof Papachristos brings greater energy and enthusiasm to the class which helped me stay interested. I wish we had spent more time talking about the studies we read. I enjoyed reading them and the course would have benefited more from this. The group projects at the end were really great. I think the process of executing a group project strengthened this course, however there was too much class time spent on this, or it wasn't properly directed. Typical of group projects, some members cared a lot, some did not. Perhaps a way to grade group members could be considered? One of my group members didn't show up when he was supposed to give our presentation, lied about being in the hospital when skipping class, etc. I found the quizzes to be stressful and prompted me to skim for answers and then stop caring. Maybe having a map of things to pay attention to in each reading would accomplish the same goal? I would like to have spent more time coding and developing those skills.",
    "One of the strengths is the breadth of material covered. I feel confident in analyzing basic social networks. I think that students' experiences differ depending on which group they were a part of--my group was amazing, but I felt that I might have gotten more out of what we were doing if I struggled for the solution more. The reading was a lot, but it was really interesting and enriching stuff.",
    "The organization of the course, from general sociological principles to specific applications of network theory, was great, though I felt like I would have enjoyed spending more time discussing R studio and other types of analyses as well as other properties of networks. For example, the lecture about weak ties was particularly interesting and would have enjoyed more lectures that addressed similar topics of social networks. The group component of the class was a huge success in my opinion.",
    "I wish this class had covered more aspects of how social networks affect real-world behavior. We fell a bit behind on the syllabus and ended up having to skip some of the planned topics. Some of the classes seemed a little repetitive - it would have been nice to spend less time reviewing the readings and more time learning. I wouldn't have minded more lectures.",
    "The course was a broad survey course, it could be improved by narrowing the focus. Social network analysis is awesome and can be applied to a vast array of topics. An in-depth look at specific topics within the research area would have been more interesting for me.",
    "Strengths: material has a good balance of straightforwardness yet also challenging. Lectures are entertaining and insightful. Weaknesses: group based work, particularly in the second half of the semester, leads to people doing less work.",
    "This is a great class, but seems a bit unorganized at times.",
    "Very engaging, just do all the readings because you can definitely get by without doing them but you will learn so much more if you do them!",
    "While I was fine with R as I had used it before, I know other people in the class struggled at times and could have used clearer instruction on exactly how to use R and igraph for assignments. I also wished we'd spread out some of the later sections throughout the course, as I felt most of the really interesting readings came towards the end after we'd slogged through some of the more technical readings, which were important but clustered together towards the beginning. The group project was fine, and I thought that some of the individual assignments had some questions which could be clarified more as they were confusingly worded.",
    "The course was very interesting and relevant. The teaching made it interactive and applicable to life in general. The groups made it easier to learn from other students as well as teaching assistants and the professor .",
    "I really enjoyed the team-based aspect of the class. However, I wish that, towards the end of the class when we were focused on our group projects, we still could have learned more about social network research. I also wish that the individual assessments would have been more explorative, like the first assessment. Reading quizzes were helpful, but I wish there would have been more problem set-type assignments.",
    "I think that the final project was definitely a highlight and that it was really great to see everyone's work and what they came up with. I also thought that the midterm was really effective at bringing back up important knowledge we had studied in the past to serve not only as an assessment, but also a valuable amassment of knowledge for each student. I do however question how effective the short online quizzes were and wish there were slightly more discussion of texts in class----maybe this would be better facilitated by having sections? I found the texts we read super interesting I just felt we didn't really discuss them and its possible that I could have learnt more from that discussion. However, in some ways it was nice to talk about more concrete things in class and have the readings as a larger background that we could apply what we'd discussed to.",
    "The content of the course was stimulating, and the course structure was transparent and straightforward. The final project was an exciting way to see social networks operate real life. Maybe iron out a few of the kinks in a lecture or two, but for the most part was all quite good, especially for the first time being taught.",
    "This course was good for a first run. I think if the schedule of the course is smoothed out it would be better.",
    "The class was a little bit unstructured, and that may turn a few people away. However, I personally liked the loose structure of the course because it allowed for a greater degree of freedom in how one might go about preparing for class and mastering the material. Professor Papachristos put a lot of trust in us to get things done without having to hovering over our backs, which shifted the mindset of \"doing your homework for a grade\" to \"doing your homework to learn something and to not betray Papachristo's trust and lose this great privilege.\"",
    "Strengths: Professor, team based approach Weaknesses: not enough coding instruction for beginners",
    "This is a really excellent course with, in my opinion, no obvious weaknesses or need for improvement."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a great introduction to sociology and addressed really interesting topics in manageable sociological studies. I enjoyed the team-based learning model and found class each week to be engaging and a fun learning space.",
    "The only reason I would rate the course load as \"much less\" is because Papachristos put more emphasis on applying theory and coding than memorizing it. This meant virtually no time spent memorizing facts, figures, or formulas. This was a genius approach, because I was able to do the readings, take notes, and reference back to them when I had to apply a concept or code contained in them. This approach could potentially be taken advantage of by students who are interested in \"coasting by,\" but the readings were so interesting and reasonably apportioned that there's really no reason to have to take shortcuts. Also, the group\/team element of the class was so terrific, because we are paired up with students who have diverse, complementary backgrounds in our teams so that those of us with coding v.s. theory backgrounds can utilize our own skill sets in the team project v.s. struggling to catch up in an unfamiliar area. This means more time spent on project building, collaboration, and theory application.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a thought-provoking and stimulating course that makes you think about things you wouldn't otherwise and that are relevant to everyday society.",
    "Highly highly recommend. Great class and very interesting topic. Papachristos is absolutely fantastic. Definitely the best class I've taken at yale.",
    "I would certainly recommend it, it's my favorite Yale class so far. Professor Papachristos is great and it's fun to be in class each day. Great for me as a non-Sociology but other Social Science major.",
    "Yes! This is one of the few classes at Yale where I was learning the material because I wanted to learn it, not because it was for a grade. I'm also glad that Professor Papachristos made sure that grades weren't an emphasis\/didn't try to make exams or quizzes unreasonably hard. The workload was also doable at all times, and I learned how to look at things from a very different perspective. It's very much worth it!!",
    "Strongly yes.",
    "Yes, Papachristos is great and the material is interesting. It is a good mix of theoretical and applied and you will get the chance to do a final project where you actually analyze a network. The class was pretty easy and could have moved more quickly but I learned stuff regardless.",
    "For now, this class is kind of a gut. The readings are light, the group assessments aren't too difficult, the midterm was manageable and the final paper is doable thanks to the group dynamic.",
    "Good class, but needs more rigor. Papachristos is very receptive, and he's a great professor, but I think the first time around was an experiment to see how this lecture class would go. Definitely a super interesting class, but I wanted to be challenged more.",
    "A great class. Professor Papachristos is an incredible lecturer and keeps you engaged, even at 9am in the morning. You learn how to code in Rstudio with igraph and other methodology relevant to social network analysis. It was great feeling like you could walk away from the class with some concrete skills. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in social networks or doing social science research.",
    "If you want to take a fascinating course with an incredible professor, take this course. If that doesn't interest you, don't take this.",
    "If you want an easy class where you are introduced to social networks very vaguely, go ahead. Otherwise, skip.",
    "Yes, it's a great intro class and you learn a lot of fun things about networks",
    "Absolutely! Especially with Professor Papachristos.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. As a non-sociology major, this course was very engaging and I was able to learn a lot about social networks, a very important and upcoming field, in a profound way. Professor Papachristos makes this class engaging and worthwhile for both sociology and non-sociology majors.",
    "Yes, this is a great course, focussed on hands-on learning! Take this course if you can get in!",
    "Fantastic course where the material can possibly be applied to a lot of different subjects, everyone should take it.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a very interesting subject and has a great professor. It is a good 5th class because there is not too much work, but you learn interesting material. Most of the work is in class as a part of an assigned group, but the groups are designed to have people with different skills and experiences in order to create a diverse working environment.",
    "Great professor, interesting topic, practical skills and not too much work.",
    "Definitely a fun course to take. Social networks have broad applications in many fields, and you read a wide variety of papers which showcase the breadth of these applications, from gang shooting probability to relationship networks to widespread fraud among corporations in the 1950's. A little bit of background in R helps, but isn't necessary, and none of the assignments require anything complicated coding wise. The work wasn't too heavy, and was balanced between readings, individual assignments, and group assessments. The final group project has many of the perks and challenges that accompany any group work, and the TAs were very willing to assist in selecting a topic, refining a research question, and collecting and analyzing the data needed to answer said question. Definitely a solid, fun class.",
    "Yes I would. The course equips students with relevant and applicable insights as to how society is built and how social interactions operate.",
    "Definitely take this course. The material is awesome, and social network analysis is incredible, so if you have no background in it I would definitely recommend taking the class. Prof. Papachristos is awesome, and taking any class with him is worthwhile.",
    "Yes! I think social network analysis is super interesting and just a cool thing to look into. You learn some basic skills that aid you in social network analysis, and get to read some awesome sociological article. Also Papachristos and the TFs were so approachable, available, nice, and helpful!",
    "Would hands down recommend the course to another student, especially one who had never taken a sociology course before. Focusing on networks and relations between things rather than the things themselves is a crucial skill and a valuable tool to be an effective thinker.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a fun, intro sociology class.",
    "This class can benefit any student of any concentration. It's about the society in which we all live in and how we can better identify and explain social norms and patterns.",
    "Yes, APV was a wonderful professor!",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class. The material is so interesting, there's not that much work and Prof. Papachristos is AWESOME. You learn a lot about the importance and impact of social networks in so much of life through fascinating readings and lectures by Prof. Papachristos. There's also a small coding component to this class - as someone who had never coded, I was pretty nervous about this, but the program (R) is really easy to grasp, the TAs are so helpful and I ended up really enjoying this part of the class (plus it's a valuable skill to have). There's also a lot of flexibility and freedom in classwork, as you mostly work in groups, which is particularly nice when it comes to designing a cool and interesting final project that you actually want to do. Basically, take this class. You won't regret it."
