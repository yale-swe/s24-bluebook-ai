    "Don't take this unless you are REALLY REALLY INTO THE UI.",
    "i don't like writting and this seemed like an easy writting class. the lectures were extremely boring as well as the 4 300 word papers. this was all fine until the final 3000 word paper. also grading seems to be low but i have not got my final grade yet.",
    "Course is a bit disorganized-- interesting material, but I wish we had covered more than half of the syllabus in the semester (we only reached the Mac introduction in 1984). The assignments are short and not too much workload overall, but grading is deceptively tough (this is more writing-focused than you'd imagine).",
    "Easy throughout the semester, but hard grader",
    "CPSC 151 gives you an easy workload, but it is very difficult to get good grades.",
    "Yes, if your interested in the computer history as well as writing in a concise way.",
    "This class is essentially David Gelernter rambling intelligently but not very cohesively about a variety of topics loosely tied to the history of the Windows interface from a design perspective. If this sounds interesting to you, take it. I found it interesting just because Gelernter is a smart guy and kind of a character. Don't expect anything too rigorous or life-changing.I didn't do as well as I had hoped because the grade for the class is based entirely on four 300-word and one 3000-word essay. If Gelernter doesn't like your writing style, there's not much you can do.",
