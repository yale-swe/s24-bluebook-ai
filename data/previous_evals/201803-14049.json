    "This course provided an overview of issues regarding language use and social context. The first half of the course was relatively focused on large-scale language ideologies, and the relation between language use and presumed social unity\/difference. The second half of the course focused on linguistic structure and kinds of speech via a classically linguistic anthropological approach. This course helped me unite my understanding of 'language ideology' in the abstract with the more fine-grained study of speech acts and their perceived value."

That said, it is best if you have some research topic in mind in advance, which the readings will then help you to theoretically frame."
