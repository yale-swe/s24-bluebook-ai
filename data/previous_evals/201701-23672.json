    "I am way more fluent in Spanish. My grammar (subjunctive) is much improved.",
    "Spanish speaking, writing, and reading skills",
    "It was a continuation of Spanish.",
    "I developed my overall Spanish skills betaking this course. There was a greater emphasis in L4 on speaking and reading fluently and with fluidity that made Spanish flow better for me. The introduction to literature present in the final few weeks of the course was helpful in that the book was not too long, but it offered a chance to read an actual book in Spanish as opposed to simply reading short stories or text selections.",
    "I thought this course had tests that did not reflect understanding of soanish",
    "I improved my Spanish vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading, speaking and writing abilities",
    "Vocabulary and grammar skills improved and widened; comfort in speaking and reading Spanish heightened",
    "I improved my conversational Spanish and learned advanced grammar.",
    "This course built upon the grammar structures learned in Spanish L3. It was a bit more interactive, which is a plus."

    "VHL Central is a terrible system. Homework cannot be automated. You will be punished by the computer for mistakes for which a human grader would not mark you down.",
    "Poor testing",
    "The course was well organized and I learned a lot. The homework was a little excessive sometimes.",
    "There was a lot of busywork - it wasn't very hard, but it didn't seem to help too much.",
    "The course could go a bit more slowly and explain the readings a bit more. Additionally, the time spent on the movie was slightly unnecessary.",
    "The stories and short films\/movies shown and read in the course were very interesting and led to discussion. I wish there had been more time to develop and discuss the ideas expressed in them. I wish there was more focus in vocabulary in the class itself.",
    "Weakness is in its emphasis in Spanish Grammar; I would have wanted a class more focused on speaking.",
    "I really loved this course. The readings were very well chosen."

    "Yes! You'll learn Spanish. All good.",
    "I learned a lot in this course and I do feel like I have gained some degree of proficiency. It is a fair amount of work at times though.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to someone who is truly invested in developing their Spanish speaking and reading skills. The course is challenging, but the workload is intellectually stimulating and forces you to let go and really work at understanding the language.",
    "If you are looking to improve your Spanish, this course will certainly help you. That and it potentially being a requirement are the only reasons you should take this course, however",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to improve their Spanish.",
    "Span 140 is a decent class, it pretty much picks up where Span 130 left off, but with a little bit of review at the beginning. The workload isn't overwhelming, but there are more evaluations\/graded homework assignments than 130 (along with the same online homework). There are a few oral presentations throughout the class, along with quizzes, exams, essays and homework. They aren't too bad, but are partner projects, so it can be pretty dependent on who you are working with. The quizzes and exams were more essay based than before (the quizzes included a paragraph\/short article that we would have to read and answer a few essay questions about). The essays were also a bit different--rather than writing a story based on given images, we were given actual prompts to discuss using the vocab and grammar that we had learned. Overall the exams\/quizzes\/essays were pretty fair, but there was much more content that could have been tested over (so, more to study) even when it wasn't actually featured in the exam questions. The readings and short films (and the one full length film \"No\") were better this semester, and I personally enjoyed most of them. The historical\/cultural background was also really interesting (some discussions of US interference in South and Central American governments) and the presentations at the end of the semester were a good opportunity to explore more into these topics. Overall, I would recommend the class. Stewart is a good professor; he did a good job of keeping the class pretty laid back and made sure to go over all of the vocab\/grammar\/readings\/films thoroughly to clarify and answer questions. He also has regular office hours and responded pretty quickly to questions by email. He's really nice, and tries to get to know a little bit at least about everyone in the class. He's a native English speaker, which is helpful when you don't know how to say\/ask something in Spanish, but could be a detriment if you are hoping to focus more on your speaking and listening comprehension (mostly if pacing is your issue). Other than that, the only negative is that sometimes I would have liked more feedback about mistakes or ways to improve.",
    "I enjoyed L4 Spanish. This class was a great transition from learning vocabulary and grammar to learning how to express solid ideas."
