   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class. The instructor assigns recent books by academics in many allied disciplines in addition to ethnographic monographs (such as political ecology, geography, gender studies, urban studies, development studies) and is very welcoming of (and is extremely well-read in) different disciplinary perspectives. However, most of the (most vocal) students in the class are usually anthropology graduate students - and depending on who they are, they may or may not welcome, understand, or appreciate a conversation that isn't explicitly anthropological (either in the literature you reference, or the terms you use). In short - if you're not an anthropology graduate student - keep in mind that most anthropology graduate students like to talk in their own 'anthro-speak', which can take a little getting used to. Additionally, they all know each other well already because they take other classes together, so they may have conversations that are continuing on from other classes. But this may or may not be an issue for you, depending on who you are, and who takes the class any given year. Just to reiterate- this is a fabulous class and I highly recommend it if you're interested in South Asia.",
    "yes, a great reading seminar."

    "The course has been invaluable for me to better understand South Asia, and the current academic debates. This is extremely relevant for my doctoral dissertation. Engaging with the weekly readings has also helped me think about how I would write my own academic book."
