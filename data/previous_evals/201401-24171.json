    "Best class I have taken at YSPH. Developed the framework we needed to be able to assess health policies and learn about health systems in other countries. Very relevant subject matter and very clear and easy to understand.",
    "strength: interact lectures with meaningful discussion",
    "This course provides a high-level overview of components of a health system that I did not get in any other course during my MPH. It is interactive, with debates and cases, but the professor also provides key concepts in slides, which is helpful for future reference. I really enjoyed learning the specifics of certain health systems and would have liked to have done even more of this.",
    "Strengths: Very comprehensive while taking an alternative route to understanding the building and development of health systems. Great slides, amazing professor, and helpful and though-provoking readings. Great class discussions and fun trivia!Weaknesses: Not enough trivia",
    "I really enjoyed this course and am happy to hear that it will be taught to all HPM students. There are some really valuable skills to be gleaned about how to evaluate health systems. Some of the frameworks for thinking about the process of evaluating health systems would have been useful for Mark S. 514 course.",
    "The professor was phenomenal.",
    "Chima is great. Should be faster paced course though.",
    "Strengths: It was a great intro to policy and also looked at health systems in a broad and comparative level. The class was always engaging, thought provoking, and fun!",
    "This course was really helpful in presenting an overview of how healthcare systems are structured and organized and what parts are essential and how the different parts interact. This would have been a great class to take in the first semester of the MPH. The readings were interesting; the book was decent and the added readings were good. Dr. Ndumele's lectures were organized and good - he was clear about what the main concepts and points were.However, there was a lot of time in this class that was not efficiently used. Often, only about half of the class time was used in an organized and efficient way. The other half was spent either in very informal discussions or playing trivia, which really didn't seem to be a good use of time.",
    "The strength of the course was it's good structure and the combination of theories with practical tools. It would be good to have more model papers with the comparative research analysis discussed in the class.",
    "Strengths - content. It was great to have an overview of healthcare systems (what they are, how they operate, how they differ by country). This is something that all MPH students should learn but is not currently covered by required classes.Weaknesses - would have loved maybe 1 or 2 more weeks to work on the data assignment."

    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is one of the best professors at YSPH. Very hard to believe this was his first solo course. Makes the material interesting and relevant to what we want to do with our MPH, unlike many other professors. Cares that we are understanding the material and assigns outside work that actually develops the course material.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Great professor! extremely knowledgable and enthusiastic about the topic",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Professor Ndumele was very laid back and treated us as equals. He clearly knew the topic but engaged us each week. I really liked his approach to the course.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima was an incredible instructor. I feel so fortunate to have taken a class with him and he is without a doubt the most engaging and fun professor I have had at YSPH. He is the appropriate amount of serious and silly, and overall very educated on health systems.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0one of my favorite instructors at ysph. really funny and enthusiastic about the subject matter. also very well informed. Very fair when it comes to assigning work and very approachable outside of the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Strengths: Knowledge and enthusiasm. Didn't appear to be his first time teaching a course.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is great.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is one of the best professors I've had at Yale and an incredible lecturer.He is cognizant of his students' time and needs. He is great at keeping the class engaged and constantly thinking. He changes the format of class every now and then to keep things interesting.He also simplifies some of the toughest concepts in health policy and also provides great case based examples.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Professor Ndumele is very knowledgeable. He is also very nice and very approachable. His lectures were organized and clear. He clearly communicated the main points and concepts that he wanted us to learn.However, Professor Ndumele didn't always use class time in an efficient way. Usually, only about half of the class time was used efficiently, the other half was spent in very informal discussions or playing trivia. Professor Ndumele also spent time \"checking-in\" with the class on a regular basis, which really isn't necessary and felt like a waste of time.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0The instructor made the course very engaging and interesting. The combination of lectures, active methods, guest speakers, case-studies, on-line materials and resources was great.I would suggest a little more focus on research, but it might be too hard to do within the introductory course.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima was amazing! I loved his style - having group discussion, case studies, team assignments, debates, etc versus the traditional lecture style. This is the first class I've taken at Yale where I felt like conversations were welcomed and that everyone really contributed to the conversations.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0very caring professor"

    "DEFINITELY recommend.",
    "every first-year students should be required to take this course!",
    "This course provides basic knowledge about health system aims, levers, etc. It is very interactive, using debates and cases as well as a data assignment and project wherein you apply class concepts to a particular health system. I would definitely recommend this course to any student getting their MPH because it is knowledge that helps in understanding the global healthcare environment as well as the US system.",
    "This course will teach you about the fundamentals of building, maintaining, and reforming a healthcare system. It draws comparisons between countries, and looks at some of the means taken to improve national satisfaction.I would recommend this course to anyone because it is so much fun, the assignments are a little challenging (but in a very positive way) and helps to develop an enhanced understanding of our own healthcare system",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for future students.",
    "Good class",
    "BEST COURSE EVER. you will learn more about health policy in his two hour lecture than you will in an entire semester with gusmano.",

    "I would definitely recommend this course as providing good foundation to understandingdifferent health-care systems.",
    "I highly recommend this course and have and will continue to tell other students to take it next year. The assignments were fun to do, useful, and helped improve my understanding of the course work. The lectures were engaging and a great use of class time.There is a ton of learning and material that is extremely useful in understanding healthcare systems in the US and around the world and the information is presented in a clear, concise, and interactive way.This is definitely one of the best classes offered at YSPH."
