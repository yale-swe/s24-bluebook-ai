   "comments": [
    "good",
    "i like the structure of the class that it focuses on the more practical aspects of physiology in public health ( unlike traditional physio courses that just teaches terms and make us memorize everything). I learned a lot and practised scientific writing and study designs.",
    "It is good.",
    "Great course, fantastic teacher. There was an assumption that we already knew the basics of all of the systems that we learned about--I would have liked to have covered more of the basics before delving further into the nitty gritty stuff; I would also have liked to have delved further into the actual chemistry of things too though.",
    "Wonderful public health overview of physiology.",
    "thorough discussion of human physiology",
    "This was a great course. Each week was focused on a different system of the body but connections to previous weeks were always included. It was great that there was not an intense focus on anatomy and specific physiological processes. Important physiological processes were highlighted and those important to public health were discussed in depth. I like that each week we had an overall topic and could choose to write about whatever we wanted to related to that system and public health. It allowed us to explore our interests. I also like that we shared with other people to learn about things we never considered. I also liked the in class problem solving. We got to be creative and practical.",
    "Well, it is necessary for CDE and EHS to take. The info in class is very helpful and useful.I think if its a little bit more organized would be better.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I think that the expectations were made very clear upfront, and we got a really good overview of human physiology as it pertains to public health. The professor tried to give a lot of public health scenarios, and really made an attempt to engage us through in-class work projects. I also liked the write-ups we had every week or two, that required us to look at a specific organ or system and describe a public health problem. I think I learned a lot through this exercise, although there were times when I wish I had had the class lecture prior to the write-up, because I would have had a much greater understanding and perhaps better ideas for pertinent topics. Additionally, if we had been given more guidance on topics to write about it might have facilitated discussion when we broke into groups to talk about our write-ups.",
    "Strengths: well organized, amazing and very invested professor, assignments were perfect amount of workload, structure of class with balanced discussion and lecture was perfect!Weaknesses: the takehome exams felt a little long, but that was just due to the nature of the material-- perhaps having weekly quizzes or more regular testing would break it up?",
    "Interesting content and discussions. Would be helpful if notes were more organized.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! The range of topics discussed was very interesting and well balanced and I felt that the homework write ups did an excellent job of tieing the course topics together. My only critique is that I would have preferred to have more hours of lecture per week. There is so much to cover in a physiology class and I think I would have benefited from going a little more in depth on each system than we had time for with only a little over an hour of lecture a week.",
    "This course was good at integrating basic science concepts with big picture public health issues and practice. Cases were used to make students critically think through these relationships.",
    "This class was well structured, but a weekly essay was a bit excessive and did not help me understand the material more.",
    "My overall assessment is positive. The strength of this course is that it provides a very good overview of the major physiological systems which are essentially to the understanding of other courses and in general health. The structure of the lecture topics allows for each topic to build from one another without being too specific. It was the right amount of information for a 'public health' class; it did not get lost in the details. One way in which the class may be improved is through more critical thinking\/problem solving exercises. While we had an opportunity to work in groups for problem solving activities I would have enjoyed doing more of these types of assignments even as an individual effort.",
    "The course was watered-down physiology. It felt scattered, but I don't think this was due to the professor.I was hoping for an in-depth physiology course, which perhaps should be an elective and year-long course. But I didn't get much out of it because it was too much of an overview."

She is clearly very passionate about this field and wants us to enjoy it as much as she does Her approach to teaching is great because she mixes lecturing with discussion and group work. It really helps to tie everything together and make it fun.",

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel was honestly one of the best professors I've had at YSPH. She clearly is very passionate about the topic and gave some really animated and interesting lectures. I think she also gave really great feedback on our exams and write-ups. As a student who has TA-ed for classes of similar sizes, I know that takes a lot of time but it means a lot, because the students put a lot of time into their work as well.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very caring and considerate instructor! Takes students needs into account, provides very helpful feedback in a timely manner, and an engaging speaker! I had a wonderful time in class thanks to Dr. Yeckel. She is not only brilliant but can actually relate to her students to teach the material in a meaningful way!",

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is very enthusiastic about the material and provides frequent and detailed feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is one of the most enthusiastic professors I have had at Yale. Her great attitude makes the lectures fun and engaging. One area for improvement is that at times the lectures are scattered and jump around a lot from one topic to the next and then back which makes it hard to follow her but this occurred minimally.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very enthusiastic, clearly enjoys physiology, but the material and presentation seemed a bit scattered.Dr. Yeckel clearly put forth a great amount of effort in attempting to cater the class toward individual interests, but I wonder if this detracted from making sure the students really got the \"take-home\" points."

   "comments": [
    "great",
    "a very different physio course that's more relevant to the real worldi will recommend this to another student.",
    "Very good.",
    "Great course-physiology without all of the intense chemistry memorization. It's a much broader overview of physiology, with a focus in public health applications, which was wonderful.",
    "Great class, highly recommend.",
    "This is a great course and I definitely recommend it. It highlights how different aspects of the environment impact the body (single systems and intersystem!) and how this ties into public health.",
    "Great",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone at YSPH in any discipline. I had never taken a human physiology class despite having a biological science background, and I thought this class gave a great overview and was able to keep bringing our discussions back to public health practice. I really think that its hard to study any aspect of public health without understanding basic human physiology; this understanding will certainly help me in my future research projects. The time commitment is not large, but you get enough in class and at-home assignments that you remain engaged throughout the semester without any large pile-ups of work.",
    "This was amazingly well-taught! Dr. Yeckel was very invested in providing helpful feedback to her students and she genuinely cared about our success! The material was fascinating and I learned so much. Would definitely recommend if physiology might be useful in any way in your future!",
    "The material and assignments are very much applied to public health research and practices, so the course can be very helpful when this is relevant to you. For anyone looking for a more fundamental physiology course, this is not it and this is also clearly stated at the start of the course.",
    "This is course that integrates basic physiology as a context for understanding public health issues.",
    "This course provides a very general overall to public health. It is perfect for public health students that want to learn about the major physiological systems (especially for those who have never had an upper level anatomy course). One great thing about the course is that you get the opportunity to do assignments on the different systems that are from which ever angle you are interested in. Creativity is encouraged (something that is not present in other public health classes). For these reasons I would recommend it."
