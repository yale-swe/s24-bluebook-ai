    "At the beginning of my Senior Essay project, the longest paper I had ever written was 15 pages. I was very intimidated to say the least but I was looking forward to challenge myself. The more I learned about my essay topic, the more I realized that my original idea was not quite the direction that I wanted to head into. This was not a disappointment but rather exciting to be making discoveries about my topic along the way. I am generally a bad procrastinator, so taking on a Senior Essay forced me to better manage my time. I was able to cultivate better research and essay organization skills."

    "I was surprised when I discovered that writing a senior essay was not a requirement for the English major. Having taken a senior seminar and then a senior essay, I found that I felt much more accomplished and had further improved my writing skills through the senior essay. In contrast, the senior seminar felt like just another regular english class. Writing a senior essay was a unique experience that I would not have traded. That being said, I almost wish as though the project was a year long rather than semester long pursuit. My essay did involve archival research and I think I would have benefited from extra time."

    "Writing a Senior Essay at Yale is an incredible opportunity. Writing a Senior Essay at Yale in English is an even greater opportunity. The resources at Yale for writing a thesis in English is unparalleled. Advisors are passionate and completely willing to help support you throughout the entire process. If you are even remotely considering writing a thesis instead of taking a second senior seminar, I would definitely recommend writing a thesis. You will feel an sense of accomplishment that will serve as a great addition to your senior year."
