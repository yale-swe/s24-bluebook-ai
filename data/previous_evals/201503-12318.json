    "If you are at all interested in language and how it works, do take this course.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the field of linguistics. I would suggest it to anyone interested in languages, even if they have no plans on majoring in linguistics. Professor Wood is fantastic- he is very knowledgeable on the topics of linguistics we covered, and was very approachable.",
    "If you are interested in linguistics, this intro class is a good option. It doesn't cover everything because linguistics is deep and complicated, but this intro class gives you a good taste of a little bit of linguistics. The materials are super super interesting and very helpful in shaping how you view language. Highly recommended!",
    "Take this class if you want to form a solid foundation in linguistics. Professor Jim Wood is one of the most dedicated professors I have had here, and Jason Zentz, the TA, was equally brilliant.",
    "I took this class just because linguistics was something I wanted to know more about, and I definitely accomplished that. However, pretty much every aspect of the course (lecture, section, homework) is kinda to really boring, except for a few highlights, despite the fact that Jim is a really nice guy who clearly cares about teaching. So if you're willing to go through that for the knowledge, do it. If you can't sit through that, don't.",
    "LING 110 is a great introduction to linguistics! Jim Wood is a wonderful and captivating lecturer, using pop culture references as examples of linguistic phenomena, and making jokes that actually relate to the material (while also getting a good laugh out of you). You'll think about languages, language study, and social issues related to linguistics totally different! Jim Wood is also one of the most culturally sensitive and aware professors I've had at Yale, which definitely added an interesting dynamic to the course. I'd highly recommend taking this course, even if just for your social science distributional requirement. That's what I did, and now I'm highly considering majoring in linguistics!",
    "Intro linguistics is great! This was a survey course, touching on the basics of linguistics, phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. As someone who has no plans to go further with linguistics, I highly recommend it. You should take this course if: 1) you're looking for an easy SO credit (3 one hour tests throughout the semester? weekly homework that takes about an hour? a final that takes 1.5 hours?) AND you think it sounds neat, 2) you're learning another language and want a way to think about pronunciation (hello, IPA), 3) you're interested in language as an idea, and want a framework to talk about different languages, 4) you're kind of an asshole about grammar and wonder if you could somehow be less of an asshole who is still into grammar\/words, 5) you've made fun of one of your friends for her accent\/weird turns of phrase and then felt bad and wondered if you say weird things, and what other weird things are out there, etc. But if you do plan to major in it or do something further, you might want to take something more specific.",
    "This is a good course that provides a comprehensive overview of linguistics. The work is very manageable and both the professor and teaching fellow are helpful and enthusiastic.",
    "Great intro course to linguistics covering multiple subtopics. It was a good class to get a broad overview of what it is like while learning the solid foundation needed for greater study if one wishes. Very detail-heavy and memorization-heavy but Professor Wood definitely puts in a lot of effort into the class to make it as comprehensible as possible. I am not a linguistics major and took the class for fun - it was a LOT of work but I learned a lot about a topic I had no idea about in the beginning of the semester.",
    "LING110 is a great introduction to the field of linguistics, and it really makes you more conscious towards the way that different people speak. Initially it might be a bit overwhelming, because you have to memorise the whole English IPA chart, but be assured that it is an extremely helpful skill to have (just in general, and when learning new languages). A very fun class! Jim is an awesome professor who is really funny and cares deeply about his students. Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course: both students looking to major in linguistics and students looking to fulfill a social science distributional requirement enjoyed this course. At the beginning there is a lot of memorization, but it pays off later in the semester when the approach turns more theoretical. This introductory course is a good way to begin to appreciate the complexity of language.",
    "Having never taken any linguistics classes before, I wasn't quite sure what this class would entail, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. The homework is all very manageable, and the information covered was usually really interesting, and got me to think about language from a new perspective. Jim and Jason both do a great job of explaining everything, and always are available to help. If you have room in your schedule and need a SO credit (or even if you don't need one), definitely take this class!",
    "Take it if you are interested in finding out what linguistics is like. The best thing I got out of this class was that it forced me to learn IPA.",
    "A really great course that provides a brief introduction to major areas of linguistics. I like the way the course is structured: we learn a bit about everything without immersing ourselves in details. The topics captivated me. And Jim and Jason are super inteligent, thorough, competent, helpful, and funny lecturers. The course is not much work, and there are no essays to write, so it is a perfect social sciences course for people who need to satisfy the requirement.",
    "Take this course for what it is: an Introduction to Linguistics. It will not tell you any deep nuances on how accents develop or give you the secrets of creating your own dragon language, but it will give you the basic foundation of how language is formed. Jim Wood is a lot of fun to work with, and the lectures are easy to follow if you pay attention. The midterms are easy as long as you study the material, and the homework is definitely manageable compared to many other courses. Great for CogSci requirement.",
    "Linguistics was an amazing class; fair workload, fair grading, and above all fascinating material. This class teaches you an entirely new field that few have encountered before, and I'm very glad I took it.",
    "This was a basic introduction to a lot of topics in linguistics and if you are at all interested in language, you should take it. It changed the way I think about language and opened me up to whole new areas of interest that I hadn't known about before.",
    "This class is wonderfully interesting but much more difficult than one would anticipate. It is a fun class to take, but I would take it Credit\/D if I had the option again.",
    "It's a survey course of all of the subfeilds of linguistics. I would definitely recommend it to someone even slightly interested in the subject."
