    "The team working aspects were both challenging and fulfilling. The combined expertise of the students, faculty, and guest-lectures helped cover a lot of ground and exposed us to new ways of addressing the challenge.",

    "This course produced a report that will be integral in the decisionmaking process of the City of New Haven with regards to future climate change mitigation and adaptation. The skill of writing such a report was a key outcome to this class. The team teaching component was also useful, in terms of having multiple perspectives from which to assess similar questions."

   "comments": [
    "organization, process improvements",
    "This being the first iteration of the course, it at times felt quite disorganized and lacking concrete structure. In addition, I'm not certain that the topics of focus that were decided on were the best in terms of interacting with city officials in a meaningful way.",
    "The course structure was extremely siloed and confusing, to the point where we did not know who was supposed to do what and who was on which team for what purpose. Guest lectures, while sometimes interesting and useful, could have been replaced with time for us all to do work together, since we already had such disparate schedules. That would have made the process and workflow much smoother. The difficulties in achieving this really discouraged a lot of people towards the end.",
    "I think time could have been saved if we didn't spend as much of the class period debating next steps. A clearer timeline with some room for discussion would be good, but while we were all in class it probably would have been beneficial for everyone to work in teams at least for part of the time. Greater interface with the city would have been helpful too. However, learning how to manage time in large groups and developing a product with minimal supervision were valuable experiences.",
    "The course flow was haphazard. It seemed as is some aspects of the course were being made up on the fly.",
    "Brad could work on improving the manner in which he accords respect to students in the classroom; at times, it could feel as though he was condescending\/patronizing or simply unwilling to engage in conversations that he felt were not integral to the topic at hand. Much of the course was about process -- the process of coordinating 17 peoples' work, the process of collaborative decision making, the process of engaging with a topic that we didn't know much about on a short time scale with little direction. However, process was rarely explicitly discussed or evaluated -- the goals of the process we engaged in were undefined. In addition, control over the process was, at key moments, arbitrarily removed from the class and taken over by (mostly) Brad. Overall, more direction should be given by the teaching team early in the process (decisionmaking by groups of 17 takes far too much class-time); and there should be key reasons to engage in a collaborative decisionmaking process (to \"collaborate\" is not reason enough). More time could be given for students to actually teach what they are learning to each other, so that we don't come out of the class with a myopic perspective on the issues facing the City of New Haven. Of course, this needs to be balanced with developing topical \"expertise\". In my opinion, this report could have been prepared with 8-9 people, rather than 17, if those 8-9 actually took it seriously. Unfortunately, in informal conversations with peers, this course fell to the bottom of most people's priorities. Better structure -- designated and required discussion\/working group sessions, lectures, meetings with the client, etc would help eliminate deprioritization."

    "Very similar to the above comments. Less debate as a class, more group work during the scheduled sessions. Even though some of the guest lectures didn't apply directly to my work it was still useful hearing them and getting exposed to what they work on. I don't plan on being landlocked into just my topic matter, so it was good to see what else was out there."

On the one hand it was good to divide into teams to address different themes, but on the other hand putting us into management vs assessment became very confusing since there was a lot of overlap. Many of us felt that we would just do both concurrently anyway.",

Disadvantages: very time consuming, and often hard to schedule meetings. Some confusion over who was supposed to produce what, and how that effected other peoples' work."

In either case, the ability to get hands-on experience with city officials is a unique opportunity.",
    "This course is a good introduction to applied work in urban areas. It is lacking a bit in structural theory discussions and critical analyses, but does a fantastic job cultivating leadership and expertise in an applied manner. It was also very insightful to work with the city of New Haven, and actually see how government functioned and what was a priority for them. The course presents a wide range of paths and ideas one could pursue, and both the process of knowing there are multiple avenues and being challenged to confront the one we're put in front of was very useful.",
