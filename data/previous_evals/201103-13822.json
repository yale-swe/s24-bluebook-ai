    "English 120 with Strebeigh basically consists of the following:Read about 5 short stories or articles before every class. Then in class, he chooses one or two of the pieces to analyze for various components of writing (establishing significance\/focus\/drama, structure, etc.). Every two weeks, an essay is due on some very broad subject (person, place, personal story, cultural criticism, satire). One class every two weeks is dedicated to analyzing the papers of three students who choose to be \"workshopped\".I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I went in sort of dreading the class (I originally took it simply to fill a writing requirement). I ended up looking forward to every class because the analysis Professor Strebeigh does (or we do with his help) is extremely interesting. It's a different kind of analysis from what I've ever done before--analyzing what the author's intent was while writing the piece and the strategies he\/she used to convey this intent. Professor Strebeigh is also incredibly helpful with writing--his essay corrections are very very thorough, and he gets genuinely excited when people have new analysis to offer. Definitely take it.",
    "If you took any AP English courses at all in high school, you should take English 120. I thought I was a decent writer before, but this class improved my skills significantly. Now, I actively think about what I'm writing, whereas before I just wrote whatever. Fred gives you SO MANY helpful comments on each and every paper, rough draft and final. The Workshop session is also extremely helpful. You have 5 papers to write, total, all nonfiction, but in the end you'llbe so proud you made it through. You'll also want to write well so Fred, such a wonderful man, will be proud of you too. I know when I finally got an A, I was beyond happy. TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "I definitely recommend English 120. This class will take quite a bit of time and dedication but will be worth the time. You will leave the class seeing notable improvements in your writing.",
    "Absolutely amazing class. The type of writing done in this class allows for your personal voice to shine through and the class itself will definitely improve your writing. Strebeigh is incredible. Friends of mine have taken 120 with other professors (Deming, Oppenheimer, etc) and Strebeigh puts more time and detail into reviewing your work than the other professors.",
    "Take this course. Strebeigh is probably the best professor I have ever had. He is great at improving your writing, and he really spends a lot of time reading your drafts and final essays and providing feedback. If you are lucky enough to get into his section, you should rejoice.",
    "A great writing course for anyone who is looking for ways to master their personal style or learn ways to engage readers. All of the skills we learned in the course can be applied to other types of academic or creative writing, so I think it is really worthwhile. You have plenty of time to work on the essays, so the stress level is pretty minimal.",
    "English 120 is a rigorous but fantastic creative non fiction writing course, in which you analyze different pieces of writing for their style, and write your own papers biweekly. I definitely recommend this class if you are willing to put in the time to write good essays. The more you put in, the more you will get out of this class. Taking it will help you become a better writer for the masses, which is an invaluable skill.",
    "Essays are read before class, then analyzed for specific techniques during discussion. Every week an essay is due (rough drafts and final drafts on alternating weeks.) One of your pieces will be workshopped by the group. Expect to spend a lot of time on your writing, but the time results in a definite pay-off. You will end up with a lot of work you're proud of. For anyone interested in writing, this class is wonderful, especially for those interested in exploring more creative styles.",
    "English 120 is definitely a must-take course at Yale. (Obviously, this means that I would recommend the class.) The course offers very interesting insight into different writing styles and encourages students to explore the question of \"if this is what a (humor, portrait, personal, etc.) piece must do, then what must a (humor, portrait, personal, etc.) piece do?\" You read many different pieces in several different writing styles (I believe we covered five or 6), and you end each module by writing an essay in the style you just studied. On top of how inherently great the class is, Professor Strebeigh is also an awesome professor. He is extremely enthusiastic, not to mention insightful and approachable. His comments and edits are always very detailed and well-thought out; it is obvious that he puts in more than his fair share of work into the class and into the development of his students.",
    "English 120 is highly recommended for students with any interest in writing or reading. It combines brisk and engrossing seminars with assignments to read varied and well-written modern essays. Be prepared to work hard in drafting, editing, discussing readings, and preparing comments for classmates' writing. Yet if motivated, you will find the rewards well worth the effort, as you learn an entirely new way to look at magazine articles and learn to implement more effective language in your own writing, for all subjects. Fred Strebeigh's section is superb - fast-paced and inspiring.",
    "Read short stories\/articles from the likes of Swift, Orwell and Wolff, with the rest mostly from the New Yorker. Only discuss one, at most two of the more than 10 assigned readings. Talk about how to structure piece, how to write each sentence, what sentence functions for what purpose, what is the purpose of the piece, how the author uses different techniques to make you like the piece. You understand that writing is not just a stream of consciousness, but a well thought out, continuously edited affair that needs to be interesting to an audience, not just to yourself. 5 essays, rough draft due each friday and final draft due the next, with one extension granted and one to workshop. Very intensive, grading is both based on your effort and the degree to which the teacher believes you succeed at your purpose. Just because you put work into something doesn't mean the teacher will like it. Take it if you want a light reading load but have the time to write, rewrite, and write some more.",
    "A great, great course. You write essentially an essay a week - a first draft one week, then a final draft the next, then another paper's first draft the week after, and so on. A decent amount of work because of all the writing, but it's fun - the essay topics are broad and allow for much creativity, and there's little reading and (thankfully) no final exam. Professor Strebeigh is incredible. I've never had a professor as enthusiastic about teaching as he is, nor have I ever had a professor write a single-spaced page of comments on every one of my papers. His insight about writing in general - not just creative nonfiction - is profoundly useful. You'll become a better writer in any English 120 section, but you'll love doing so with Professor Strebeigh.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120! Taking this class introduced me to a new style of writing and also changed the way I approach reading non-fiction. The draft and revision process in this class is very helpful in improving your writing. This class can be time-consuming, but the essays are fun and interesting and Professor Strebeigh's feedback is amazing."
