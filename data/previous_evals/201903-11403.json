    "I grew to understand Jazz harmony and rhythm much better, particularly how to take difficult changes and work out a simpler method to improvise.",
    "the course assumes a basic knowledge of functional harmony and modes; from there, Professor Escoffery guides you to thinking about the relationship between modes and scales, how they're derived from each other, the bebop scale, and the idea of \"pivoting\" over certain chords",
    "A very basic, introductory knowledge of jazz harmonic\/melodic structures."

   "comments": [
    "Pretty good for what it is - the assignments were geared to keep everyone in the class involved even though there were often too many people in class for everyone to participate.",
    "The course largely allows for your engagement with it to be what you want. I think what was most enjoyable for me as an undergrad was being able to interact with school of music students. I know that I frequently hurt my own learning and Professor Escoffery's teaching by not committing to practicing at the level I should have been. The course definitely motivates you to practice, but I just didn't make it a priority, and i know I would have learned so much more if I did. I think a major strength was the series of guest lecturers we had while Professor Escoffery was in Europe touring for a month! I think it really maintained the engagement of the class and helped me get a lot more from it, and it was just great to meet more musicians and hear their perspective and music. We even had an in class concert which was so great!",
    "Weaknesses: One does not learn to improvise over chord changes by regurgitating the names of scales\/modes to play over a given chord symbol. You have to play the scales, learn figures within those scales, transpose those figures to all 12 keys, and transcribe the solos of great improvisers. We transcribed one solo by John Coltrane that was almost exclusively pentatonic, and its interest is much more in its idiomatic use of the alto saxophone than its navigation of the chord structure of the tune. Its idiosyncrasy for the alto sax made it extremely difficult to play for the other instrumentalists in the room, to little instructive effect. Very few improvisational concepts were learned\/discussed, instead we slowly practiced the 12 bar blues, which is a specific and limited and frankly unexciting introduction to jazz improvisation. Also, there needs to be a lower cap on how many students can participate in this class. 6 pianists should not be able to enroll, because each gets so little time to play in class. Also, so little improvising was done! Very little of what we learned was put into practice."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - great intro to jazz! Maybe not if you have experience",
    "I would recommend it to any performer looking to develop basic jazz chops, but any non-instrumentalist probably wouldn't get much out of the class.",
    "I would not. I sincerely hope that this course is seriously reevaluated by Prof. Escoffery and the music administration, because Yale truly needs a quality course in Jazz concepts and improvisation, but as it stands now I would not recommend it to another student."
