    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think the class very muchallows you to structure your own learning; the supplementary reading for each week allowed you to delve deeper into a topic if you desired. You could really contextualize the information for yourself, and one of the most interesting parts of the class was that this really showed when people spoke.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is a marvelous opportunity to wrestle with the issues surrounding the question of 'popular' versus 'elite' religion.",
    "This course was an examination of popular religion in Europe from the late Middle Ages through the Early Modern period. The course brought into discussion a wide variety of topics, covering intellectual history, social history, art history, and theology, as well as examining the religious practices of the laity. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in any aspect of the subject, as Dr. Eire was willing and ready to allow discussion of topics not included on the syllabus.",
    "\"Popular Religion in Europe\" focused on major popular trends such as Christian materiality, pain, exorcism, witchcraft, relics, and so on. Each week we were given required reading and a list of recommended auxiliary books that helped shape that week's reading and discussion. Each student led one week's discussion with their own chosen material and would summarize scholarly reviews for both their chosen material and the required reading for that week.I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The discussions provided insightful opinions from different people with unique scholarly backgrounds and the selected reading list was excellently chosen by Professor Eire!",
    "The class is reading intensive and engages both historical topics and the work of the major relevant scholars. It is stimulating and capable of inspiring useful work. Even if this is not directly related to one's field of study it at least provides a great model for seminars of this style.",
    "History 579 is an introduction to the problems surrounding popular religion, with the opportunity to observe how other historians have handled the theoretical issues invovled. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "YES I would recommend it. I would summarize it as a seminar focusing on different topics within \"popular\" religion: vampires, miracles, pain, etc. Basically, all the most interesting parts of history.",
    "Yes, because it provides the basis not only for the subject matter of popular religion but also methodological issues raised by that category."

   "comments": [
    "It definitely connected all the aspects of popular religion that were cloudy in my knowledge of the topic. There was one week in particular that refined the topic that I have chosen to work on and it opened up a lot of scholarly material that I did not know about previously.",
    "This course was particularly useful in helping me gain an understanding of the state of the question in the study of medieval and early modern religious culture.",
    "This course was very helpful in seeing the multiple approached available to historians in tackling the question of popular religion.",
    "As mentioned above, it helped me by providing a syllabus of key materials for the topic. Hearing from students of various disciplines was also engaging for my own interdisciplinary work."
