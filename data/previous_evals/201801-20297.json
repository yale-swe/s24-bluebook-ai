    "I learned how to name and side bones.",
    "I learned to identify human bones, and determine age and sex.",
    "This was a well-taught, comprehensive course on human osteology. I enrolled in this course to learn the features of the human skeleton and their function, and I succeeded in doing that.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths is the structure of the course which really allows students to learn best. No weaknesses.",
    "This course is incredibly interesting and helps to explain why the human body is designed the way that it is. The lab structure helps facilitate learning as hands on work with the bones makes learning all of the features much easier.",
    "This is an excellent lab-based course. There really isn't anything I would change about it.",
    "Fantastic class! Learned more osteology than I thought I could take in in a semester. Take it if you can - no regrets, no weaknesses.",
    "I thought this was a very well-organized and excellent course. I thought some of the power-points could have had clearer pictures and arrows. It would be nice if the course could start with a quiz, rather than an exam, so that students could get a better sense of how to learn this material effectively early on.",
    "Great class! Good instructor, good resources, and good class structure.",
    "The open lab format of this class is a great strength, aided of course by the incredible collection we get to study."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another students. It is fun, you learn a lot about the human body and Professor Sargis is great. You never feel intimidated to ask a question.",
    "absolutely, 100%. one of the best taught classes at Yale, largely through hands-on lab activities guided by our Prof.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Interesting flipped classroom, enjoyable course, fun material and full exposure to real specimens.",
    "This course is very interesting and fun and I would definitely recommend taking it if you can get a post. You learn about each of the bones in the body and their important features and muscle attachment sites. The course is fairly low stress and only has two exams and two quizzes, all of which occur before reading week.",
    "Absolutely!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Sargis is great and this class is just so cool. There is a lot of memorization but each class is lab-based, so you just go in and work with the bones and learn at your own pace.",
    "YES!",
    "I would recommend! This course is very different from anything else you will take.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. The class goes by so quickly because it's so much fun. You do have to memorize a lot of things and recognize small features on bones, so it does require work, but it is worth it. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Absolutely! Osteology was such a fun, stress-free, and enjoyable class. Every class session is an open lab where you spend time analyzing bone specimens to learn all the features you need to know for the exams and quizzes. There is very little formal instruction except at the start of the semester and a brief lecture at the start of each unit. It is very much a self-driven class where you learn at your own pace. This was such a cool and unique experience, and a really different class from most of Yale's other offerings."
