    "ENGL 246 is a poetry writing workshop. Each week, every student writes a poem, and Louise chooses three to discuss in class. The poems that aren't discussed in class are returned the following week with Louise's annotations. The class is an excellent way to improve poetry writing skills. Absolutely take this class - Louise is a phenomenal professor and a brilliant writer.",
    "Definitely. Louise is so dedicated to teaching (go in for as many office hours as you can!), and consistently gives thoughtful, perceptive feedback not only on what to change in a poem but new potential directions to take it. My poetry developed so much through both comments from Louise and the lively, productive workshop environment during class.",
    "Definitely take this course. Louise if brutally honest, so if you are very sensitive it might not be the class for you, but if you can take criticism and want to improve your poetry there's really no better way. You write a poem a week, and each week Louise chooses three poems for workshop. Since she does not choose in advance, some people were workshopped 5 times, and others only 2, but she also has weekly office hours, so if you feel like you're not getting enough attention in class you can go in and talk to her one on one. This course is an amazing opportunity with a very exacting teacher. If you're tough enough (and you get in!) take it 100%."
