   "comments": [
    "Take this course with Mme. Sherak! I went into this course having not taken French for quite a while and was absolutely terrified of having to take the language at the L5 level, but those fears were unfounded. You will learn so much in this class and Mme. Sherak will make sure that you learn the material well. Having a teacher who is demanding but also supportive and genuinely cared about the subject is fantastic. If you are unsure of whether to take L5 or L4, take this class and see. My money is that you will learn to love this class and learn a lot of french along the way.",
    "I would recommend this class. The novel we read was really interesting and we had productive discussions in class. It is a very good class if you want to perfectionate your grammar and practice your writing skills in French.",
    "I really liked this class. We read some interesting stories (especially Pi\u00e8ge pour Cendrillon, although I didn't like the way it ended), and we watched some good movies. But this class is a lot of work. Many days there is a lot of reading, which takes quite a while.",
    "Absolutely - it was a great, not too stressful way to advance my French.",
    "This class had a varied approach to teaching french. I love the fact that it was immersion-style. The essays and discussions in class were definitely productive. However, the readings were hit and miss, which had nothing to do with the way they were presented. Across the board, I hear the teachers are harsh graders at the beginning of the term but your grades do improve dramatically by the end, so don't be discouraged! Like any L5 language, there is a great deal of work. Overall though, I feel like I got a lot better at french and that means this class was a success.",
    "French 150 04 is a comprehensive guide to applying all the grammar you've learned so far and using it in speech and writing.",
    "Definitely -- it improves your French from Level IV considerably, and discussions are much more interesting than Level-IV level. Might want to take it Cedit\/D\/fail, because it still is a lot of work, if you don't need it for credit.",
    "I would recommend it only to the student who has a real interest in the language and is willing to put in the work."
