   "comments": [
    "I learned more advanced grammar topics in this course. My abilities to interpret Spanish stories improved as well. I also improved my speaking abilities and fluidity though the help of Profesora Vazquez.",
    "I became much better at speaking and comprehending Spanish. I also learned a variety of ways to express my thoughts and emotions. In addition, I was exposed to a multitude of Spanish literature and was enriched myself with different texts from many authors.",
    "My understanding os Spanish grammar improved significantly through this course and my comfort with speaking also improved. I gained more skill in speaking Spanish and writing grammatically complex sentences. I gained insights into the high expectation by the foreign language department here at Yale, and accordingly will adjust my course load next semester.",
    "I was able to practice grammar on a day to day basis and learned quite a bit of vocabulary.",
    "I greatly improved my oral Spanish skills in this course. The grammar and vocabulary I mostly knew from high school, but learning it a second time was really helpful to get used to practicing speaking the grammar."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus and the course itself are wonderfully organized. I enjoyed having different aspects of learning Spanish (orally, written, etc). The readings were fun and interesting. Class discussions were probably my favorite part of the course, and the small class size made it easy to get to know everyone. It could be improved if the cultural aspects were more relevant to today's world.",
    "it's a required course for many students so there's really not much to say. The curriculum is rather bland and some of the professors are significantly better than others. Shop different sections to ensure your instructor is engaged in the class.",
    "The strengths are how it incorporates students in everyday classes. However, it was a bit static at times and could be more different. It felt like a routine because lots of the exercises we did were very similar.",
    "This course's strength and weakness is its course structure: meeting daily. It makes sense for a language to meet daily as that maximizes exposure to the material to help retention; however it works negatively against us stem kids who have many classes that run concurrently with the limited available times for Spanish classes. For example, all of the spanish sections next semester run sometime between 9 am to 12:30 pm. But I am forced to take the earliest course because I have a bio class from 10-11:30am. Moreover, it wouldn't even be feasible for me to ask for a later section time because this class meets everyday and labs run once a week from 1-5pm. Forcing me to take the morning class is keeping me from taking a marketing class that runs at the same time in the morning. So, more available sections or longer classes that meet less frequently would be nice to have as an option.",
    "There should be more opportunities to speak in a natural, organic manner. Perhaps pen pals from Spanish speaking countries would help.",
    "This course has a very fair workload and the environment is fun because you get to know the people in your class very well. The class offered a lot of variety day to day and a lot of opportunity to improve oral skills. Supersite was annoying sometimes but helped a lot with learning the basic grammar and vocabulary."

    "This is a wonderful intermediate course! The Spanish department at Yale is absolutely fantastic. Class discussions were always entertaining, and the syllabus is very organized. Profesora Vazquez wanted every student to learn Spanish, and she was so helpful and kind!",
    "I recommend shopping various sections to find an instructor you like. Obviously if you need to take this class you will take it.",
    "Yes definitely because it would help them sharpen their Spanish speaking skills and help them become a more confident Spanish speaker.",
    "Yes, learning a foreign language ought to be a mandate for every student. And, because Yale's language department is so strong it makes no sense for a student to not explore new languages and that holds true for Spanish.",
    "This course is a great way to practice grammar and vocab. However, it is a lot of work and Professor Vazquez's grading is brutal, and sometimes rather arbitrary so there isn't much you can do to boost your grade.",
    "The Spanish department is very strong at Yale and will definitely prepare you for SPEAKING Spanish well!"
