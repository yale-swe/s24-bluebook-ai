    "It is a fun class, and I enjoyed the class and lab overall; however, it is quite a bit of work, especially for a freshman. If one is planning on taking it, make sure to take into account that every week you will have homework for lab in addition to hw for the class, which often were due in the same day or sunday night and monday morning in class. It's a fun class and the work is fun, but it definitely took up a lot of my time during the semester, especially for the labs. The final project and labs throughout take a lot of time on the weekends and throughout the week in order to meet deadlines.",
    "YES! Even if someone was not planning on going into mechanical engineering, I would suggest that they try to get into the class for the wonderful experiences that it provides.",
    "A good course overall. This course is deceptively work intensive, though Dollar will warn you at the beginning of the course. Not mentioned in the description, but there will be a 3hour lab at night every week. It's the lab that generally is more useful as you get to do hands-on designing and fabrication rather than the theoretical \"It should work\" of lecture.",
    "Don't be fooled. You are going to be spending many hours in lab conquering what seems like a simple project. You will slave yourself taking three times the amount of time you thought you would need to fix the problems with your design. You will become extremely frustrated when things don't work. You will probably question your sanity and your existence. And when the dust clears, if you really enjoy design and manufacturing, you will feel very rewarded. Class is not too difficult if you learn how to apply certain equations to certain problems, and if you pay attention in lecture. Lab is a grueling and trying test of your patience. Only take it if you're seriously considering MechE as a major, and this class will (probably) answer that question for you.",
    "Excellent design and intro class for MENG. If you are still wavering on deciding to do mechanical or not, this is the class for you because it gives a great overview of the major but isn't inaccessible, even if you aren't too far along in pre-reqs. This class is mainly for freshmen and sophomores. I already was committed to MENG when I took this course but still thoroughly enjoyed it. It is also pretty fun and you get to do shop work and solidworks design. Dollar is a great lecturer and the TA's are good. Fair warning this includes a 3 hour weekly lab along with the 2- 50 minute lectures and about 6 psets. So a pset about every week and a half. There is a final project that will also take up at least half of your reading week. I thought it was still worth it but if you have, say, 4 other hard classes with exams or long papers, I would think about it really hard before taking this course. It isn't hard, but it is time-consuming.",
    "This is a pretty good course if you want hands on knowledge and experience. The labs are very time intensive, but I found them very fun. It can be really frustrating at times, and it definitely sucks away your time. The labs went from 7-10pm this year, so be prepared for that.",
    "185 is a very straightforward class, if you do the work you'll do well. The problem sets prepare you for the exams. Unfortunately, lectures does not always prepare you for the problem sets and you have to do a lot of research\/figuring things out for yourself. the labs are enjoyable and the final project is a lot of fun if you don't do the whole project the week that it's due.",
    "If you know anything about mechanical design or cars, this would probably be a pretty cool class for you. Compared to other mechanical engineering classes, the coursework and assignments are not terribly hard. Except, THE FINAL PROJECT WILL CONSUME YOUR LIFE. The last month of class into reading period you work on a project where you have to build a remote control car. Cool right? WRONG. I spent days in the lab without sleep working on this car and in the end it didn't even work. His project will eat up all your time, because there are so many problems you won't realize you have until you start putting it together. But other than this project, it's a pretty chill class. The workload is not that heavy and the material is not that conceptually hard. But Yuri, the TA who grades has a heavy hand and is very specific with test\/problem sets. If you're a freshman or sophomore still thinking about mechanical engineering I'd definitely recommend this course otherwise, do yourself a favor and save yourself a head ache.",
    "MENG 185 is a great course to take if one is interested in Mechanical Engineering or something similar. The P-sets tended to take me longer than some in other STEM classes I have taken, but I think it was worth it.",
    "Dollar isn't a good professor - isn't responsive to emails and doesn't really help students. Funny guy though and great to chat with. One TA was really strict on gradin while the lab TA was great. A ton of work and final project takes up a lot of time. Learned a lot about how things are made though.",
    "This is really a lab course. The lectures are bland and straightforward and the psets are really tough, but the majority of your grade is the lab section, which is tons of fun. Granted, it's a lot of work and can be a little frustrated when things don't work, but it's super rewarding to complete the projects. Two of the three labs are group projects, so be ready to work with at least one other person on pretty high-stakes contests. If you want to be MechE though, this is a must-take. Really helped solidify what the major is all about.",
    "Kind of a mixed bag. Seems casual and taught a bit like a joke but then the PSETs hit you. Overall a meh. Do not take if you don't have to.",
    "A solid course that will require a lot of your time. The final project is a monster and can be a little disgruntling at times. You will have to do a lot of work to do well as this course has both a lecture and a lab component. The midterms seemed to be quite difficult and the labs were weekly in the evenings. It is a good class to take if you are interested in design but will require tons of time and effort.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to freshmen who are trying to decide if they want to do MechE or sophomores who are deciding what track of MechE they want to do. This class is an average amount of work - a weekly p-set that takes up ~a few hours\/week, a couple of midterms, and a weekly lab either Tues or Wed. night. The labs are a lot more hands on while the class theoretical. However BE WARNED the final project will make or break your experience in this class. Some groups worked really well together and were able to get it done really quickly. But for others esp. if your group members are duds then you will spend your entire reading week and finals period in the lab. The entire thing. More hours in there than anywhere else.",
    "Good class with cool content. The final project is a pain, and will take a lot of time so plan accordingly. Ahsan is a savage of a TA, and will be super helpful.",
    "I was undecided on ME major (and still am) and took this course to help figure things out. It's a lot of work (especially at the end); don't fool yourself into thinking it isn't. The lab portion has some fun projects but requires a lot of time put in outside of class. I liked the class as an intro to ME but found that it's a real time suck. The last project is extremely satisfying to complete. Be prepared to work in groups."
