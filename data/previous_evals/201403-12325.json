   "comments": [
    "A very difficult but very rewarding seminar--I highly recommend trying it. Professor Horan is incredibly knowledgeable, and makes you think in deep analytical ways helpful for any number of other courses. The class is more theoretical than you would expect; it focuses a lot on the assumptions and frameworks that underlie urban politics. Writing the papers for this class was one of the most challenging assignments Ive had at Yale, but Prof. Horan was more than happy to guide me through it and read drafts and outlines. If you can stand being a bit intimidated and doing fairly involved weekly reading responses, this is absolutely a class to take if you have any interest either in cities or more generally in the discipline of political science.",
    "I highly recommend this course to all interested in public policy as it blends political theory and policy applications in an engaging way. Professor Horan's is demanding, but that enhances the overall experience. It's a great class and one well worth taking.",
    "This course explores different ideas about how individuals and institutions gain -- and use -- power in cities, as well as what the ramifications are for residents (especially poor minority residents). The readings examine cities as political, social, and economic entities. Taken together, the readings and discussions that are a part of this course provide a very comprehensive look at the \"messiness\" of problems facing city leaders and city residents. I VERY HIGHLY recommend this class for anyone who has an interest in working in cities... or even for people who don't! In conversations I've had with classmates in the course, I think we all agree that our perspective on city dynamics has been fundamentally altered as a result of this class. I feel as though I have a better understanding of just how complex and entrenched problems are in cities... and how the deck is often stacked against the poor and against African Americans in particular. All in all, this class has genuinely enriched my life.",
    "A word of caution: this class, while intellectually interesting, is very difficult. Be prepared for a ton of reading, difficult reading responses, a midterm (10-15 pgs.) and a final (15 -20 pgs.) If you're interested in a good foundation in urban policy or are interested in poverty, social policy, inequality etc., you should take this class -- though I might recommend Prof. Horan's spring class on poverty if you're interested in more practical and less theoretical political science. Overall, Professor Horan is hands down one of the best professors in the Political Science department -- she really really cares about her students and their work in the way a ton of other professors do not. However, that doesn't stop her from having extremely high expectations. I would definitely take the option to write a research paper with her for this class (which I did) over writing the two prompts she gives -- it's honestly the easier and more rewarding choice.",
    "A great class for anyone who is interested in learning about urban issues. The material is tough and Professor Horan expects a lot from you, but no prior background is assumed. There is a lot of reading, weekly response papers, and tough midterm\/final papers, and she expects you to make good contributions to class discussions (she will push you on anything unsupported), but the result of all of this is that you end up with a great understanding of the material. Take this class understanding that it is a challenge, but also very rewarding.",
    "A hard but extremely worthwhile class. Grading is tough but fair. There's not much reading, but you have to read carefully. The syllabus says there will be two 10 page papers, but they're really 12-15 pages. This may go without saying, but only take this class if you are interested in city politics! You will earn a new-found respect for urban policymakers and gain an in depth understanding of how cities work.",
    "Yes, provides a theoretical framework for looking at cities and their problems.",
    "This is a great chance to think about cities and urban politics in a structured, rigorous way that is likely to challenge whatever previous assumptions you might have had. Professor Horan is an excellent discussion leader, and the weekly reading responses and pair of seminars you will have to lead with classmates assure that you'll have a very intimate knowledge of the material. The class can be hard to get a seat in but is well worth it if so.",
    "Difficult but rewarding. Professor Horan is an incredible professor and the topics you cover are pertinent to politics at this day and age",
    "Definitely a challenging course. About half of the course is spent on theory, so be aware of that. Writing the essays (two 10-12 page papers, one due in the middle of the semester) was the most I have struggled with essay writing. There are also weekly reading comments (1 - 2 pages). I don't know if the class fully lived up to my expectations. But don't shy away if you're interested in the subject - I would say the experience is probably worth it."
