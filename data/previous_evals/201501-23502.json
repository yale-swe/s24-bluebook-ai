   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. take it. Best Econ seminar I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take it. I walk away with a vast amount of knowledge and understanding of the US financial system, from its foundation to the 2008 financial crisis.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student and I hope they will learn as much as I did from Professor Hilt.",
    "Wonderful course. Probably best Econ course I've taken at Yale. Professor Hilt is a great teacher who has structured the course with a great deal of thought. Welcome respite from other theoretically heavy Econ courses.",
    "Definitely take this class. You should know everything taught in this class to understand how our country works today, and even though there's a final and it's a seminar if you have actually done the reading it will be a piece of cake. The group paper is really interesting - really getting you to look at primary financial sources and doing something with them - all he cares about is that you try and get something out of this - a really refreshing course and I wish there were more like it at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this seminar if you are an Econ major. The structure is super clear and the material is really interesting. A good overview of the creation and evolution of the financial system. Only a group project and 10 pg paper(done by group), a midterm and a final...the readings are manageable and important though. Professor Hilt makes it interesting and provides understandable explanations and clarifications!",
    "ECON 451 is a great course -- the material is interesting and the readings don't take that long. The classes were a good mix of lecture from the professor and discussion of the readings. I also liked how the readings were \"guided\" in the sense that the professor gave us specific questions to think about. The work was really manageable; there was one midterm, a group project (presentation + 10 page paper), and a final.",
    "Yes!! Great Econ seminar."
