   "comments": [
    "This course is a fantastic, unique overview of the history of democracy in the Western world. In this course I was exposed to a wide range of readings and thinkers the Professor Cammack was able to weave into one cohesive course.",
    "I developed my ability to track the (exceptionally) long history of democracy.",
    "I can confidently grapple with selected works by Polybius, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Constant, Mill, Schumpeter, Pateman, Wolin, Locke, Wollstonecraft, and others. I can also draw conclusions about the progression of democracy from the ancient period into the modern.",
    "Broad but very insightful overview of the key tensions and movements in the evolution of democracy as a political ideal and politics system from 5th century Athens to modern politics. This is the first time Ive taken a political science course so it was also very interesting to learn how to write polsci papers and engage in class discussion on politics!",
    "This course is fantastic! A great survey course of the history of democratic thought, and one that really challenged my understanding and conception of democracy as a political tool.",
    "A better understanding of the various theories and understandings of democracy, from the linguistic roots to the modern interpretations.",
    "Incredible overview and introduction into political history.",
    "Greater understanding of ancient texts in both Greece and Rome. Good overview of political philosophers from the middle ages until now.",
    "We learned about the different forms of, and different ways of thinking about, democracy over time. We read texts from multiple influential philosophers and theorists throughout the ages. We developed skills in analysing each text carefully and critically, and how to compare them to each other."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of the weeks towards the end of the semester in particular felt a bit rushed, but overall there is nothing that I would improve.",
    "Professor Cammack could have spent more time with how democracy changes in the middle ages so as to better clarify the transition from ancient to early modern democracy. How do people like Bodin and Hobbes relate to their medieval counterparts? Were they reading Marsilius of Padua?",
    "No weaknesses! Well-prepared lectures, well-appointee readings.",
    "Towards the end of the course, the readings were fairly dense and normal end of semester fatigue had set in, so students were not as engaged with the material as they were at the beginning of the class. But otherwise, it was a very well balanced and rigorous class.",
    "Solid all around. Great amount of reading, engaging lectures, professor is awesome.",
    "I liked the scope of the course, but I felt that it got a bit less focused towards the end. While the early sections had a clear historical and theoretical focus, after the French Revolution or so it felt like this lessened.",
    "Unrealistic loads of reading, difficult but rewarding papers, wonderful instructor and discussions.",
    "Strengths - very extensive overview of democracy through the ages from the Ancient times to modern. Interesting texts and scholars. Weaknesses - sometimes would have been nice to spend more than one class studying some of the philosophers we read, at times felt as if we skipped over some important information.",
    "It would have been nice if all of the readings had been posted online at the beginning of the semester; it was sometimes easy to fall behind on readings because they had only been distributed two days prior.",
    "Overall I think this was a very strong course. The weekly readings were dense but appropriate, and very interesting and applicable. The main strengths of this course were its professor, Daniela Cammack, and its chronological structure."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It felt as if it was a really great lecture with a cohesive argument, but spread out over the entire semester. Professor Cammack strikes a perfect balance between covering the necessary historical facts while also incorporating her own fascinating interpretations into the course.",
    "Yes, I would! Professor Cammack has a remarkable ability of making the history of political thought accessible to all students.",
    "100%.",
    "Yes. Its a well structured, well taught survey course that clearly articulates its purpose and executes on it over the course of a semester.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. This gives a pretty good introduction to political history, in addition to lots of modern theories of democracy.",
    "Yes, definitely. You will emerge with knowledge of the foundations of democracy. You will also have invigorating discussions of political theory that are understandable for an introductory level political science student.",
    "Absolutely! This class is basically a crash course in political philosophy. It's great for people who may not have taken Directed Studies but are still interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student that is interested democracy, even only remotely. It teaches about democracy and the history surrounding it, and how it applies to democracy today. It is a highly engaging course!"
