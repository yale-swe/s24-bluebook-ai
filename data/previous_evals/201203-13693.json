I learned to balance work throughout the week, and it was useful to have a critiqued output at the end of every week.11. The instructor was quick to respond to any student questions or concerns, and gave thoughtful feedback. This was one of the strengths of the course for me.",

   "comments": [
    "The weekly readings were incredibly informative and applicable to our discussions. The homework assignments not only taught us the skill of taking massive quantities of information and synthesizing, but also ensured that everyone came to class having not only done the reading, but also having spent serious time thinking about the key messages of each article.",
    "Students in this course quickly developed a grasp of the primary literature while developing important analytical and writing skills. I left the class feeling confident in my ability to engage with other academics on the topics and write a clear, concise policy brief that I would feel comfortable giving to government officials or non-profit leaders. The format of the course provided a comfortable atmosphere where students from different academic backgrounds could discuss topics from the weekly readings and come to their own conclusions.",
    "The class had an innovative format that allowed for the development of critical reading and writing skills. The mix of assignment types allowed for a good dissection of the material. Topic was fresh and we were able to get a lot from the Professor's deep engagement in the issue.",
    "The discussions and the reading.",
    "A) Course provided very thorough exposure to peer-reviewed literature on climate change and urbanization. B). it was clear that the main take-away from the class was a very specific and useful skill: writing a synthesis. C). Karen gave really interesting insight into IPCC and other international research groups on urbanization\/global change. D). Peer review of S&A's via Dropbox worked really well. The process definitely gave more incentive to improve writing, and its quite helpful to read\/critique others' writing style and synthesis skills. E). Due to the reading and writing intensity of the course, the students who decided to take the course were all very interested, engaged, and committed to the topic. Several students mentioned a unique camaraderie \/ bonding experience :).",
    "Karen created a challenging course that was effective in teaching the skill of synthesis, while also exposing the class to a large body of knowledge.",
    "The class discussions and \"elevator pitch\" presentations. Every class was great!! The almost intimate nature of the class also built bonds between the students.",
    "Karen's a wonderful and insightful teacher, and the course was challenging and informative. She is the best source for urbanization trends at FES, and her syllabus is a wonderful reading list.",
    "learning to get a good hold of a body of reading and discuss it in a useful context"

   "comments": [
    "I think overall the course was very good. A possible opportunity would be in expanding the oral assignment. Rather than saving the \"pitch\" presentations until the end of the semester, it would be useful and instructive to scatter them throughout the semester (ie. 2 pitches per week? a \"pitch\" session for each policy memo due date?) or have more than one pitch due- one in the beginning and one at the end.",
    "I found group policy memo review sessions to be very useful throughout the course. This type of peer review and critique should be encouraged outside of the classroom as well as within.",
    "A bit too much time spent on how to write the synthesis in the beginning few classes. Also, a lot of time spend on the administrative set up of the IPCC, whereas perhaps a website with the org structure would help answer those basic questions and allow us to get to the more meaty topics.Would be great to incorporate a field trip to an ongoing conference or government meeting on this topic to ground the academic literature.",
    "It would have been nice to go on a field trip with the course, for example, to Doha.",
    "None, it was a wonderful class.",
    "Some of the readings were extremely specific (ex. emissions of concrete and green roof installations) and although they could be interesting, they made for a tedious read.",
    "I honestly can't think of any.",
    "view more models of good S&A's would help, maybe have a class to dissect one and really learn the structure after knowing the reading for that paper."
