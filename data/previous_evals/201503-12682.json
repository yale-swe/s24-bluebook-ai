   "comments": [
    "Very very interesting course material and class discussion. Reading load is very heavy, and writing weekly written response to the readings is demanding too. But I feel that I learned so much from this course, and Professor Rosenbluth is very nice and willing to help too.",
    "YES",
    "Take it if you're ready to grapple with some theoretical texts that you may initially fail to see the application of, and if you're ready to be humbled by meeting some truly brighter minds (PhD student & Prof. Rosenbluth).",
    "An interesting course particularly for econ\/poli sci double majors. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a class that is heavier on reading and lighter on writing. Professor Rosenbluth is very knowledgeable and cares a lot about her students.",
    "I highly recommend this class to a motivated undergraduate. The readings are pretty difficult some weeks, but the responses force you to sift through everything and find the heart of what each author is saying. There will probably be more grad students than undergrads in the course, but don't be intimidated. You can hold your own as long as you read carefully and think through the readings before you show up to class.",
    "Yes. This class gives a great crash course in the various intersections between politics and econ. You don't need a strong econ background however there is a lot of terminology so I would suggest at least a couple political science or history classes before signing up. Its a lot of reading but very worth it. It was one of the first classes to give me an understanding of political science as a discipline rather than just a lump of classes."
