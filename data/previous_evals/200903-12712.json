    "Yes, I feel that the placement of the class in the first semester is very beneficial as students can immediately begin to apply the lessons of precedents of architectural histroy information to other classes and research.",
    "yes",
    "This course was placed in a perfect spot. What a great way to start out a Yale!",
    "Right where it should be.",
    "As as class that allowed one to engage on one's own terms through the reduced workload and relaxed attendance policy, this class was able to engage learning on a level it most likely wouldn't have if a more rigid organization were pursued. Here, in the context of the very high work load of first semester, this class was one of the few places where I could relax and contemplate architectural history without the stress of exams or periodic testing. This was an invaluable class for me because of this.",
    "Yes. It's a great survey course for the first year M.Arch students.",
    "This course was not a requirement for me.",
    "Yes, the course occured in the proper sequence. It was a good introductory course to the history of modern architecture.",
    "Yes, I think that the first semester is the most appropriate time for this course.",
    "Yes.",
    "Necessary for an introductory modern architecture course to be at the beginning of first year.",
    "this course was incredible.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "absolutely. It was a great counterpoint to Formal Analysis and always seemed to provide interesting parallels with what was going on in my other coursework.",
    "Yes, the course occurred in proper sequence. It was a nice continuation of the summer session history course.",
    "Great.",
    "Yes, this was an overall great course and a important place to start our academic career at yale.",
    "Yes.",
    "This course occurred in proper sequence.",
    "Yes, I was very glad to have this history course this semester. I only wish I hadn't been so exhausted from other classes and could have stayed awake during lectures more often.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "It seems to occur in proper sequence with the program, but it is unfortunate that more time (that ends up going to studio or structures) cannot be devoted to it.",
    "yes",
    "The course is adequately sequenced within the curriculum of the Architecture school.",
    "Yes, in its proper place.",
    "This class was a great overview of modern architecture history and was a good introduction to the Yale School at Architecture. It established a common language of base precedents for the class to use in the years to come.",
    "Yes",
    "I think that the course occurred in the proper place in the curriculum.",

   "comments": [
    "I think having a syllabus given out at the beginning of the semester would have been extremely helpful. The subject matter of each class as a delightful surprise, but a surprise none the less. Also I was a little shocked that there were no assigned readings for class. This would have been helpful as well.",
    "wonderful helpful informative.",
    "It all worked and made sense.",
    "Clear sequence, interesting material presented in a way that kept me alert and engaged. Heavy on class hours and light on assignments (one paper) which was a very welcome change from other classes. If you wanted to learn the information, you went to class and easily did as it was presented in such an interesting way. I also appreciate the due date of the paper (right after thanksgiving) as I could concentrate solely on it for a time.",
    "The content of the course was excellent, covering a broad range of topics relating to the history of modern architecture. Professor Forster\u0092s lectures were uniformly excellent and interesting, often focusing on lesser-known architects or unique interpretations of famous work. Although most of the content was familiar to me prior to the course, it was presented in a way that made it highly interesting. The organization of the class was a little bit weaker- there was not a very strong sequence to the lectures, and at times it felt like topics skipped around and were somewhat random. The assigned course book was out of print and very difficult for many people to get a hold of. The discussion sections were not very helpful overall, and often contained very little discussion. While reading assignments were mentioned at the beginning of the class in relation to the discussion section, readings were never assigned\/distributed. If short readings were included as a requirement for the sections, it might lead to more discussion. The term paper assignment, however, was excellent in its open-endedness and I enjoyed researching and writing it.",
    "My only issue with the course was that the paper was the only requirement. I really got a lot out of going to lectures and discussions every week, but because there was not a formal requirement I think a number of my classmates missed out on a lot. I think there needs to be more incentive to attend class.",
    "Very good survey of modern architecture. I like the opportunity to do additional research through the end-of-term paper.",
    "I enjoyed the organization of this class. The lectures were very interesting.I appreciate the effort in encouraging our own interests in the open topic paper. The decision to have the paper due after Thanksgiving is also a very wise one.",
    "I thought it all to be very appropriate.",
    "The sequence was smooth and logical. While I was so thankful for the light assignments, I wish more of the overall curriculum were devoted to this class over others. The material was exciting, thought provoking, and could be easily related to what we were learning in studio, but there were no assignments besides the paper that pushed students to delve deeper. This would not be possible unless one of the other courses were given less importance.",
    "I appreciated the in depth focus on a small number of subjects.",
    "Lectures were fantastic and memorable. Professor Forster is a master at conveying architectural experience in a vivid and engaging way. I especially appreciated how many of the lectures delved into narratives that could easily be marginalized in a modern history course (e.g. Asplund, Plecnik, etc.).",
    "Wonderfully done. This was my favorite class besides studio. I loved the way Kurt presented the material. Don't change a thing.",
    "I think the whole course was well organized, with a lot of interesting information. Considering that there was only one final paper at the end of the course, it is hard to comment on the assignment question.",
    "The course provided an overview of the history of modern architecture. There was a strong emphasis on the biographies of the designers.",
    "I loved all of the lectures--I learned something new every time, despite having taken similar architectural history classes already.",
    "Everything was very good.",
    "The lectures covered an appropriate breadth of the Modern movement in some detail, choosing to focus on the individual personalities and buildings which were either definitive or aberrant within the canon.",
    "The material covered was well prepared and presented. The sequence worked well. The syllabus and paper were initially confusing and could use a little more clarity.",
    "Great material. It\u0092s hard to fault Kurt.",
    "I really enjoyed the material presented and really appreciated Professor Forster\u0092s perspective. I had previously taken a few architecture history courses that discussed the same material, but I feel that Professor Forster presented it differently."

   "comments": [
    "I was just expecting another typical history class, but the passion and knowledge of Forster and Sherer for a subject matter that can often be dry and tedious was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed and learned something from every lecture I attended.",
    "Fabulous course! Exceeded any expectations!",
    "My expectation were beyond met. I expected to learn a little about history and I ended up learning a lot about history from the greatest historian\/lecturer of all time.",
    "Expectations: Clear and interesting presentation of history of modern architecture to fill in the gap I had in that precise area before the class.Met: Yes, definitely. Met and exceeded.",
    "Having taken several prior courses in the history of modern architecture, my expectations for the course were not particularly high. It exceeded my expectations in the high quality of the lectures and the diversity of content covered. The discussion section did not meet expectations, as it added nothing of value to my understanding of the course content.",
    "Coming from an Art History background, I had quite a bit of experience with a letcure-with-slides type of course and found that this exceeded my expectations.",
    "Expected to learn about modern architecture, and that happened. The lectures were excellent.",
    "I think the class was much lower pressure than I had expected.",
    "Expected to learn about Modern Architecture History and the key figures, buildings, moments etc.. and I believe I did. Expectations were well met.",
    "I was expecting a quick and broad view of modern architecture, like several courses I've taken in the past. Prof. Forester exceeded my expectations by skipping certain topics and noteworthy architects in order to spend a class or two looking in depth at something specific which he seemed to personally enjoy. His anecdotes, enthusiasm and ability to make seamless connections across disciplines made the class very unique, exciting and really made the material come alive.",
    "The course exceeded my expectations. The material was always presented in an engaging and inspiring way.",
    "I expected to develop a critical understanding of the narrative(s) of modern architecture. Expectations were met and exceeded.",
    "Perfectly executed. I never was too interested in architectural history until this class. It makes so much more sense now. Kurt did a great job of exploring history in an incredibly applicable way to today's discourse. Wonderful.",
    "Professor Forester presented many familiar buildings in an interesting was with a unique historical perspective.",
    "The course met all my expectations. The lectures were always informative, very well presented, and fun. The small group meetings were interactive; the body of knowledge that Mr. Forster posses is truly impressive and an inspiration on its own.",
    "I expected to be taught about the important buildings of the modernist period. I was pleasantly surprised that we learned as much about the designers' personal lives as we did about the buildings themselves.",
    "This was a much easier course than I expected, since the only real assignment was the final paper, but I don't think anyone in the class could have handled any more work. It was appropriately tailored to a first-semesterschedule.",
    "I expected a traditional history class. What I received was even better, with both basic architectural history covered but also an \"inside\" look into architectural history I never knew existed. Wonderful.",
    "I only wish that I had been able to devote more time to the course, as it was very well presented and very important material.",
    "As with any history course, I expected to garner a richer understanding of the events which gave shape to our current milieu. I am grateful to Mr. Forster for the extensive architectural genealogy discussed throughout the course.",
    "I had no real expectations so that wasn't really an issue. It was a pleasent course next to the other architecture history courses I have taken.",
    "This class exceeded many of my expectations. Kurt Forster did a wonderful job painting a history that was vivid and interesting.",
    "Having been prepared for another conventional, that is comprehensive survey of modern architecture, I was elated to learn that Kurt would break a strict chronological structure, as well individual building focus. Instead focusing on larger movements and agendas through detailed presentations of individual or groups of architects.",
    "I was expecting the course to be a rehash of what I had already learned in previous courses, but I was surprised because while the material was the same, it was presented in a different way."

    "I have a better understanding of architectural history both in term of breadth and depth of subject matters. I also liked the secondary focus of famous architects as actual people. These little asides and anecdotes were delightful and gave added insight into these creative giants.",
    "informative.",
    "This course was my favorite of the semester. I could attend Kurt's lectures for the rest of my time at Yale. I hope there is another history class that is for 2nd and 3rd years that he is teaching.",
    "How can you put a value of learning from one of the greatest historian\/lecturers of all time? Simply invaluable.",
    "I found this course to be invaluable as a place of reflection. In an intense atmosphere of production in our other classes, this class operated for me as a time to re-engage intellectually with the historical context of my architectural education. It allowed me to step outside of my other classwork and take a broader perspective of my efforts at school.",
    "It is an extremely valuable course for us all. It's an absolute treat to attend Professor Forster's lectures. He is amazingly knowledgeable in his field of expertise, astonishingly well organized and clear about his presentation. We all enjoy listening to him so much, and wish we never had fallen asleep because we were allexhausted from the studio work...",
    "As above, I will mention that this course has strengthened a weaker point in my education, namely history of MODERN architecture. I found it to be very valuable and actually used what I learned here in all of my other classes at one point or another this semester.",
    "This course was valuable in giving me new insights into many familiar topics of modern architecture. I was also happy to see attention paid to architects whose work is often excluded or skipped over in survey courses, in particular Gunnar Asplund, Joze Plecnik, and Eliel Saarinen.",
    "I was really enjoyed this class and always left with new ideas for my studio projects. I don't think that one could ask much more than thatout of this course.",
    "I think it is important to know these things.",
    "Having not had a very good history and theory background, it was a friendly and interesting starter course.",
    "Kurt Forster is possibly the best thing to happen to the first year program.",
    "It was valuable in giving us an overview of the different players in Modern Architecture, their works and intentions\/Project(s).",
    "Very. I wish I could take it again. I often found his observations resonating in my head while designing, and often had the desire to look deeper into subjects he mentioned.",
    "my favorite course of the semester!",
    "I loved it. Iwould like another semester of it. Or two or three!",
    "Very valuable",
    "I believe that the information presented in the class is valuable to any architecture student. Even after taking several of art and architecture history classes previously, I learned new things and acquired new perspective on some of the subjects that were discussed in class. So in this sense, this course was very valuable to me.",
    "I appreciated the biographical emphasis of the course. This fresh approach made the experience more enjoyable. The other material was a little repetitive, as I already hold an architecture degree and have completed several modern architecture courses.",
    "Very informative, well-presented, engaging material that was both helpful and inspiring for studio and our other classes. This was probably my favorite class.",
    "This course was incredible. In talking to old friends at other schools, the things we learned and the buildings\/architects we studiedthey have not even heard of.",
    "loved it.",
    "Commonly in architecture, one is asked if they have 'seen' a certain building - that is, whether they are familiar with a work, and to what extent. This is typically a very difficult matter, since simply being aware of the existence of a project (being able to recognize its image, perhaps) is much different than actually *knowing* it. To understand not just the general form or arrangement of a building, but also its precedents, technologies, issues, etc., is a task which often takes a lifetime. For me, this course represents a small, albeit significant step in comprehending the vast corpus of architecture on a meaningful level.",
    "Low value. For the most part, if I want to know something about an architect, I look it up on the spot. History courses make for nice stories, sadly. The world on instant research makes a course like this less potient.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "This course served as a refresher to many of my undergraduate history courses while adding new information and back-stories.",
    "Valuable and one of a kind.",
    "I think that having Professor Forster\u0092s perspective on the history of Modern Architecture was extremely stimulating.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. This class is my personal favorite next to studio. When I am clear-headed in class, I feel so enthusiastic about architecture. History no longer feels like a collection of facts, it truly comes alive in Professor Forster\u0092s class. I find myself constantly sketching and jotting down ideas relevant to my studio work. The endless inspirations I derived from his class were critical to my intellectual growth as a designer. Participating in his class felt like watching a great movie, which one just wants to watch over and over again to catch all the brilliant details that make the plot profoundly beautiful. I think what worked so well with this course lies with Professor Forster\u0092s passion for his subject and his convincing belief in that history is not pass\u00e9, but incredibly relevant to today."

    "Forster is a great teacher.",
    "Forster - Extremely knowledgeable and personable. Every word that he said during the semester was a gem. His lectures were extremely well composed, highly informative, and thoroughly enjoyable.Sherer - Very knowledgeable, but he dominates the discussion section. I found myself unable to get a word edgewise. He also has a bad habit of interrupting people in the middle of expressing a thought. I know he means well and is eager to impart knowledge to his students, but he just has to ease up a bit and let the students talk more.",
    "You can't get any more effective.",
    "Kurt Forster is a tremendous asset to this school and I am truly thankful for the opportunity to have learned from him both in lecture and discussion.",
    "We had a TA for this class?",
    "Professor Forster's wit and humor made the class stay tuned in, and the discussion in small groups reinforced what he taught in class.",
    "Professor Forster was excellent in all respects. His lectures were original, engaging, and diverse. He showed great knowledge on all topics presented, and was also particularly effective at introducing humor and personal anecdotes into the lectures. I would hope to take further classes with him in the future.Professor Sherer had extensive knowledge of the subject, and many interesting ideas and viewpoints, but was not a very effective discussion leader. He would often present a series of ideas or questions that ended up turning into more of a lecture than a discussion. Sometimes it felt like he was so anxious to get his own points across that he would not listen to what others were saying. In discussion, he would focus on small details and the wording of people\u0092s responses, rather than the larger discussion points. This was not very conducive to creating an atmosphere of discussion. Perhaps if the discussions were given more structure, like short assigned readings, he would have been more effective.",
    "As stated above, I thought that Kurt was very effective.",
    "It is nice to listen to Kurt Forster talk. He always teaches us such interesting things.",
    "Professor Forster is very engaging and well-learned on the subject. His lectures are a pleasure to listen to.Discussion rarely occurs during discussion sections, as Professor Shearer tends to overpower the conversation with interjections.",
    "Kurt Forster was amazing.",
    "Forster was very effective and direct in his methods - not hesitating to give his opinions or views.Sherer on the other hand could have been more effective had he presented his own opinions too. I don't think it was a confidence issue but a teaching style issue and if the student is curious and asks then one would expect a more direct answer.",
    "The discussions were not as valuable as the classes because discussion seemed completely aimless, yet students did not get a chance to open their mouths. Sherer did not seem interested in what anyone had to contribute.",
    "Discussions sessions were rarely discussions. Dan Scherer would overwhelm the conversation by introducing too many topics in a very verbose fashion. I often felt that when I tried to make a comment, Dan would perceive it as a personal critique or he would completely disregard the question.",
    "Kurt Forster was engaging and inspiring. Lectures hada good balance between factual information and critical interpretation. Discussion sections with Prof. Forster were equally engaging, although the format was more like an extension of lecture rather than a forum for discussion.",
    "Great.Sherer seemed to talk in circles and evade questions a lot in the discussion sections, but overall he was very knowledgeable and informative. He provided interesting viewpoints.",
    "As I mentioned previously, Mr. Forster is a truly inspiring teacher whose knowledge and enthusiasm far exceeded my expectations of the course. His narrations during the class were very effective in conveying and presenting the information of the class.",
    "The weekly discussion sections were interesting. Sometimes they veered away from the information presented in the lectures, but I always learned something.",
    "I thought Prof. Forster was great. No complaints or suggestions for improvement. Prof. Forster--please be sure to check your faculty mailbox as the first-years have left a gift there for you!Prof. Sherer was my section leader. Although he is very knowledgeable and well-read, it was impossible to have a focused discussion with him for the one hour duration of the section. Too often he would pose a topic for the class which would only serve as a starting point for a rambling series of questions and digressions, so that by the end of class, we (mostly he) would not have spent any time talking about the original point and would not have learned anything related to the current week's lecture. He was also poorly organized, giving students incorrect due dates for the only two assignments of the semester.",
    "Everyone involved was fantastic. Forster was wonderful, and Sherer was an enjoyable second-look at what was discussed in lecture.",
    "loved the course. Kurt's ability to draw you into the subject is highly commendable.",
    "Please see response to \"Question 8.\"",
    "Professor Forster is arguably one of the best speakers I have had the pleasure of listening to.",
    "Kurt Forster was one of the best history professors I have ever had. His lecturers were clear, interesting, well prepared, and personal. He was able to make a lecture to fifty students feel like a small group conversation. Daniel Sherer\u0092s discussion sessions were also well prepared and interesting but were more lecture-like. I had trouble relating to many of the references that were over my head and stifled conversation.",
    "Having had both Kurt and Dan for the hour sessions, I feel that they could be improved. The lectures are strong, but its harder for the students to participate in the hour discussion. Perhaps if there were some complementary readings the sessions could be more useful.",
    "I thought that Professor Forster was a very stimulating lecturer and I also thought that Professor Shearer\u0092s section was interesting.",
    "Professor Sherer is very knowledgeable of the subjects and very well spoken in discussion meetings. I wish that he would give students more opportunity to talk and complete their ideas before providing his own insights."

    "Why is the entire assessment dependent on a single paper?? One poor paper seriously compromises your chance of success in this class.More than one assessment task would be better.",
    "Please provide a syllabus at the beginning of the semester.",
    "We need more time to actually do more intensive reading for this course.The gruelling requirements of the design sequence took up all our time.And so I felt we did not get as much out of Kurt \/ Daniel S as we could have.",
    "Have Kurt teach more required courses!",
    "This is obviously a standard question on a form because no one would seriously ask this question in real life. You can't improve perfection.",
    "The only thing that may improve this course is to demand some sort of discussion between the students-- this was encouraged in the discussion, but it was usually an individual student questioning Professor Forster or having a discussion with him, not with another student. Otherwise I thought the course was very interesting and engaging.",
    "Overall, the course was excellent and should remain mostly intact, with the exception of the discussion sections. These should be reworked to allow for more actual discussion to take place (see other responses).",
    "Again, I touched on this above, but I think there needs to be a greater incentive to attend lectures and discussion sections.",
    "Having videotaped lectures available on the classes server would allow us to revisit the lectures along with the images, which would be very valuable.",
    "Weekly short readings perhaps relating the lectures to actual published material(s).",
    "Short, bi-weekly papers instead of discussion.",
    "My only suggestion would be to find a way to encourage greater attendance. It is clear that Prof. Forster's lecture are livelier and more engaging when he is lecturing to a full class.",
    "None, it's excellent how it is. Maybe warm the temperature in Hastings if anything.",
    "None.",
    "Make this course optional for students who hold architecture degrees.",
    "I think Prof. Sherer and Prof. Forster, if they are to work together again, need to coordinate better, or find a highly-organized TA who can email the entire class and give everyone the same information so that it is not a guessing game for the students when it comes to requirements and deadlines. Otherwise, the lectures were wonderful and I wouldn't change them, except to say that I really enjoyed the ones that discussed more contemporary architects, because it is really interesting to see how these people figure into a longer history of 20th century architecture--and I would've liked to see more contemporary subjects.",
    "I do not have any suggestions.",
    "While both Mr. Forster and Mr. Sherer are no doubt thoroughly knowledgeable historians, I found that the lectures and discussion sections often left me with a collection of scattered ideas and vignettes, like a Sunday drive or a magnifying glass over an ant hill. Certainly there is no 'good' way to introduce a body of ideas so cross-referential that any beginning is also a middle. However, I would suggest that for a given lecture, there be a clearly stated thesis - a relevant, notable heading which the topics of discussion work to corroborate. Perhaps that would be a somewhat disingenuous presentation of 'history,' but since we are already trusting [two]interpretations of events, I think it would be a much more useful construct in retaining and understanding the material.",
    "It is great. Perhaps enforce attendance harder - it is too easy to skip a class in this course, and the course is too important to skip.",
    "Kurt Forster just needs to keep up the fantastic work. The only improvement I can think of is coffee at the door to help keep people awake.",
    "At the moment the lectures are great. The sessions need improving. We are given lectures, which is where we should be forming our questions, but there requires more gestation of information. Through readings, we would be better suited for responses in the hour sessions \u0096 more time to think about what we are learning that at the lecture.Also, placing this class on the same day as studio is asking for it to be skipped."
