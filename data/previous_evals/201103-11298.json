    "I was under the impression that this class would be more integrative of policy AND science but as a science person, I felt that it was all policy and not catered in a way to interest or involve science people in the policy process. Overall a dull class.",
    "Course is very useful in that through readings and lectures it gives you a broad understanding of what \"planning\" really is at a professional level.",
    "Nowhere in the class description did it say that this course would have such a strong legal\/regulatory bias. The class was very one-sided. Too many of the guest speakers came from the legal field, or from Pace Law directly. I recognize that it is helpful to understand and learn about land use planning from a legal perspective, but it is not always appropriate to have them talk about these issues...Important perspectives that we missed in this class include: technical details and knowledge on energy sprawl and hydraulic fracturing, specific project management perspectives on urban land use projects, scientific understanding of effects on ecosystems (water, wildlife, etc.).",
    "There should be some New Haven oriented topics, guest lecture, site visits, field trips.",
    "the field trip was the best part of the course- wish there had been more!",
    "I really liked attending the Pace Law conference.",
    "Question 1: No one read any of the readings in this class.",
    "I enjoyed the guest lectures very much.",
    "The class should have had a broader emphasis on international issues and aspects around land use and planning.",
    "Ques. 7: The professor did a great job of putting together a roster of interesting speakers representing a wide range of professional applications of land use law, planning, design, etc.",
    "Overall the course did not meet my expectations in terms of content. It should be addressed at the beginning that this course is most interesting or appropriate for law students. While some of the lectures (e.g. fracking, shrinking cities) were very informative, most of the lectures would have been more valuable if the lecturers had focused on conveying a mix of background information and possible solutions. With regard to solutions it would be much more interesting if they were discussed from a regular practitioners point of view rather than from a legal standpoint."

    "Different perspectives on land use",
    "The field trip and the guest lectures. I think this is an excellent 1-credit introductory course to land use planning. I do wish there were more options throughout the school even though Yale does not have a planning school. Most environmental managers will have to deal with the planning process. A course on environmental dispute resolution or negotiations would also be just as helpful in the curriculum, but this should be a more substantial course.I also think Professor Nolon did an excellent job of covering so many different land use topics and brought something for everyone in environmental management.",
    "Uma Outka's lecture on the energy-land use nexus.",
    "the Pace land use center conference",
    "The participation in the conference at Pace Law School.",
    "Variety of speakers and perspectives.",
    "Professor Nolon was the best part of the course. He was extremely knowledgeable and was an engaging speaker. I wish we could have had more lectures where he was the presenter. I also liked how the course covered a variety of topics which allowed students to get a taste of what's out there so that they could take future classes in areas they found interesting. The field trip was also really interesting.",
    "It was easy and you could pay attention when you wanted to pay attention.",
    "I thought the exposure to a wide variety of topics in the land use planning field was excellent.",

    "The professor seemed inspired with the possibilities of planning and land use law, for a sustainable society,and he conveyed this in his presentations.",
    "The hydrofracking talk and the collaborative development talk.",
    "The first lecture on shrinking cities was by far the most engaging. Also, I very much enjoyed the conference at Pace University."

    "Speakers should come from more diverse career\/field\/sector backgrounds.",
