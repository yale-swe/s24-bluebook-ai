    "Sid Cahn is definitely a good instructor for this course, so that's a reason to take it. If you do, try to read up on the physics before lab begins otherwise it can be frustrating to tinker with things you don't understand.",
    "Basic physics lab--don't take it unless you have to, but it's less painful than the chem labs. 1 page reports are not too bad. Try to pick your TA wisely, if you can, because they really affect the lab experience.",
    "you need to take it if your premed\/ if its a pre req. Damn annoying class to take but its pretty easy, doesnt take up too much time",
    "Phys 166L was among my least favorite courses at Yale. It's just a pain. The lab reports are only to take \"one hour\" outside of lab, but because the TAs have such high expectations about what you should include, they end up taking much longer. I struggled to earn grades on the reports that I felt were adequate indicators of the amount of time, thought, and effort that I put in. The lab practical is hard and stressful. Obviously, I would not recommend taking this unless you absolutely have to.",
    "This lab course is among the less time consuming but not the most enjoyable. You'll learn stuff and mess around with some cool instruments (yay lasers).",
    "It's a Physics lab. Not too hard, you'll have to put in some work to be comfortable for the practical exam though.",
    "I would recommend this class because it wasn't too bad in terms of work load and it was relatively fun.",
    "If you're not required to take the course, know that it is a lot of work but definitely interesting and applicable to real life!",
    "Physiccs 166L is a worthwhileintro physics lab. It truly helps integrate the material taught in lecture, and the experiments are easy to follow and interesting.",
    "If you are looking at this you are probably pre-med, in which case it doesn't matter: you have to take it.",
    "It's meant to be painless- the 'reports' are one page summaries. It's not bad at all.",
    "For a lab, it's relatively painless. I thought the experiments helped with understanding the course, and the reports took very little time (2 hours per week outside of lab).",
    "Physics 166L was a good course. A lot of people need to take it for pre-med or for a particular major, and it really was not as painful as some of the other prerequisites. The Professors and TAs were generally understanding and helpful and I would recommend this physics lab over another.",
    "I would recommend this course. do not be afraid to take it all. It is quite laidback and the Ta's and professors really want you to do well. The experiments can be interesting if you invest the appropriate time into them (which isn't too much) although the lab reports can take 1-2 hours to write up, I didn't mind that much and enjoyed writing them. Take this class to get a better, more intuitive understanding of how physics researchers operate and to fulfill any requirements you may have. above all, go into the class with a sense of optimism about what you will learn and discover and you will have a blast!",
    "Odds are, you're here because you have to be. But don't worry, you'll take classes that are significantly worse as you seek to fulfill all of your requirements. I don't love lab, but this class was extremely bearable, and bordered on enjoyable many times throughout the semester. Just make sure you get a calm lab partner.",
    "Often its a requirement. You go through the labs and do one page write ups instead of full blown lab reports (a nice change!) just prepare for the practical (don't blow it off). It (the practical) can become overwhelming because even though it is open note, some of the materials and object you are familiar with is used for completely different purposes, relating to different Physical concepts. This lab I felt was more useful (learning-wise) for correlating to your physics lecture than fall semester lab because many more of the concepts in 2nd semester physics are harder and less intuitive so it really helps to be in the lab and practicing so you can understand this subject matter!",
    "take it only if you need it",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone that does not have to take it. Despite the fact that I liked Sid Cahn, the rest of the drawbacks of the course are not even close to balanced out.(As a side note, this may be largely due to my teaching assistant.)",
    "PHYS 166L is fine. You're probably taking it because you have to. It really isn't bad! The lab practical is tough, but fair if you've done the readings and know how to work all the apparatuses.",
    "yea take it, best pre-med lab at least.",
    "For a lab--a physics lab no less--this is not painful at all. In fact, I'd say it was quite fun. The folks have really tried hard to make it enjoyable, and they've largely succeeded.",
    "You'll probably only take this course because you have to. It's much better than the other science labs although the labs can sometimes be a little boring.",
    "I honestly would recommend this class if you're taking 181 and have a bit of time in your schedule. It's a bit time-consuming, but the lab reports are not bad at all. It really really helped me process the concepts from class, which I think made the difference for me in that class between doing fairly well and \"not great\"",
    "Solid lab, definitely lower stress than chemistry and bio labs. One page lab reports due for each session, but expect to be in lab for the full 3 hours each session if you're going to actually carry out the full procedures. If you don't need this for a requirement, no need to take it.",
    "Yes, it is not a bad class, though it would seem pointless to take it unless required.",
    "If you are taking it, it is because you have to. Not necessarily enjoyable, but not horrible either.",
    "Take it. It is pretty laid back and you learn a lot.",
    "1. It never took 3 hours. Allot yourself at least 4.2. Ask around about TAs. Seriously. Grading is different and doesn't seem as though it'll be accounted for.3. It's a helpful lab; it helped me visualize what was going on in my Physics lecture. It caters more to 171 than 181 (or 201 I guess), which can be frustrating, but isn't a big deal.4. It won't be a lab that dominates your life, but it's definitely harder than 165L andmore time consuming. It's also a little cooler; circuits are more fun than pendulums.",
    "This is your typical physics lab. MAKE SURE you get a good TA. It makes a huge difference.",
    "It's not a lot of work at all and the final practical exam is fairly reasonable. Just make sure you understand how to do all of the labs--don't rush through them just to get out early because you'll regret it when studying for the final.",
    "Less stressful than first semester, good class",
    "Much better than gen chem and orgo labs. Labs and reports are shorter.",
    "I don't think anyone takes this class for fun. So, this question is moot.",
    "This class was a good supplement to PHYS 181. However, when you are scheduling for this class, you will be in lab significantly more than is advertised in the class listing. A few labs this year took around 5 hours.Lastly, choose your TA wisely. Some TAs are very forgiving; others are not.",
    "This introductory physics lab is exactly what you would expect it to be, especially if you've just finished taking 165L. It focuses on electricity and magnetism, with a little bit of optics, and is generally a good course as far as requirements go.",
    "This class is so boring! But it's easy and you probably have to take it...just remember its about the same as first semester but will less dropping things and more voltages.",
    "Not quite as bad as first semester. Labs aren't terrible, just make sure you understand all the concepts during lab so you can do a good job on the writeup. Learn early on what your TA is looking for for the reports and save yourself unnecessary point loss!!!! The final wasn't as terrible as last semester but still was stressful. While we often didn't understand the labs, just ask for help (especially from Rona, she's awesome!) and you'll be fine.",
    "You're probably taking this anyways, because you're premed.Advice: ask questions on the lab final if you need it, don't not do it and screw up your grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that needs to take a physics lab. It is straight forward and not too hard to follow.",
    "If you're pre-med you have to. Otherwise, no.",
    "PHYS 166L is essentially the same in format, structure, and logistics as PHYS 165L, but the experiments are very different and much more complicated. Almost all the experiments in PHYS 166L involve circuits and circuit elements. The labs vary in length (some are very long), but the primary difference from PHYS 165L is that the concepts are a lot more complicated and difficult to understand: the math behind the forced damped simple harmonic oscillator lab and the ray diagrams in the geometric optics lab, for example, are in some cases very difficult to grasp, although the lab manual for the most part does a good job explaining the concepts, and having a good TA helps tremendously. The EKG lab is pretty cool, but is not a major part of the lab as a whole.",
    "Physics 166L is a good introductory lab. The concepts were explained well through interesting (but often very long) experiments. Your grade on lab reports and overall experience in the lab really depends on the TA you have. The final is a practical exam, which was actually pretty difficult compared to what we did in the semester. Like other mandatory intro labs, no one reallywants to be there, but the instructors do make the effort to revise the experiments to accommodate student demand.",
    "This is one of the easiest courses you can take at Yale, but that doesn't make it not fun. It's only worth half a credit, and unlike most labs, it really is only half a credit worth of work. The work is easy if you take it seriously and there's no reason you shouldn't score well unless you fool around.",
    "Really useful if you are taking 181. A manageable workload and well designed experiments.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. It will only add unnecessary stress to your life. If you actually want to learn about physics via a lab, take an upper level lab.",
    "It's a pain but not horrible. Take it if you have to.",
    "Great lab. You'll like it. Short write ups and interesting concepts. Sid is awesome so try to get to know him. Brian is an awesome TA.",
    "It's a pretty relaxed lab, and you learn a lot. I'd say take it, it helps a lot with understanding electricity and magnetism!",
    "Easy lab, very good supplement to 171",
    "If you have to. Much less interesting\/easy\/enjoyable than 165L. And a good TA is everything!",
    "Take it if you have to-- harder than last semester, not as fun, and gets repetitive. Biological relevance seemed a bit forced. TFs were not consistent- I had a really difficult one and we always ended up staying 30 minutes over the end of our lab session while everyone else got out early.",
    "Not too bad. I found it to be much less work-intensive than I thought.",
    "It's physics lab. Better than first semester in my opinion. Each TA has weird grading, so if you get an easy grader, good for you. If not, it may be frustrating. If you want to take it for fun, go for it. It isn't too bad.",
    "It's likely that if you are taking this lab, you are probably doing so because it's required for you. However, 166L to me was much more interesting than 165L, and the labs really go along with the 181 lectures and help illustrate all of the concepts you learn there (or in 171).",
    "It's not the most interesting class, but if you're taking it it's probably because you have to.",
    "Painless; take it because you have to. Make sure you learn how to use the oscilloscope b\/c it'll be on the final!",
    "Good, straightforward, introductory physics lab for the pre-med.",
    "The Physics 166L is a good complement to the material taught in the 181 lecture, though some of the concepts seem like somewhat trivial attempts to cater the lab to biology-oriented people. Be prepared for somewhat tedious lab sessions and an admittedly tricky practical. The workload, however, is very reasonable and, I think, appropriate for a half-credit lab. I would recommend this class if you need to take a physics lab for a major or other requirement.",
    "A great lab. The concepts were more difficult than they were first semester, but still a very good course.",
    "Not bad at all. Lab reports are short and straightforward.",
    "I'd recommend this lab to anyone who needs it to fulfill a pre-med or major requirement, although I've heard 206 is more interesting and you can pick which labs you do.",
    "Not a very good course. If you take it make sure you get a good TA. If possible, take Phys 206L, which i have heard is much less stressful and well run. This course is similar to the first semester but the experiments are harder. The final practical was a little easier but in general I do not recommend this course.",
    "PHYS 166L is probably a required course if you're even thinking about taking it, but I suggest not to go into it with terrible expectations of horrendous circuits and brutal lab reports. The TAs are great, the labs interesting, and the one-page writeups not too difficult at all.",
    "This is how all labs should be run. Still requires a fair amount of work and time, but is much more manageable than other labs I have taken at Yale. The course emphasizes physics relavent for pre-meds, when applicable.",
    "This course is very manageable. It's about 3 hours in class time and a 1 page lab report each week. REALLY simple",
    "This class focuses mostly on waves and electricity (circuits). I would recommend it to a pre-med student.",
    "Surprisingly I liked this lab though I'm not a huge fan of e\/m physics.",
    "it's not very interesting but if you have to take it it is also not too much work.",
    "It's fine -- most of the labs are relatively straightforward and easy to do, and never took too long. It wasn't exactly thrilling, but I didn't find it painful either.",
    "Phys 166L is basically a continuation of Phys 165L, focusing on electromagnetism\/optics. Again, only a 1 pg lab report per week and a practical at the end with some surprise quizzes at the beginning of lab. Overall, it was pretty enjoyable as far as lab goes.",
    "Overall, a pretty stress free and enjoyable physics lab. I think it correlates better with PHYS 181, but I didn't see it as a problem that sometimes it didn't line up with PHYS 171. Reports are only 1 page, and don't take long to do. I really enjoyed my TA, Evan. The practical of PHYS 166L is MUCH better and much more fair than first semester.",
    "I would summarize this course as the logical progression to Physics 165L. If you have to take it to fulfill the yearlong pre-med physics lab requirement, then you have to take it. This semester was, on average, more challenging than the previous semester of physics lab, except the final was a lot more fair in this case. I think the key to success in this class is having a lab partner that you get along well with and with whom you feel comfortable working through the concepts until you understand them. I would also recommend going through all the questions in the lab handout in class, before going home to write up the lab report, in order to make the process of writing the lab report much smoother. (The sooner you do the write-ups, the better!)",
    "It's a good course and it helps in understaning the concepts of 180 or 200",
    "If you're looking at this, you'll most likely have to take this. I recommend reading the labs ahead of time because it makes the labs go by much faster.",
    "Only if they are required to take the course for requirements or really enjoy laboratories.",
    "A standard science lab. Not a lot of fun, but not a huge burden of work. Take it if you have to, but not for fun. I feel like I learned very little and it did not complement the class well.",
    "Physics 166 is your standard second-semester physics lab... pretty much the same deal as 165. Definitely shop TAs, because your TA will make or break your lab experience. If Katrina is TA-ing again, she's great.",
    "Pretty chilled out lab. Instead of writing full lab reports, you just write a summary of what you did that day. The grading can be a little confusing, and it depends on which TA you get. The first few assignments I didn't do too well because I just couldn't figure out what the TA wanted for the assignments.Most of the labs are pretty straight forward and go along with the pace of 181. From what I hear, if you take 171, the lab goes a lot faster than the lecture.",
    "This was a great intro physics lab. We mostly played with circuits to explore electricity and magnetism. The work load was completely manageable - only a one page write up every week.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 166L. The lab as a whole was clearly laid out, the lab handouts were generally easy to follow each week and the experiments always went smoothly. If you're taking this simultaneously with PHYS 181, then the topics investigated will compliment those seen in lecture nicely.",
    "For me, this class was the most painful and dreaded part of each week. To be fair, I really dislike physics in general and am only taking it because I'm pre-med, but I just thought the labs in this class were often unnecessarily tedious. You do get out of labs faster than first semester physics lab, though; that's definitely a plus.",
    "not at all fun in any way. if you're required to take this, its pretty easy although it was by far the worst part of my week, every week. if you dont have to take it, why would you? that is unless you dont mind walking up to science hill and doing long labs and a 1 page weekly report, in which case go right ahead.",
    "Phys 166L is a lot of fun. Not too much work. The practical is iffy.",
    "Take it if you must.",
    "If you have to take a physics lab, this lab is a great lab. It followed physics 181 material pretty closely and did a great job explaining some of the conceptual information. The 1 page lab reports all depend on yourTA. If you get a helpful TA, you will be able to really understand all the concepts while in Lab and doing the report will be really easy.",
    "It's a relaxed lab until it comes to the lab practical. Out of all of the instructors for the lab I had this semester, Rona Ramos was absolutely wonderful, she is so willing to help students really understand the material rather than just get the lab done.",
    "I didn't think this lab was too hard -- it was fun, in fact -- but it all depends on your TA. If Katrina is still teaching next year, try to pick her, she's amazing (and by amazing, I don't just mean \"easy\", she is truly a great teacher). Otherwise I can't really comment.",
    "It's a pretty chill and fun class. Make sure you pick a good lab partner on the first day since interacting with them will be your source of entertainment for the remainder of the semester. Definitely take this over the higher level lab if you don't want to hate yourself ad infinitum.",
    "Win",
    "Physics 166 is nearly identical to 165. The concepts are clearly more difficult (electricity is a little harder to observe than gravity) but overall, if you took 165, you know what you're signing up for. The lab reports still have a 1-page max, so that's great. Overall, totally manageable.",
    "Yes, if they were taking Physics, I would recommend this class. The one page writeups are helpful in teaching and enforcing concise writing while also preventing excessive time consumption.",
    "Take it if you have to, don't take it if you don't"
