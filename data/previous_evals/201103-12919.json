    "Yes, for beginners!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a very interesting class and korean offers a unique angle for East Asian culture. Also to be practical, korean is relatively less competitive than japanese or chinese, especially in terms of light fellowship application.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a logical language and Lim Sunsengnim is a good teacher for it. There's not too much work and the expectations are very reasonable.",
    "It's a constant, small amount of work, but definitely manageable. You'll emerge being able to have simple conversations in Korean.",
    "Take the class!",
    "I really liked learning Korean. I thought the class was very well structured and the focus on oral proficiency was exactly what I wanted to improve on most.",
    "If you are interested in taking Korean in any way, just at least shop the class. Both Korean professors are amazing, and you will end up loving the class from the first day.",
    "I recommend anyone who has an interest in the language to take this class.",
    "Korean 110 is like having a Korean family. The class is small so you get to know everyone and the teacher very well. I think this fosters real progress in the language. So, yes, I definitely recommend this class."
