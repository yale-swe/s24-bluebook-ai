    "Definitely worth it if there's a specific topic you're interested in studying and if you find a professor who's willing to help you throughout the semester. A great way to fulfill one semester of the senior requirement for Psychology majors.",
    "It is what you make it. Very self-directed, need to be self-motivated",
    "I think this is a great way to pursue your own interest of psychology not offered at Yale. For me, that was positive psychology, as reviewed through critiques of two popular psych books. My main suggestion would be that you set up clear guidelines with your advisor on readings, meeting times, draft deadlines (not just final but also first drafts) to mold some structure into an inherently amorphous course.",
    "Learned a lot. wrote a lot. Good way to fulfill part of the senior requirement for psych."
