    "If you are simply looking for a language to fulfill your language requirements (meaning, you're not taking it with specific objectives in mind), I would recommend that you take another language. Compared to some of the other language programs at Yale, like Chinese, the Russian program is not as systematic, which makes it very easy for people to get lost.",
    "Level one russian provides the main basis for russian language. We cover several cases and vocabulary, and put it into practice with daily worksheets, class participation in the language, and biweekly tests. If you put in the work for the class, it definitely pays off. It is not difficult to stay on track, though work is daily, it is rather minimal and concepts are not hard to grasp. Lots of help available as well.",
    "The course is basically your standard introductory course to a language. You learn the alphabet, basic tenses, five cases, and basic vocab. The workbook we use is great as is the video that comes with it. TAKE RUSSIAN.",
    "Yes, if you're serious about learning russian",
    "Great class- I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to put in the time (about an hour of class and an hour of homework each night). The grades are quite lenient.",
    "Russian 110 is a great introduction to the Russian language. It moves quickly, so be ready to put in the effort, but grading is reasonable.",
    "Definitely take the class, by the end of the semester you can actually speak a bit of Russian, and the pace is not at all daunting and allows you time to fully grasp the material.",
    "Absolutely. Russian is an incredible language, and even after a single semester, the things you learn will quickly make you want to continue learning the language. Russian is fun, despite how difficult it is, and Professor Titus makes sure to let her students have a good time getting to know the language."
