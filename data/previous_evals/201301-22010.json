    "everyone presents, basic psych seminar, but the material is really cool and up to date. a little elss discussion than other seminars.",
    "Mostly consists of student-led discussions of recent research in social neuroscience. Worth taking if you're going into neuroscience or psychology.",
    "Great class--you get to read some really cutting edge research on various regions of the brain specialized for social cognition. Reasonable workload, just weekly reading responses and a final paper. Do it.",
    "Worth taking even as a Friday afternoon seminar.",
    "Totally. This is one of the few classes (and the only one I know of) that combines neurosicence with social psychology. Personally I am very interested in the neural circuitry of social decision making, so this class was a blast. Professor McCarthy is a great professor who lectures really well and knows this field thoroughly. Granted, this seminar felt at times like a lecture given how much information is thrown at us and how little time we have left for discussion. However, this field is really starting to explode so it's no wonder that there is so much to learn about. The one concern would be that you really have no idea how you're doing throughout the semester given that there are no feedback on your reaction papers or your participation, but then the same could be said for most other seminars. Love it. Highly recommend taking this seminar.",
    "Take it! If you're interested in the topic, you'll enjoy the readings and class discussion so much.",
    "Two hour seminar once a week. You end up reading about 3-4 articles per week, and have to write a 400-500 word reaction paper before class. During seminar discussion leaders present on the topics. The topics became increasingly interesting as the semester progressed; some of the earlier topics, such as biological motion, didn't interest me too much. But by the end of the semester we were discussing morality, political orientation, and gender differences. You don't need a lot of background in neuroscience for this class -- I had only taken Human Neuro, and I was totally fine. Professor McCarthy and the discussion leaders do a good job of introducing the brain parts and explaining other important concepts."
