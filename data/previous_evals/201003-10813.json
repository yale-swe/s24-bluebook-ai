   "comments": [
    "It is great that a course on alternative energy is being offered, especially at a place like Yale because the professors that teach of the course are also doing the cutting-edge research. Some of the material is an overview of alternative energy and some is specific research that the professor is doing. As a whole, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in one of the most important emerging fields in all scientific disciplines.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to every student. The course can be made as easy as you want it to be since it requires few graded hws(i had maybe 2-3 due the entire semester) and the tests only cover 5-6 lectures(doable in 2 days,even 1, before the test). I would strongly suggest reading some of the papers,especially the review ones, since they give an excellent summary of most of the material being discussed.",
    "Yes I would. Very interesting and too much to learn.",
    "strongly recommended anyone who is interested in energy research as well as the global issues of energy problems. depending on his previous training, some aspects of the course may be hard to understand because they are very different subjects and it's not easy to understand all of them well.",
    "Alternative Energy discusses cutting-edge topics in green energy production and alternate fuel sources. Both the current state of energy production, and a few avenues you likely hadn't considered are discussed. Although there are four professors teaching, it's not as jarring as you may expect.I was shocked more students weren\u0092t taking CHEM505. There aren\u0092t any chemistry electives other than advanced such and such, and taking multiple classes of the like make one\u0092s course load a bit dry. I would certainly recommend CHEM505; the work is reasonable, the topics cover great breadth, and it allows a student to learn from four professors instead of only one. It was the class I looked most forward to this past semester."

    "I am working on solar cell project , so alternative energy sources and the approaches attract my interest. I learnt a lot and I enjoyed the topics.",
    "Alternative Energy gave me a springboard into learning more about the future of energy. Learning about the subject from four different people planning four different curriculums gave me a more objective overview than I think could be expected from a course taught by a single professor. I feel much more like I know what is possible, what is impossible, and what avenues should be focused upon first to solve our energy needs. Moreover, I feel this class gave me an intimate look on the research of each of four labs, exposing me to a wide variety of yet untested hypotheses for our future. Should my career continue deeper into science, energy is a topic of both personal interest and immediate importance. Alternative Energy presented many avenues for my possible pursuit."
