    "Every art history junior has to take this course- but I would not recommend it to a non-major.",

    "Take this class if you are passionate about art or art history. The class entails reading a lot about the discipline of art history, as well as applying the ideas and approaches encountered in the reading to works in the classroom and gallery. I have a feeling that this course is heavily shaped by the professor. So, if you can take this with Joselit, definitely do it.",
    "Only take this if you need to fulfill the requirement for the art history major. It's a dry class and more than having a problem with the readings and structure, you will dislike the other students.--just the definition of \"section assholes\"."
