    "I would recommend it if they are willing to spend 8-16 hours per week drawing. Otherwise, I wouldn't.",
    "It's a lot of work, but very productive if you're passionate. Be prepared for a lot of assignments and a teaching style that's unconventional and definitely not for everyone. You have to have a very open mind in this class, and the things we do can be frustrating at times. I definitely wouldn't recommend this course to everyone, but it works fantastically if you're a certain type of person.",
    "Yes, it's a wonderful art course. I'm shocked by how much I learned.",
    "Basic Drawing helped me think of art in a very different way. It was definitely worth the work. Take it!"
