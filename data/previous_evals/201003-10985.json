    "Yes, this is a helpful an interesting class.We can learn a lot of stuff in it.",
    "Of course, it is a extremely good course.",
    "I would highly recommend (and already actually have) this course to other students. In this course, you cover a variety of numerical methods, starting from a very small previous knowledge base. This allows people with very little background to grasp the material quickly. A working knowledge of a programming language is a must.",
    "I would recommend ENAS 747 to another student. Because it is really helpful and useful, and the instructor leads the course really well.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS 747 to a fellow student who has interest in numerical methods. Also, the fact that the course is divided in two distinct, self-contained, courses makes it really interesting for students who will have to deal with computational applications in their research. Another positive aspect is that the theory and the examples provided in class do not address any specific field of engineering, which makes ENAS 747 suitable for students coming from different backgrounds."

    "This introduces a wide knowledge of numerical methods, and we can check out some reference provided by the professor if we need.",
    "It is not directly related to my research. But it broadened my thinking!",
    "I am doing modeling, therefore the numerical methods knowledge is very useful to my research. This course helps develop my research a lot.",
    "I still do not know how the course will contribute to my dissertation\/research, but I can tell that especially the section on the solution of linear systems is important for anybody who is interested in computational work."
