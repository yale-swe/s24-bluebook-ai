   "comments": [
    "This course taught me about the importance of the relationship between the media and the government. I learned that the media is an institution with a great deal of power in the U.S. It not only reports on government action, but has strong influence over how policy creation is carried out.",
    "I learned a ton. There is a whole language of politic, journalism, and political journalism that I had never experienced before.",
    "I developed deeper analysis skills and an ability to look beyond and investigate a resource further than I did before.",
    "This course provided me with the opportunity to view politics through a new lens. It made me rethink the relationship between the media, political policies, and political actors, and (if I am being honest) it made me even more cynical than I was before. It was exciting taking this class in the midst of the 2016 election.",
    "Learned about journalism and the impact that it can have on public policy. Professor Slap's experience in the fields of journalism and politics allowed for a great learning experience."

   "comments": [
    "The course does a great job of discussing the complex relationship between the government and media. Each class was filled with thought-provoking discussion and reference to the contemporary media landscape. In this way, the course was always fresh and interesting. It can be improved with an increase in organization. There were many times when we weren't able to discuss the weekly readings for class because we got sidetracked by other discussion. Many times, the class just felt like a freeform discussion and I walked out not exactly knowing what I had learned that week. For this reason, Political Journalism and Public Policy can definitely be improved by having some more concrete structure.",
    "The topic for the course is highly interesting. This class gave some great insight into how interconnected the world of politics and journalism truly are. I really enjoyed the presentations, which gave some great perspective regarding the diversity and depth of impact journalism can have. The class at times can be repetitive, but Professor Slap keeps things interesting with personal stories of the field.",
    "The course material was extremely interesting but after the first few weeks, it felt extremely repetitive. Also I didn't love that the two big assignments of the course had the same (admittedly vague) prompt.",
    "While I really enjoyed the readings and the public policy presentations for this class, I sometimes felt that seminar discussion became repetitive, especially in the second half of the semester. Perhaps more management of these later discussions could have prevented this.",
    "This class has fascinating content and the class discussions were great. Professor Slap is engaging and his experience really adds to the syllabus. Readings were good, although sometimes repetitive, and the workload was completely manageable. Because the presentation and the paper were on something of your own choice, the class was great at allowing every person to find something fascinating to write about. One weakness I would say is that I often had no idea how I was doing. We did reading responses, but they weren't graded, so if your presentation was at the end, it was hard to know how well you were doing. To improve the class, a simple mark out of 5 for the responses would be a valuable tool! Otherwise, great way to spend Friday afternoon.",
    "It was a great course but its biggest weakness was that sometimes one or two students domineered the discussion. I think however this was more based on the Students we had in the class and not professor Slap.",
    "I think the main weakness of the course was the disconnect between the readings and the class discussions. Although the workload was quite manageable throughout the semester, each week we would come to class having written a one page reading response on the reading, and yet we never really went that in-depth. In addition, the class was incredibly backloaded, with a power point presentation, SWOT analysis, and research paper all within the last week. While I did not mind it, as it meant the rest of the semester was more relaxing, it meant that I did not really have a sense of how I was doing at any point throughout the semester. All of this being said, the class discussions were always engaging and exciting, and everyone came prepared with interesting things to say.",
    "Both the class discussions and work were very interesting. Professor Slap always brought humor, fascinating anecdotes, and a wealth of experience in the journalism and political fields to each class. While many readings were great, some often seemed repetitive. The takeaways from each reading were quite often relatively the same and there were some that I didn't get much out of. Overall a fantastic class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in discussing journalism and public policy from a theoretical perspective. If you like talking about the problems with media, how it can be improved, and how government has changed because of it, this is the right course for you. You will not be partaking in the practical writing of journalism stories. The course has a decent amount of reading and weekly reading responses, both of which take up a good amount of time. But other than the readings, the course revolves nearly exclusively around weekly discussion and a few end-of-semester projects. Professor Slap is one of the highlights of the course.",
    "Yes, Prof. Slap is an incredible resource and instructor and the subject matter was fascinating",
    "I learned a ton. There is a whole language of politic, journalism, and political journalism that I had never experienced before. I might have preferred it more as a lecture - discussion could drag out. I liked when Professor Slap did powerpoints. Funny, laidback guy. Full of anecdotes\/insider knowledge. Sometimes the anecdotes could get kind of off track! He was really nice and articulate. Gave me a perspective on the news and the type of media I consume.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "This class was a very classic political science seminar in that it was a bunch of the most boisterous students talking about the same issues every class. This class is good if you want to talk about media bias and what gets covered, and the presentations and paper did get me learning about specific media impacts. But the books were not very fun to read (besides Bai) and every class we talked about much of the same issues- and none of them really related to policy in a concrete way. I think it would be better to actually delve into a different policy area each class and read fun books or journalistic pieces about how the media influences that area. We also had to write a page-long single spaced reading response every week, which was kind of a pain and were for the most part never brought into class discussion or used in any way. But a fun class if you like talking about the media for sure.",
    "This course is fantastic and Professor Slap is a great resource of information, kind, and very understand. Definitely do it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was interesting learning about the relationship between the media and politics from someone who has worked in both fields. In addition, the workload is manageable and the class only meets once a week, so it is definitely worth it. I also loved listening to all of the presentations that took place.",
    "Great class! Professor Slap is hilarious and outstanding, and has many amazing stories from his work in the journalism and political fields. Discussions are very interesting, as is all the work in the class. Highly recommend this class to anyone interested in political journalism, legislative work, or politics in general!!"
