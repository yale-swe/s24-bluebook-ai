    "I loved this class and learned so much about the advertising industry - its elemental composition, mechanisms used and the agents involved.",
    "I knew nothing about advertising\/marketing so I really learned a whole new perspective to business.",
    "i learned that i hate sociology.",
    "Learning to analyze ads from a sociological perspective.",
    "This class was an introduction to advertising and how sociological theory is applied.",
    "This class will make you question every ad you see and essentially make you hate the advertisement industry",
    "Very cool concepts in advertising that I've actually referenced in conversations outside the classroom. A different perspective for ads.",
    "Learned how an advertising works from beginning to end",
    "I learned a lot about the history of advertisements and their influence",
    "I felt like a large majority of the class was common sense. I don't think, aside from some insights about the advertising world, that I learned a ton.",
    "I learned to analyze and evaluate sociological studies and papers. I also have developed an understanding of advertising as a medium and the structures of the ad industry.",
    "A good mix of topics on the intersection of marketing and sociology. Provides a good survey of sociological concepts, before dealing with case studies on advertising. Sometimes a bit too densely packed, but generally effective.",
    "In section I gained the skills of learning how to talk about things that are normally too touchy to talk about in casual conversations - like race and sexuality and gender identities.",
    "I learned how someone takes a sociological approach to a topic.",
    "I learned some basic scholarly concepts regarding marketing and advertising.",
    "I've learned how to use a sociological perspective to evaluate ads. A lot of the course was dedicated solely to how ad agencies proceed with their background research before launching a campaign.",
    "Very few. This class did not teach me anything notably new.",
    "Great course to learn all about advertisements and the ways that the media influences consumers. You'll never look at an ad the same way. Really came to understand the intricacies of targeting consumers from a brand\/ad agency's perspective.",
    "Meaning making through advertising\/branding, what happens in advertising firms, gender and race as problematized in advertising and consumption, creativity, advertising pitches, social networks, sociology of brands, and why advertising is evil. Learned about advertising's role in society",
    "Almost none, the class was very poorly organized and grading policies\/expectations were not clear."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There should be an 'advertising and society part II' course offered for students interested in continuing to learn in this area. Maybe that class could have more hands-on engagement with designing and implementing ad campaigns, or doing things that other ad agencies do, etc.",
    "I loved this course, and found it extremely interesting. Both Professor Wherry and Mr. Cohen were very good lecturers and I like that they posted lecture slides online for review. The written papers and no exams were a large reason as to why I took the class.",
    "Very interactive which is great! A lot of focus on readings - could be cool to do more investigative work",
    "this was truly the worst course i have taken at yale. advertised as a low key class on advertising, i learned very little about advertising and instead spent hours wading through abstract and frankly stupid readings. how am i supposed to learn about modern advertising when i am reading a philosophical piece from 1928???? really, don't take this. section is always a struggle but I truly dreaded going to class everyday where the lecture was always on the incredibly boring readings and the professors would make \"jokes\" that i really can't even call a joke because they were so stupid. i left almost every day in a bad mood, that's how bad this was. this shouldn't be offered again. if it is, don't take it. strengths = 0, weaknesses = infinite.",
    "I think the syllabus should have stated at the outset that the class is more about sociology than advertising. People were misled by the class title and felt shortchanged. The quizzes were too focused on the nitty-gritty.",
    "This class had very interesting content and engaged professors. However, the class was too long and sometimes dragged on. Being that it was an hour and fifteen minutes two times a week in addition to a fifty minute section, many students including myself felt that it was too much and could get uninteresting. Also, I did not appreciate the changes to the syllabus that occurred during the semester. Given that this was a new course I am hopeful that these things would be ironed out for next year.",
    "Keep the quizzes weekly. Don't drop off, then have a cumulative quiz from the previous 4 weeks.",
    "Workload at the end of the semester got to be a lot all at once - I think this could have been remedied by finalizing the syllabus before the semester started so students could plan course assignments accordingly. I really enjoyed the reading quizzes and class notes we did, I found them to help solidify the key concepts (especially from the super long readings). Section was BY FAR the best part of this class. In fact, Javed and his lively\/engaging section were the only reason I stayed in the class. The professor was also full of himself which led to a lot of wasted class time where he just bragged about a certain advertising convention he had been to, committee he was on, etc - that had no relevance to our discussion at the time. Not the first time a Yale professor has done this in class.",
    "The information was presented in an easily digestible way. The readings were interesting. The papers were extremely fun to write. The overall topic choices were interesting but I also enjoyed the freedom of choosing our specific topic within the broad topic. The lectures were sometimes hard to follow or did not have a clear take-away. Section seemed to be an odd use of time.",
    "Strengths- interesting domain area, assignments are fun and well timed. Weakness- lectures are so boring, no need for section, and attendance policy is ridiculous",
    "Some of the assignments didn't feel intellectually stimulating - they were fun, but also felt very high school",
    "Some of the readings are incredibly boring and seem like common sense. The best parts of the class were reviewing and analyzing advertisements, but learning about sociology itself was very boring. As well, the professors altered the syllabus a month before the end of class, changing individual presentations to group projects that were very hard to coordinate, and changing the final paper idea. I did not appreciate the last-minute change, as at the beginning of the semester, a lot of students were expecting one thing and we got another.",
    "Some of the readings, though I understand they are meant to provide a theoretical or historical context, still seemed irrelevant and difficult to engage with the materials. The exercises in which we closely analyzed an advertisement was engaging and the paper prompts were stimulating.",
    "Again, an effective survey class. Perhaps too many topics were covered in too short a time span, but concepts were generally well-taught.",
    "The class was not organized perfectly such that the actual requirements ended up being different than what the syllabus said.",
    "I wish there was more on advertisements that we see, and that we are engaged in (more videos).",
    "Wasn't the most thrilling of a course, but section provided great discussion",
    "Strengths: Good readings that get to be applied to case examples sometimes in section. Engaging sections. Group projects and field trips. Weaknesses: Unengaging lectures some time. The weight of certain assignments and the page requirement of essays change throughout the class. Unexplained changes to grades after they were already assigned.",
    "Assignments should have been distributed more evenly throughout the semester",
    "Strengths: dynamical course with good use of media; the papers let you develop critical skills when you think about consumption; I liked how Mr. Cohen would bring lots of current content when he was lecturing. Weaknesses: the readings were too excessive\/redundant; sometimes I'd get out of lecture without knowing what the point of that whole lecture was. I wish sections would use multimedia material, such as video commercials, and let the class analyze it instead of being a reiteration of the readings (which is what lectures already intend to do).",
    "The lecturers were boring and drawn-out. The material was not presented in a stimulating way nor was it connected to a larger picture or theme to make augment its importance.",
    "Loved how lectures were enjoyable and sections were engaging. I thought there were a fair amount of assignments but maybe would have liked to trade one of the papers for something different (maybe a few smaller assignments).",
    "Strengths: easy, covered many aspects of advertising, some of the lectures were pretty engaging as they used recent advertisements and videos. I feel like I have a great understanding of many different aspects of advertising and consumption. Both Andrew and Prof Wherry were fun and interesting. I really liked the days when we did in-class exercises. Weaknesses: some lectures were a little dry (namely, the history of advertising section). The course was new as a lecture so it was a little bumpy. I think it would've been much better as a seminar because we could've had much more interesting discussions, rather than listening to a lecture and having people not want to answer questions that were posed in front of a large class. The final pitch project could've been so much better if we were in smaller groups (it was hard to coordinate large groups), and if there were more pitch prompts. For the last 2 classes, we heard about 6 very similar pitches and it was pretty boring. I was disappointed in the prompts for the final paper because it seemed too straightforward and not that intellectually challenging. I also wish we had gone more into the consumption side of the class or focused more on the connections to sociology. Again, that probably could've happened if it were a seminar.",
    "Andrew Cohen, the graduate student predominantly responsible for the course, presented a massive hurdle to effective learning within the class. Assignments and deadlines were changed as last minute as hours before the expected due date in the case of quizzes. He constantly interfered with effective intra-section learning, going as far as to change grades given to students by their TA's despite having no part in helping to hone or develop these works or ideas. Would not recommend taking this course as long as Cohen has any part in it, and would present similar concerns with any class he is associated with in the future.",
    "This course had two instructors. The main issue was that one professor seemed to communicate information more efficiently, while the other it was unclear what he was trying to get across. The class could be more organized."

   "comments": [
    "It was a really great experience to learn from two instructors who have experience with and are passionate about the topics of the course. Mr. Cohen has worked extensively in advertising, and Prof. Wherry specializes in the sociology of markets. Both instructors have a good teaching style, and come off as genuinely interested in facilitating learning and engagement. BUT. The class is difficult, and the grading is harsh.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to anyone at Yale regardless of major. It was extremely interesting and given our everyday exposure to the media very enlightening.",
    "Yes - very unconventional course. we need more courses like this",
    "again, this was my least favorite class at yale. don't take it under any circumstances. there really is nothing in here about advertising, it is all obscure sociology and readings from the 1920s. how you are supposed to learn about modern day advertising with readings that are 100 years old is absolutely beyond me. the lectures simply regurgitate these awful readings and i have no idea how any of this material possibly applies to life. seriously, don't take it. they claim it isn't a lot of work but 3 papers, weekly reading quizzes, a group presentation and lecture attendance sure seems like a lot of work to me. left every day in the worst mood ever because it was such a complete waste of my time.",
    "If you want to learn about sociology thru advertising but not the other way around, do it. There are a lot of random assignments. Workload is disproportionately concentrated in April.",
    "I don't recommend this class to anyone at Yale. Really poorly taught and not engaging at all. If I e even went to class I ended up doing other work and not paying attention at all. That said, if you need a gut its a great class for it. Only 3 papers and a presentation. I assume they will change the course in the future to make it better because there were a lot of complaints.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "This was a great class that was fairly graded. I would recommend it.",
    "We were the guinea pig year but I think a lot of the syllabus\/planning issues we experienced will be sorted out moving forward (I hope!). This iteration of the course involved reading quizzes, 2 short papers (4-5 pages), an in-class presentation, and one \"long\" paper (5-7) pages. No midterm or final exams! Wasn't a gut class based on grading and assignments but was VERY INTERESTING. I would recommend the class if you're at all interested in advertising\/marketing. I had taken Intro to Marketing at the SOM the semester before this and the two complemented one another. Section was BY FAR the best part of this class. In fact, Javed and his lively\/engaging section were the only reason I stayed in the class. If he's a TA again try to get him!!!!",
    "Of course! Learning how to view advertising from a sociological perspective is fantastic!",
    "Andy is the best!!! take this course just for him!",
    "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed this class",
    "I'm not sure that I would. This class didn't exactly explore advertising in the way that I had hoped: examining specific advertising strategies, seeing what works and what doesn't. Yes, we do that, but there's a very heavy sociological approach that can be very dry. The class was also very easy. There were reading quizzes each week, but if you scanned the readings, they were doable.",
    "Keep in mind that this is a sociology course, not a class on advertising, per se. It felt a little disorganized at times since this was the first run but I'm sure this can be improved. Some of the readings were engaging and really changes the way you read\/consume advertising.",
    "A good introductory class to take in the sociology department, and one that does not require an excessive amount of work (though it does require some).",
    "Yeah!",
    "I'm not a sociology major, so the perspective this class takes may not have clicked with me at all, but the topic of advertising is very interesting. I would only recommend it for really dedicated students looking into the sociological analyses of advertising and companies.",
    "If you are curious about a sociology class, I think it is good, but overall it was a little slow for me and I was not engaged during lectures.",
    "I would for sure reccomend this course. It was awesome",
    "Yes, if you want a relaxed introduction to advertising from an academic point of view. Not taught like a business class but an academic sociology class.",
    "I'd recommend taking the course if you can take very long redundant sociology readings. I really liked Mr. Cohen's lectures because of how dynamic they were. Your section experience varies a lot depending on the TA you get: it can be totally chill or you might get a TA who likes to quiz you on the readings. A little more discussion abut commercials and less about the readings (which we already have quizzes and lectures for) would be much better. The fact that there are no exams is great, because you get done with everything earlier, and writing the papers can actually be fun depending on the topic! Some of the lectures, especially in the beginning of the semester were rather boring though, and be aware that they'll take attendance every once in a while. Also, be prepared for a few syllabus' changes throughout the semester, but nothing radical.",
    "Absolutely! If you're interested in learning about more practical applications of sociology and sociological thought, I strongly recommend this course.",
    "YES! This was hands down my favorite class at Yale so far. The profs were awesome and fun to learn from but still got down to business and taught interesting stuff everyday.",
    "I'd recommend it because although the course had flaws, I think that was just because it was the first semester that it was taught as a lecture. If you do the readings and engage in section, you can really learn a lot about branding and meaning in ads. I am a sociology major so that aspect of the course interested me, but many others took the course because they wanted to become a marketing consultant. I imagine the course would've been less interesting for them because much of it was theoretical; it is not a crash course on how to advertise. Rather, you gain insight into the world of advertising and consumption. I especially loved the second half of the course which focused on gender, race, and the evil nature of advertising.",
    "Please do not take this course as long as it is being taught by these two professors. It is disorganized and it would be an absolute travesty to use a Yale College credit for whatever this class was."
