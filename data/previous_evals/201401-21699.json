   "comments": [
    "There's not much deciding to do if you're an econ and math major. Otherwise, just know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "Yes",
    "Eh... You'll not learn many more concepts than in the easy game theory class. You'll just analyze overly complicated games, which gets annoying soon. Game theory could definitely be taught in a more interesting way. Also, make sure you know some basic real analysis, you'll need it.",
    "It's a good course with Neeman, but he's just visiting, so this might not be relevant in future years. Homeworks are generally not too hard, although if you don't keep up they can get really annoying. Midterm was straightforward, but Final not so much, probably because I didn't look at a lot of the material he covered. It also seemed to be more econ-y (if that's a word), which is why it's an econ class. Keep up in the course and you'll be fine. TA is awesome ;).",
    "Lectures were usually pretty good, problem sets got real tough at the end. Came away knowing stuff. The final was unexpected and did not really cover the 75% of the course after the midterm, more like a specific 20%.",
    "I mean, you're probably looking to take this for Math & Econ (it's required) and possibly Applied Math. I think with Zvika the class was easier than it has been in the past, so it's probably a good bet. It has the normal econ curve which is nice. There wasn't a ton of work during the semester, just psets every week graded on a check basis. One thing is that the final is worth 60% of your final grade (and there were only 3 questions), which is sort of rough in terms of stress level.",
    "Very hard. Sure, the prof wasn't the same, but the material, in general, can be hard to grasp or visualize at times. If you want to do all the psets and actually understand all the material, prepare to put in a lot of time.",
    "If you liked econ 159 or another intro level game theory course (and are mathematically inclined), I suggest ECON 351. It is a mathematically rigorous course, and the problem sets were very time-consuming. Luckily, Zvika Neeman's exams were much simpler than the homework. He teaches everything out of his own stack of lecture notes, which had a tendency to be very unclear; make sure you ask questions to clarify these!",
    "A great class to take for the math\/quant\/econ student. A strong understanding in basic (by basic I mean advanced) mathematics and economics would be helpful A challenging, but rewarding class",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with a good mathematical background.",
    "This course starts out quite well but then the notes get more and more disorganized and the homework becomes impossible to do because none of the relevant material can be found anywhere. I'm not sure if I understand much beyond the first half of the course. Also beware that the final is 60% of the grade and this year covered something that was not found in any problem set.",
    "Course got very conceptually difficult near the end of the semester. Felt that tests were more a show of how smart you were rather than how well you studied example problems and homework problems, as they did not really directly relate. If you are really interested or need it for Econ and Math, take it. Otherwise not really worth it. Convinced me that Econ and Math wasn't for me",
    "Worst class I took at Yale.",
    "Interesting class, and a really comprehensive approach to game theory. Only problem is that it can get pretty hard. The proofs on the problem sets are tough and the material can be very theoretical at times. That being said, Professor Neeman does a good job of explaining things in simple terms. Probably only worth taking if you're set on being an Econ\/Math major.",
    "I'm a regular econ major who took this instead of the regular game theory course. It was tough, but definitely worthwhile. If you read early and often, you'll do fine. Professor Neeman is great and makes the learning enjoyable."
