    "Spanish L3 is a good course. Unfortunately, Cifuentes will no longer be teaching at Yale. Discussion is a huge part of this course. You will learn most of the grammar and vocabulary through the textbook, which is not very good. I recommend shopping around for different teachers. I strongly recommend that you review the concepts mentioned in the syllabus before you take the class if you are placed into L3.",
    "If you need a language credit then take this class. It's challenging with all the grammar but it fulfills the requirement.",
    "An excellent intermediate level Spanish course. This is the best you are going to get anywhere, because you genuinely improve your Spanish by leaps and bounds. And the coursework is FUN.",
    "Overall a pretty good course.",
    "Yes its required and fun",
    "Absolutely. It usually depends on what teacher you get - your experience varies with each teacher, but it's an exceptional course. A lot of work, but you get what you get for 1.5 credits.",
    "Spanish 130 was a class that at times seemed so easy that it almost bored me because of its repetitiveness. All in all though, I definitely got a more solid grammar foundation so the goal of the course was reached.",
    "Spanish 130 reinforces and clarifies the grammar learned in L1\/L2, while focusing on building fluency and comprehension of Spanish materials (listening, reading, writing). I would recommend taking this class and not stopping at L2 because to really get the hang of Spanish, this extra semester is really necessary - otherwise, I don't think we'd retain the Spanish.",
    "Ok course. Take it if you really love Spanish or need it.",
    "Yovanna! best spanish teacher ever! of course, she's leaving, so you won't be able to take anything with her. in fact, i don't know that anyone will ever read this evaluation. hmm... well, if it's not her teaching, the class in itself is really not so great. it's just a review of spanish I and II, but with way harder grading. but hey, you don't have a choice. take the intensive. the kids are way more into it, and the pace is better.",
    "All language classes below L5, by nature of meeting five days a week, encourage rampant burnout. I hated having a substantial chunk of written work to complete every night, but at least a mixture of media in assignments (movies, short stories, online videos) added some variety to the task.That said, my Spanish certainly improved with Yovanna, who unfortunately won't be teaching next year. In picking an L3 class, definitely shop around for teachers and sections; finding the right fit, especially when you're seeing people every day, will make or break."
