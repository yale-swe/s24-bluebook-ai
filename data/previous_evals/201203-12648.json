    "Given the nature of the course, EENG 471 will vary widely from student to student because it is an independent project course. Because the course is so open-ended, the weaknesses of the course were really personal weaknesses; if our group had devoted more time to our project early on, we wouldn't have had such a crunch at the end. That said, I think that's partially the nature of such projects, and it wasn't too bad in the end! It was fun to have the time and space to follow our own interests - this is really a \"build something awesome\" course. I thought this course was immeasurably improved by the presence of the CEID and the various resources there. We also found it very important to have a faculty member who engaged with our project and wanted us to succeed."
