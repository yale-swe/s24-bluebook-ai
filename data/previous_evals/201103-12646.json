    "Take it! You'll love it- Prof Mikhail is enthusiastic about his field and the students in his class. Plus the subject is really interesting and quite unique- Mikhail said that there aren't any classes like it at other schools.BUT, get your primary sources in advance and don't wait till the last minute with your research paper!",
    "I enjoyed this seminar overall -- many of the readings were interesting, the professor was accessible, and I definitely learned to look at history through another lens. However, since the field is fairly new there are definitely some readings that were drier, and we tended to come back to the same conversations by the end of many classes. There was certainly a range of interests and experience in the room, so don't be intimidated by that!",
    "As you can tell from the title, it's a very niche class. Look through the reading list--if that interests you, you should take it. The only assignments are a class presentation, a book review, and a final, primary source-based research paper. What's cool about it is that a lot of the texts we read came out this fall--it's a super topical and emerging field.However, you should know that the discussions were all student-led, and I felt like all that I got from the class was from the texts, and I liked most of the texts, so that was alright, but going to class always felt kind of pointless. Funny, though, I've heard from people who took the class last year that he was one of the very best discussion leaders they'd ever had. I think the quality of discussion was driven (down) by the class, I'm not convinced it's Mikhail's doing. I found myself barely saying anything in class, which probably made it look like I didn't read any of the books, but I actually read all of them very closely, and just didn't have anything to add to the discussion.Finally, though Mikhail gives you very little direction, the final paper was one of the very best academic experiences I've (ever) had. I picked a really ambitious topic and primary source, and I had an amazing experience. I don't think you'd get that if you blew it off and did it at the last minute, but itmade the class worth it for me.The time was weird--7-9 Monday nights. I thought that would be really convenient and I'd be really awake then, but I found it conflicted with a lot of things and I was always really tired.",
    "Cautious recommendation. Be prepared for a relatively free-form discussion without a lot of professor participation and driven by student presentations and discussion questions. Professor Mikhail is very approachable and a really nice guy. I wish there were a bit more structure to the course.Assignment is basically 1 book per week which is then discussed in class. Books were good about 2\/3 of the time. They cover a wide range of topics within M.E. Env Hist both temporally and topically.Assignments relatively minimal: aside from readings, one 5-pager and one 10-pager based on a primary source. Not a lot of pressure to \"exceed expectations\" although if you find the right sources the research can be very informative.Now that he has taught the class twice, chances are the administration of the course will be improved.",
    "Yes. Definitely take this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. You will learn a lot not about not only the Middle East and its environment but also about historiography and about how the environment is dominant in many human narratives. This class brought together three seemingly separate areas of study, and at their intersection was something really interesting and unique. It's a somewhat new area of study which is both a pro and a con. It's a pretty exciting field of study but there's also limited information\/readings, so some of the readings are definitely better than others, and the concepts seems a little repetitive by the end. Professor Mikhail is fantastic, is very accessible, and leads the discussions effortlessly.",
    "If you are interested in environmental history then you will enjoy this course. The emphasis is subtly but significantly heavier on learning about the Middle East from the perspective of the environmental history than it is on the Middle East itself. Take a good look at the readings before committing to the course because what is there is what the class will be discussing for months, so if it looks like that may get redundant then you may want to reconsider.",
    "This class is interesting but sometimes confusing if you don't know much about the middle eastern history. There is a lot of reading and the discussions can get repetitive, but if you put time into understanding the reading the subject matter is quite interesting. Prof Mikhail is helpful and funny, and really tries to help you with your final research project, which can be tedious but is very informative.",
    "Take it if you're actually interested in the subject matter. Mikhail is a baller. The most frustrating parts of this class had to do with the students--rando history majors getting their rest of the world credit who either seriously didn't care or were not very smart. Mikhail is a good discussion leader, though, and approximately half the readings are pretty interesting, so take it if the syllabus looks good to you.",
    "For anyone interested in environmental history, this class will let you put your skills to work. Instead of simply learning about environmental history you will be asked to become the environmental historian- to think and write like one. If you've only spent time learning the facts of environmental history until this point, this may be challenging at first, but it's rewarding- especially since middle eastern environmental history is a somewhat new field. Be prepared to do ALL your reading!"
