    "Astro 210 is actually surprisingly easy given that it is the hardest level of intro Astro \u0096 I would highly recommend not taking anything below it. The material is interesting, the problem sets are fun and the exams are easy, so if you're interested - take it, but it's not a stellar class.",
    "If you're interested in astronomy and astrophysics and would like to challenge yourself a little bit, I would recommend this class. It's not tough, although requires some work for psets and exams.",
    "ASTRO 210 is not an overview of astronomy, but rather a course that goes slightly in depth to several topics, primarily the life cycle of stars. I would recommend it if the student has interest in astronomy.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an easy A with interesting scientific material.If your key interest is mathematic rigor, don't take this class."
