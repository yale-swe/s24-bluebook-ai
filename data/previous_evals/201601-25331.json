    "TAKE IT. BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN AT YALE. Rearrange you schedule if you need to. Just do it.",
    "A course that prepares students for the real world with Marsha at the helm.",
    "THST 412 is a fun class with almost zero work, if taken with Marsha Norman. Basically, you sit every week with Marsha and talk about life in musical theatre and how she approaches writing books for musicals. You'll learn Marsha's attitudes towards working with collaborators, balancing a career, and what a traditional, commercially oriented Broadway musical should look like. However, this is not a typical Yale course. Don't expect academic rigor or significant growth as a writer. Instead, expect a fun discussion with Marsha Norman each week in which you bring some ideas\/small bits of writing to class some weeks (not all--and she never collected anything) and discuss them briefly. This is a great opportunity to get to know an important figure in contemporary American theatre, and would make a great 5th or 6th class. With another teacher, I can't speak to what the class would be like--I expect it'd be enormously different.",
    "This was a wonderful class! Studying with Marsha Norman was an incredible experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed both the artistic and practical elements of the course, as well as the thoughtful and lively discussion that took place. I would be shocked if anyone who has ever met or worked with Marsha has ever had a single bad word to say about her. Admittedly, given her vast accomplishments, I was a bit nervous going into the class, but she very quickly made the classroom a comfortable and fun environment, because she is so incredibly caring. Marsha is deeply invested in her students--in providing them with a well-rounded education that includes not just technical instruction but also professional and personal skills that are crucial to develop in any creative, competitive field. She taught us how to collaborate effectively and how to own one's work confidently, even in the face of threat to one's creative control. I know I will take the skills Marsha taught in Libretto Writing with me wherever my career may take me. I would highly recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in any aspect of the theater world (or, for that matter, any other creative sphere).",
    "A college tea with Marsha Norman for three hours every Friday. Don't approach this class (at least in its current incarnation) with any aspirations to write a musical unless you are entirely self motivated. Do come to this class with a notebook waiting to write down the gems of insight that Marsha Norman spins out about the process of writing, the structure of musicals, why we go to theater, and what it means to be a collaborator."
