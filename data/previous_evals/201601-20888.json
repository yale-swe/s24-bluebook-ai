    "It's what you expect to get out of an L4 course!!",
    "VIET 140 is a challenging yet rewarding course for students who are motivated to refine their skills in the Vietnamese language. It is important to keep up with the material and to attend class. I would recommend to students who have received the necessary preparation.",
    "A fantastic course! It's fun and interesting - class is always a blast, and Thay Quang is great! If you get a chance, check out any of the Viet classes. We learn a lot of cool things about Viet culture that you wouldn't necessarily know even if you're Viet, and Thay has a ton of great stories. It's also really fun getting to know people in the class, and it felt like one big family by the end. Highly recommend!"
