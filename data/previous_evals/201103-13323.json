   "comments": [
    "I loved this course. Not too much work (4 papers, of which the first three require an ungraded first draft, and then a graded revision). You get to delve into great material (from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics to the movie, The Social Network). Most of my peers had great ideas and were interesting to have discussions with. Professor Hopper, though young and relatively new at teaching, is great; she's very informed and highly dedicated, and gives great feedback on your drafts. She's also very understanding with deadlines; go talk to a writing tutor\/partner, and you get a 24-hour extension. As a literature lover, I was sometimes dissatisfied with the lack of profound analysis in class discussions, but the class discussions were relevant and important in their own way, and I was able to have fun with literary analysis on my own in my papers. If you're looking into ENGL 114 and don't know which section to take, I highly recommend this one; after all, how often do you get to learn, read, and discuss about friendship?",
    "I was really not looking forward to having to take an English class, but I actually ended up really enjoying this class! Definitely take if you are at all interested or need to fulfill an English requirement!",
    "An intense writing class which I would recommend to somebody who is really interested and can dedicate enough time to the class in order to improve their writing.",
    "Absolutely. If you are looking to improve your writing skills this a great class. I feel like I ma such a better and more confident writer then I was when I came into Yale.",
    "It is a class created in order to improve your writing skills. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking to bring their writing to a college level.",
    "I would most definitely recommend a writing seminar, especially Professor Hopper's. My writing improved a great deal over the course of one semester. Not only do you get to improve your writing and read the writing of others, you get to do it with fun and interesting prompts\/topics!",
    "English 114 (Friendship) is meant to be more a writing class than a classabout discussion of friendship. Some may find this helpful for their writing, but others may scorn at the idea that one can learn about writing without addressing writing's purpose--persuade the reader using valid arguments to a position you strongly believe. As a result, I came out of the class lacking. Maybe my writing did improve, but I was forced to use outside inspiration to engage my ideas on friendship as opposed to debating them thoroughly in the context of the classroom.",
    "Good class- teaches lots of writing! Take it :) Professor Hopper is a nice and kind soul who will really try to help you improve.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course for students. Coming out of high school you may think you are an amazing writer but college is on a whole new level. I suggest that you take this course before any higher level course so you can get a basic understanding of what college professors are expecting.",
    "Yes, I found the course very helpful in developing my college writing. At the end of the course I felt that my writing had improved thanks to the nature of the classes."
