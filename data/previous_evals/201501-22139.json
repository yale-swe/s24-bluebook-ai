    "This course was a lot of work but very rewarding. You will build confidence with your speaking abilities and learn a lot about World War II.",
    "I would recommend taking French 140, especially with Professor Ngame. The course material is interesting, and Ngame is a super fun professor who does a great job teaching you the material without being super tough.",
    "Great continuation of French 130. Ngame is an excellent professor, and you get to branch out of France and read stories by authors from Vietnam, Congo, Canada, and various other Francophone countries. If Ngame is teaching a section, re-arrange your schedule to have him. He's absolutely wonderful. Cannot recommend him enough. The reading is slightly difficult towards the end of the semester, reading about 50 pages of dense French a night, but he does an excellent job of reviewing the plot and characters for you. Take this course ! Continue your French !"
