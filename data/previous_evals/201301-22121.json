   "comments": [
    "Not unless you're an econ major",
    "It's required for the econ major.",
    "I took the course because it was required for my major, but it was far more manageable than Intermediate Microeconomics.",
    "Do not take this unless you have to. I've heard it's good with Nordhaus, but don't try your luck with anyone else.",
    "Prof. L'Hullier was a visiting professor, so I don't know if he'll be back. This class was well-taught, though. Not too much work, either.",
    "Intermediate Macro Econ.If you lack a soul and major in Econ, you'll need to take this course, so, sorry. If you're trying to decide whether to do this course just for kicks, don't. There's better stuff out there.",
    "if you have to take it, you'll be fine. otherwise, not worth your time",
    "Necessary and only marginally painful to get through.",
    "It's a required class. Take it with Nordhaus.",
    "It was nice have a visiting professor to mix things up, but that made things kind of unpredictable in terms of the tests\/grade\/what to expect. The final was pretty hard.",
    "Good background for macro",
    "The class is very similar to Intro Macro. It's a good refresher, but is not life changing. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an Econ major, you have to take it. If not, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother.",
    "Macro is essential to learning economics but the course was basically a repeat of intro macro with a few additional examples. No one came to class and the highlight of the semesters were the two guest lectures. Other than that, just read the book.",
    "No.",
    "Obviously only take if you're an Econ major",
    "You are probably going to take this class to fulfill core requirements for a major, but its definitely enjoyable and helps you understand economic policy over the last few years which has been a major topic of interest",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "If it is taught like it was this semester, do not take it. But a new professor is en route, so who knows.",
    "A good course as far as macro goes, but then again, it IS macro. Macroeconomics in its present state is a mind-numbing jumble of oft-contradictory models that ignore most variables in the economy, but look pretty on paper (or not so pretty, your call). While it's important to understand how the economy as a whole works, it might not be something that's worth taking this class for, especially since the emphasis was on theory (still more applied than Econ 126, I'm sure). If you're an econ major, you know exactly what you're doing there. If not, that's OK--it's not very time-consuming, at least. Jean-Paul had a quirky sense of humor and spectacular hair, but was difficult to follow at times (and very slow). But since he was a visiting professor, his teaching and looks should bear little on your decision to take this class.",
    "I would only take this class if it is required. I learned very little new material from intro macro so I would recommend taking a different econ class if you can!",
    "I believe most people looking to take this course are economics major who have to take it to complete the department requirements. This version of the course had a very reasonable work load, and the textbook we used was great (which can't be said about many other economics courses here). If you're not intending on majoring in Economics, I would suggest not taking the course. You don't learn much beyond what you learned in Introductory Macroeconomics; you're just expected to learn some of the math behind what was taught at the introductory level.",
    "There is literally no reason to take this class unless it's required for your major. You will learn nothing new that wasn't taught (more effectively) in intro macro. This class was a waste of my time and I wish I had been able to take it with a different professor. My one piece of advice is to make a study group where you take turns going to class, because random things from class are on the exams, but otherwise it's not worth going. And read the textbook.",
    "JEAN PAUL L'HUILLIER!!!",
    "I would recommend this class because I believe an understanding of macroeconomics is crucial to responsible citizenship. This course was well taught, had fair PSets and exams, and was informative.",
    "I thought Intermediate Macro felt like Into Macro in many ways but personally, having not taken Into in over a year, it was good to take this class as a refresher of many things. I thought that we should have spent more time on the later chapters, however, when the material got trickier.",
    "This class is very similar to intro Macro. You have to take it so be aware that the beginning of the class will be slow but it really picks up. Prof. L'Huillier is probably not your best option, but if you get Greg Phelan as your TA it won't matter. He will teach you all you need to know.",
    "A requirement. It was a pleasant experience for me. Probably one of the easy classes for my major, Econ& Math",
    "You have to take this class. That said, I probably made a poor choice taking it in the spring with this visiting professor. Although I hear mixed reviews about Nordhaus in the fall. So pick your poison.",
    "I would recommend this course even to non-econ majors.",
    "It's not what I expected. I have no idea if Jean Paul will be returning next year to teach this course, but if he does, any student who prefers a more understandable structure and straightforwardness should probably go with a regular Yale professor.",
    "This class is nothing like the regular intermediate macro taught at Yale so really I don't know what to say that might help people.",
    "Just hope that you don't have a class full of people where some actually demand that the class be harder, when they already know the material and it is new for everyone else.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. This course reaffirmed my decision to become an economics major. The subject matter was very interesting and it was taught in a very easy-to-understand manner. The Professor and TAs were fantastic and clearly cared a lot for their students. I came into this course with a very shaky understanding of macroeconomics but I now feel very comfortable taking higher-level coursework in the subject. I feel now that I have an adequate grasp of current and past economic events and I grasp the intimacies of the economy more deeply. The Professor and TAs made themselves very available outside of class and gave informative feedback. The grading was fair and, if you put in the work, you will be able to achieve great grades.",
    "In terms of content, it's almost identical to intro macro, but the problems can get trickier.",
    "This is an amazing class. Choose wisely while deciding which semester you take it.",
    "This course has the potential to be extremely interesting and engaging. However, the course did not move much beyond the introductory material. Take this course if you need it as a requirement, otherwise you would learn more by spending the time you would invest in this course reading the newspaper for analysis and understanding of macroeconomic events."
