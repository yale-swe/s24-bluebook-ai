    "On the surface this course is about the rising field of political ecology and several case studies that highlight a political ecology approach. But more fundamentally, it teaches you a new way to think. Science, society, and knowledge itself all take on a different meaning after this class- I now have a critical eye towards everything about the environment that I once took for granted, including the tragedy of the commons, the dangers of population growth, and the value of national parks.",
    "I learned to reconsider EVERYTHING I thought I knew about environmental policy. I learned the value of discourse analysis and deconstructing common narratives that we don't even realize that we buy into. This class changed the way I will approach everything in my life from now on.",
    "Political Ecology taught me SO much about the systems and power dynamics behind socio-environmental issues and generally the world at large. This class really opened my eyes to how everything is political, and how power, control over land, and control over people are really central to so many diverse issues across the world. I feel well-equipped by this class to examine social and environmental issues through the lens and philosophy of Political Ecology. I feel confident that I will be able to apply the analytical skills I learned in this class to deconstruct such issues and understand their root causes.",

    "Strengths: Overall fantastic course. I had my doubts about student-led discussion but it actually worked out so well, with all of us becoming close with each other as we grappled with our own westernized preconceptions of everything. Readings, though dense, were well chosen and interesting. The mini lectures helped digest the Robbins material. Food was much appreciated every week. Weaknesses: This course had no true weaknesses but there were a few things worth consideration. More mini lectures might have helped understand the theory behind political ecology a bit more- the ones we had helped considerably. I would have loved to have one or two planned discussions about taking a political ecology approach to current issues like like the climate change debate (for example during the last lecture, which was pretty open ended). This would have made what was a very challenging and confusing learning experience more immmediately applicable.",
    "This course involved a level of engagement not typically required in a yale class. Professor Doolittle holds all of her students to a high standard that requires each person to actively contribute to every seminar. Professor Doolittle does little to contribute to the class discussion, which I first saw as a weakness but later came to appreciate.",
    "This class has so many strengths that I think its only weakness was being too short to get through all of the material we wanted to discuss! The foremost strengths of this class are Professor Doolittle and the students in the class. Because it is really a student-led, discussion-based class, the students make this class, and our group was fantastic this year. It was a win-win (which so infrequently happen in PE!) that we had a small group of students who were all talkative, thoughtful, and dedicated to the class. Although she does not take a leading role in the class (which I really appreciated), when she contributes, Professor Doolittle enriches conversation with her both field-based knowledge and personal wisdom. The readings for this class were so interesting and I rarely felt bored by them. In addition, although sometimes a stress, the weekly response essays ensured that I was very prepared well ahead of class, something I came to really appreciate."

    "Though heavy on reading and writing, this was without a doubt my favorite class at Yale. On the surface this course is about the rising field of political ecology and several case studies that highlight a political ecology approach. But more fundamentally, it teaches you a new way to think. Science, society, and knowledge itself all take on a different meaning after this class- I now have a critical eye towards everything about the environment that I once took for granted, including the tragedy of the commons, the dangers of population growth, and the value of national parks. I had my doubts about student-led discussion but it actually worked out really well, with all of us becoming close with each other as we grappled with our own westernized preconceptions of everything. Professor Doolittle is fantastic, and you end up with the impression that she is far wiser than most of the other EVST faculty. Overall, it is hard to imagine how many people graduate Yale with a degree in environmental studies without knowing this stuff. Seriously, if you get the chance, take it. The world needs more people who understand poltical ecology.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I believe that this class should be mandatory for any environmental studies major or anyone interested in international policy or governance. This course will challenge you to consider everything you thought you knew about how we manage our environment. Professor Doolittle is a remarkable person, and you should definitely take this class just to get to know her. There is definitely a lot of reading, but every reading is interesting and relevant and soon enough if won't even feel like your doing that much work for the class. This was hands down THE BEST seminar I've ever taken, and you are missing out if you don't enroll ASAP!",
    "Political Ecology is one of the all-time best classes I've ever taken. It's one of those classes you take and then end up believing everyone should take. I learned so much not just about socio-environmental issues, but also broadly about the way power and control of people manifest in issues all over the world - a vital topic no matter your field of study. I cannot recommend this class highly enough - it is SO interesting (I was never bored by material), Professor Doolittle is awesome, and it will fundamentally change the way you think about the world. However, Political Ecology also isn't a class where you can get by without giving your all. The weekly reading response essays ensure that everyone engages deeply with the material before class. However, this also makes section really enjoyable because it ensures that everyone participates significantly in class and has time\/room to digest and learn the material. Additionally, class time is very much a student-led discussion, so I'd recommend shopping the section before deciding because the people in your class will make or break your experience.",
    "Yes, the topic of interest is important for people in any field to understand and think about."
