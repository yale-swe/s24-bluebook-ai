    "I would recommend it to someone who is interested in Chinese history. It is a good course for someone who has learned something in their previous education about China and want to deepen their knowledge. For those who have not studied any Chinese history before, this class may still be helpful, as we also studied from a book by Bergere, that served a bit as the class' \"textbook\" even though it was not just that. It is also a good course for those interested in studying a city. You will benefit a lot.",
    "If you're prepared to do a lot of reading and are excited by the development of a city, this is a class for you. Even if this is not you, there are a lot of benefits in taking a class that is outside of your usual interests; even more so in the format of a freshman seminar.",
    "Shanghai is a great course that traces the history of Shanghai from concession era to its modern era. Not only do you learn about the history of the city, the course also emphasizes critical reading of historical texts. Each week, you get assigned reading (At the beginning of the year it would take around 3-4~ hours to complete all the readings) and you discuss them in class. On average, every other week you get assigned a 1-2 page paper. Although these papers sound short, they actually take a lot more time (more time that having 2 big papers due). Professor Ho is not always clear on what they should be about or what kind of format they should be. Overall, I would recommend this course to any freshman interested in history. Chinese history is very unrepresented in high school and college, but it is so complex. This course has sparked my interest in East Asian studies. Although it is very difficult at the beginning, the readings become a lot easier. You get to bond with the others in the course and learn a lot.",
    "If you are interested in China or history in general, I would highly recommend this course! It would give you a very comprehensive but unique understanding of Chinese history and Shanghai, and you will also learn about the scholarly methods used in the field of history. The readings are really interesting, the writing assignments are very thought-provoking, and the occasional special classes\/events are absolutely fascinating (they also come with good food!). We had professors who wrote the readings visit our class, and we were able to discuss about the article with them directly. It was the coolest thing ever!! Professor Ho is really awesome, and I am so grateful that I got to know her.",
    "This class has both a benefit and detriment of being a constant pressure on you all semester long. This class exposes you to academic writing very quickly. You will get an in-depth view of a city and will be responding a pretty closed group of scholars. The 6\/8 essays and six quotes structure gives you constant pressure because every week or 2 weeks you will end up writing a short essay. Although the essays are short they can be a pain to perfect, since there is a strict two page limit. However, once you get the essays out of the way the class becomes a breeze. The 6 quotes diary may be annoying at first but it gives you a way to keep track of the readings and helps with in-class discussions. Professor Ho is very knowledgeable and approachable, so when you have questions\/concerns, don't be scared to talk to her. Be sure to ask her questions on the subject matter when you're confused. Since this class is in 'seminar' format, you'll be bouncing ideas off classmates and talking to them more than you will to her -- she just plays the role of moderator. This can get challenging when no one knows the topic very well, or if the journals being read are too obtuse. The best way to fix this would be to ask her questions in class because chances are everyone else is just as confused. You'll notice that when she does give answers, they are very detailed, thorough, and will definitely help you to understand the readings. It might be challenging to speak in class but it's not too bad. This is one of the better classes to take as a freshman. No final, no project, and no midterm?! This class may be an annoyance but if you're interested in the subject its rewards are many.",
    "The course was an urban history class that used Shanghai to understand the issues of China, imperialism, demographic change, and politcs.",
    "I would recommend HIST 032 01 to a fellow student if they were interested in Chinese history and improving their short essay writing abilities. I feel that I have learned an immense amount about Shanghai and in the process got the opportunity to write a lot of short pieces on the history.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class! It was very different from any other class I took this semester. I would summarize it as a great course for learning more about China and how it changed through the years by focusing on the changes of Shanghai."
