    "This couse was a fantastic opportunity to develop my sense of what I value in poetry--not a checklist, but rather a deeper awareness of how stylistically and thematically diverse works might please me in different ways, which then informed my own writing and revision process.",
    "analyzing poetry and developing my own creative writing skills",
    "I just improved as a writer and reader of poetry. Also at taking, and picking and choosing with criticism.",
    "This course dramatically improved my poetry writing. It made me better at revising my work as well. I found that the writing skills I gained in this poetry class transferred into other settings. It made me a better reader and writer of essays and prose.",
    "It was wonderful to be able to pour myself into reading and writing poetry each week and receive thoughtful feedback from Louise and the other students in the class. Louise's insightful comments and devotion to constantly meeting with students and reading revisions was invaluable - I am so thankful for it.",
    "I developed a keener eye for reading and critiquing poetry and a broader fluency with contemporary poetry. My own writing improved and should continue to improve going forward, so long as I keep at it and continue to hear Louise's voice in the back of my head when I write. Plus one gets the chance to work with her, a fantastic and honest teacher of writing who genuinely cares about her students.",
    "I became a much better writer",
    "I developed not only strengthened and sharpened poetics but honed my ability to evaluate my own work. Because Louise held me to higher standards, I began to hold myself to these standards as well. That is a true and lifelong gift."

   "comments": [
    "It is an honor to study with Louise, and to get so many comments and so much conference time with such a wonderful, talented, thoughtful artist. She is the highlight and the clear reason to take this class - for her, I recommend it. There are many things that I've found frustrating about this course. We read a book a week and never once discuss it. The class is always the same exact format of 3 student critiques, which can sometimes get tired, and often the last one ends up with very little time. People suck up to Louise a lot. So there are flaws, for sure. But Louise is so wise and dedicated and amazing - it's certainly worth it.",
    "Louise Gluck's feedback on my writing was a huge strength. Meeting with her one-on-one was extremely helpful and getting her written comments back was too. The workshop seemed less productive at times. People often tried to say something \"smart\" rather than helpful for the writer.",
    "It ended up being quite a bit more work than I had anticipated. But I think I could have spent more time focusing on writing my own poetry if perhaps the reading load was lessened. Maybe it could be 1 book and 1 response every two weeks, instead of each week?",
    "The design of the course is simple: write a poem each week and use the class time to workshop. I think that worked very well",
    "The workshop model of this class creates a truly rare dynamic in which students are engaged in and learn from each other's work. The opportunity to work closely with Louise Gluck and to get individualized feedback from her each week is truly a gift."

   "comments": [
    "For serious readers (and especially writers) of verse: yes.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are looking to improve your poetry writing. Louise is an excellent instructor, especially if you meet with her one-on-one.",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic -- Louise is such a thoughtful, invested professor who cares so much about her students. It was so wonderful to be able to read and write poetry every week, engage with a group of amazing poets in workshop, and work with someone as insightful and devoted as Louise. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course.",
    "Definitelytake it if you get the chance. Your writing will improve and working with Louise is a joy and a privilege. She doesn't sugarcoat things, but she genuinely loves her students and loves working with you to improve your work. She's a great teacher of poetry. The class is work though: a poem a week plus a single-spaced page reading response about a book of contemporary poetry (of your choice) each week. Overall certainly worth the work.",
    "If you're seriously looking to improve your poetry then this is the class to take",
    "I recommend this course to students who are serious about poetry and want to engage seriously in the project of honing their craft.",
    "Take it, if you get in. This class pushed my writing, and although a poem a week got hard, the work for this class never felt like work. One poemand a poetry \"book review\" due every week and then a workshop of three poems per week. She pushes everyone to talk, so don't think you can sit there and not contribute. You'll get three poems workshopped more or less, but the weekly comments are always extremely insightful. There's nothing like getting praise from Gluck. Sign up for conference early, because she gets booked up quickly.",
    "Louise is brilliant, and the feedback you get on your work is always sharp and thoughtful. If you put in the effort to write poems you're excited about, and meet with her one on one in office hours, you'll get a lot out of the class. If you don't schedule meetings with her you'll still write a poem a week and read a collection of poetry a week, but I've found that the most useful part of the class is sitting down and discussing my work with Louise. If you don't have the time to fully commit yourself, don't take this class. Similarly, if you have a thin skin, don't take this class. But if you can take heavy criticism and make time for office hours you'll grow immensely as a writer."
