    "Definitely recommend. I would recommend any course with Carby.",
    "I recommend it if the student wants to get to know the faculty and be able to engage readings outside of their general area of study. It's much more work than the American Studies equivalent, but is a better use of your time for sure."

   "comments": [
    "Very important course.",
    "As noted above, the breadth of Yale's faculty in African American Studies permitted a greater engagement with contemporary currents in the field. As an introduction to the department, it is an indispensable course. However, sans an engagement with foundational texts in the field, while often accompanied by unfortunately normative politics of gender and sexuality, nonetheless limits the possibilities for conversation and dialogue across the respective interests and background of the enrolled students.",
    "Again, it's great to meet the faculty and their visits for the most part \"humanize\" them as well. Perhaps if they presented more works-in-progress that would help, because then we would see unpolished work and more recent\/current work, because faculty seem most likely to work with you if what you're doing is more in line w\/ their current interests, not something they wrote several years ago."
