    "The class teaches you both how to critically evaluate as well as present the literature to one another. I'd definitely recommend it, since it teaches you things that are very important for grad students to know.",

   "comments": [
    "The class taught me about areas of research I didn't know much about previously, and also gave me a lot of practice with putting together presentations and reading papers, which are both necessary things to know.",
    "This course gave me morepractice on reading and critically analyzing primary literature.",
    "Reading primary literature and being able to present are two skills that will be used throughout my research and this class helped with both. I learned some about stem cell differentiation, hematopoesis, cancer, and reactive oxygen species, but overall the skill set gained from this course was more useful to me since I most likely will not be working in most of these areas."
