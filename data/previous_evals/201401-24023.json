Too much responsibility was placed on students, who are relatively unfamiliar with the material, to teach and lead discussions. A better balance would have been for Professor Cashore to lecture for half of the class and have students lead discussion for the second half.",
    "It was great that everyone got the opportunity to lead a class and sometimes the discussion was productive, but often it felt like we'd get trapped going around in circles until Ben or Stefan redirected us. Maybe splitting the class into professor-led and student-led discussion parts would help mitigate that."
