   "comments": [
    "The course is divided into four modules: China's one-child policy, common property resource management theory, the Maine Lobster Fishery, and international climate policy. Readings on the topics each week and discussion. One final term paper.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "PLSC 212 was a great course--Professor Fotos is awesome and the people in the seminar were all very passionate about the course topic. The course was overall well structured and I especially enjoyed the student-led seminars at the end of the semester. I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in environmental policy management (it was HEAVY on policy analysis). You have to make sure you pace yourself throughout the semester--the main focus of the class is to write a final paper on a topic of your choice and the class readings are meant to help your prepare for the paper. The only weakness of the course was that there was no way of knowing how we were doing in the class. Although we turned in outlines, drafts, and peer reviews, we were not given any grades for these assignments.",
    "This class was incredible. Professor Fotos really organized it well and it got me thinking about environmental issues in a fundamentally different way. It doesn't go much into the nitty gritty of climate change, but it gives you the tools to be able to analyze any policy or governance structure critically. The readings were really interesting (and not too much of it) and there was a great balance between theory and practice. Professor Fotos cares a lot about his students and it really showed. If you are thinking about environmental policy at all, you must take this class.",
    "Good course, although if you know little about \"sustainability issues\" prior to taking the course, you may struggle to keep up. Fotos is awesome.",
    "This class is great for anyone who is really into thefield of political science, both for policy creation and political theory. We explored the roadblocks as well as alternative paths to creating effective policy, spending a lot of time on lobster fisheries, as well as the Kyoto Protocol, cap and trade, and the Waxman-Markey Bill. Most of the work is reading, although there is end of class presentation and a final paper. I would recommend working with Prof. Fotos on the paper as early as possible, not because it's terribly difficult but because he's very helpful and wants you to really think about these issues.",
    "Take it if you are ready to be challenged; don't take it if you are looking for an easy A."
