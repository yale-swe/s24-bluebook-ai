   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for an intro to international relations theory because you can look at a specific case in point and determine whether or not the theory is applicable",
    "The work is heavy but if you have any interest in Iran, the nuclear issue, the Middle East, or IR theory, it is so worth it. The professor is delightful and the course itself is intense and worthwhile.",
    "This is a great class - the professor is amazing, the readings are fascinating, and even if you don't do them, you will learn a LOT about Iranian foreign policy and IR theory. Some people do get frustrated with the IR theory but it's honestly interesting even though its not applicable most of the time. The field trips are also a treat. I completely recommend this course to anyone interested in Iran or the Middle East.",
    "Definitely recommend. Excellent course, not only because of the current situation with Iran, but in general. Professor Terhalle is excellent: good areas covered, good discussions, great feedback, and wonderful opportunities to meet and talk with Iranian diplomats. Couldn't have been better.",
    "PLSC 124 is a great class. If you can get in, take it. You discuss contemporary issues in Iran's International Relations and then get to discuss these issues with high ranking members of the Iranian embassy to the UN. Our class, along with other students, was even able to go to a question and answer session with President Ahmadinejad. While these sessions were often frustrating, they were incredibly insightful as far as Iranian foreign policy is concerned. Highly recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend it."
