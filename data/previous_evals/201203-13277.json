   "comments": [
    "Journalism with Brill exposes you to multiple types of long-form writing, as well as to Brill's personality and wealth of personal journalism experience. You write a 2000 word profile of a classmate early on in the term (which is a little awkward since so much of the class already knows each other, but Brill wants you to develop a thicker skin during the course) and a 3500 word magazine article. Both are pretty fun, and it's nice to report for class credit. Reading is pretty minimal and mostly fun examples of good journalism. If you're a YDN person, this is totally doable the year you do board. Brill can be harsh at times, but will provide as much individualized feedback as you want, especially if you want to go into journalism professionally. Class discussions can get boring, so really only take this if you want to do the assignments \/ get to know him.",
    "English 467 01 does not require a ton of work, but requires that the work produced be of the highest quality.Great prep class for journalists! Best to be taken as a sophomore or junior.",
    "Yes to those who are interested in becoming reporters. He will definitely improve your reporting, though. If you are looking for a writing class, look elsewhere; the only thing Brill will do for your writing is make it more (much more) economical.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone serious about journalism. You will get out of this course as much as you put into it.",
    "Take it. Brill is fabulous. He has incredible insight and experience in journalism - as both a journalist and a business man - and has an amazing network. The class taught me a lot about journalism and what it means to be a journalist - more than any other Yale course I've taken. It's also necessary if you want the Yale Journalism Certificate. Do the readings - they're interesting, you learn from them, and Brill will not be pleased if you don't read them - and complete the assignments ON TIME. Though I hoped to become a better writer after taking the course, I don't feel I did. That being said, I still learned a lot and absolutely recommend the class. It is one of the best clases I've taken at Yale and Brill is fantastic.",
    "Brill is terrifying. That said, his harsh critiques are helpful and truly do produce a better final product. If you're interested in journalism, I'd recommend taking the class since you meet a lot of cool journalists and Professor Brill has so many contacts, but do go into the class with thick skin. Be prepared to have your writing analyzed with a microscope.",
    "Yes I would recommend ENGL 467 to another student if they have any interest in journalism.",
    "Definitely one of the top five courses I've taken at Yale. Brill is brilliant. He will not coddle you, and he will not let b.s. pass as work--which is to say, he's a better teacher than most other teachers at Yale. It's intimidating at first but you get used to it, and you'll find that he really cares about his students. Take it.",
    "look over the syllabus very carefully, see that there is a lot of attention paid to the business of journalism. know that most of the semester will be about how to get sources to go on record. i mean, take it, but just know that stuff.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even though I'm a sophomore, I can say with certainty that, even as a senior, I'll still look back on Journalism as my favorite class at Yale. If you want a professor who will challenge you, make you a better journalist, and call you out when you're wrong (and you should), take this class. You'll take it with some of the brightest minds at Yale, and the profile assignment was a fun (if sometimes stressful) way to get to know everyone. Brill has so much real-world experience and practical advice that, if you're looking to journalismas a career, it's imperative to get to know him. And the best part: if you work hard, you'll be rewarded at the end.",
    "If you have any interest in pursuing a career in journalism, take this course. Brill can be tough and intimidating at times, but he knows his stuff and wants his students to succeed. He is well connected in the field, so he can give his students the opportunity to teleconference with Bob Woodward on the future of journalism or sit down for lunch with Gay Talese."
