   "comments": [
    "Great class that draws a great\/insightful group of students. Prepare to have your assumptions about everything challenged. Readings are broad and fascinating, class discussions don't ramble around like other Phil\/Psych classes I've taken because Knobe always makes sure there's structure\/direction. The papers are a great opportunity to explore your own ideas.",
    "Prepare to get confused by philosophers and by the class discussion when it spirals into nonsense as the class explores one particular objection etc. until it loses its meaning. Overall though, a good course. The first 2 days will give you an accurate picture of the rest of the semester, so test it out and go from there.",
    "Don't take this class. It was hard and I don't think I learned anything really. Professor Knobe is a difficult grader and not very helpful.",
    "This is an awesome class, especially for a psych or CogSci student who wants an introductory crash course in relevant topics in philosophy. It's a totally reasonable amount of work, and you learn a lot, particularly if it's your first shot at philosophy. Professor Knobe is great, and he does an awesome job both understanding and catering to the level of prior knowledge (or lack thereof) in the class and also showing the arc of how certain philosophical concepts have shaped the study of psychology. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "A relaxed seminar offering an overview of interesting topics in the field of philosophy and psychology; a balance between empirical studies and philosophical papers on subjects such as morality and free will.",
    "This class is great for people who are excited to take a philosophy class but may not have that much experience with the topic. Do not take this class if you are expecting more psych than philosophy or half an half. It is almost entirely philosophy, for people who have experience and background in psychology.",
    "TAKE IT (if you can get a spot). This is basically a philosophy course filled with psychology students, which is awesome because all the concepts are new to pretty much everyone, and the discussion is generally really engaging. Professor Knobe is legitimately one of my favorite professors I have had ever at Yale, and he was great at explaining some slightly esoteric philosophy concepts, and also is just a wonderful, entertaining person who legitimately cares about his students. This is a thought-provoking course without all that much work (the readings for each class are very manageable, plus 2 7-9 page papers and a final. The papers are a bit tough because they are very open-ended, but Professor Knobe will talk though them with you as much as you want. If you want a basic introduction to a lot of big, flashy philosophy topics, this is definitely a great class to take.",
    "Absolutely! Very enjoyable class. Nice mix of psychology and philosophy, good professor, and interesting material covered.",
    "This is a great seminar that introduces you to several key philosophical ideas, and then covers the recent and important psychological work that has been done in these areas. Highly recommend for anyone, especially those interested in the intersection of philosophy and psychology.",
    "If you're a cog sci\/psychology student with an interest but not a lot of background in philosophy, this class is right for you!",
    "If you like pondering free will, the self, the nature of the mind, and morality, then this course will give you good terminology to understand how to understand these issues. A benchmark in cognitive science. You'll be engaging in a lot of thinking, so get ready to immerse yourself in this highly complex realm!",
    "Incredibly interesting intro to current issues in experimental philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a cog sci or psyc major. It really marries a lot of different topics in the field of cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy into one interdisciplinary study. The readings can be difficult to trudge through and there were some points that I didn't completely understand and class discussion didn't always completely clear up things, but for the most part the reading is pretty manageable. I'd say the toughest part of class was the first half, especially if you were not exposed to philosophy before. I found the group discussion to move really quickly and I found it hard initially to contribute just because I'd never been exposed to philosophical discussion before."
