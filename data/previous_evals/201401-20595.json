    "French 140 is a seminar French class. We read two full texts, stories from the Diversit\u00e9 anthology, and watched three films. I would recommend this class for any student who wants to continue to improve their French.",
    "I would suggest French 140 to another student. I feel as though my ability to carry a conversation in French increased, and I definitely feel more comfortable reading a more dense book in another language.",
    "Read some great French novels, watch movies, perfect your grammar, present for 15 minutes, and learn about World War II. I would definitely recommend this course because it is very invested in its students' learning and improvement over the term.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You make a lot of headway with both your written and spoken french, and the biggest transformation is your reading comprehension. There's a lot of reading, and most of it is pretty engaging, so you become much more comfortable with the idea of picking up and reading a french book. The final unit, on WWII, was fascinating and the readings\/movies were great and helped to put our language understanding in a cultural context. Great class, and Mme Burton was an amazing professor! Take it with her, because France during WWII is her specialty and she knows and loves the material.",
    "French 140 felt very much like a continuation of L3, it covered more advanced grammar concepts with short stories and readings. I really enjoyed the WWII unit that includes a novel, films, and presentations. It is a fine course to take if you're fulfilling your language requirement."
