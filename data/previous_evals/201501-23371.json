I spent at least 24 hours or more total working on the final grant proposal project, though this can be spread out throughout the semester. When giving a presentation",

    "The course was very informative.",
    "This was a small and flexible course, and the instructors did a good job of tailoring the course to suit the needs and interests of students. They were able to bring in some really good speakers, and the use of primary literature enhanced the course.",
    "I really enjoyed all the lectures given by Brian and Serap. I thought the quality of the guest lecturers was varied but overall was weaker.",
    "The professors are very conscientious of the fact that students have other courses with other work. They are supportive and flexible, and their primary interest is to help people learn about the topic.",
    "I thought on the whole the class was great. I would have preferred a few less guest speakers, but did enjoy most of the guest speakers who came. I learned a lot from this class, and there was a great and balanced range of topics covered. The final grant proposal project was a good learning tool, as I will definitely have to write more of them in my future! Overall, I'm glad I took this course.",
    "The material in the course was interesting and the professors are incredibly nice. I enjoyed the guest speakers and learning about their different backgrounds in studying vector-borne disease. However the expectations for the course were unclear - no direct guidelines in the syllabus for major assignments, and the grading paradigm was also unclear. Getting feedback on assignments also either took too long or did not happen.",
    "I enjoyed the course overall and think the instructors are fantastic. I would have liked to be \"talked at\" less (more hands-on work and less powerpoint-style learning)."

    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Brian was phenomenal. Super on top of everything, very understanding, very approachable and probably one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale - he made it interesting but didn't dumb it down. Brian was great :)",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0He was very engaging and put a lot of effort into making sure this course was aligned with student interests.",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0See above",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Brian is very responsive, supportive, and clear as an instructor. He encourages people to pursue their interests within the course and to ask any and all questions.",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0I also think Brian is a fantastic teacher. I really enjoyed the lectures he gave; he was very responsive to student needs and always willing to help out\/give feedback.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Serap was amazing and super approachable and encouraging to all of us !",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0She was approachable and did a good job presenting lectures on her areas of expertise.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Serap and Brian are both great lecturers and very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Given that most of the lectures were guest speakers, it is hard to qualify the strengths and weaknesses of each instructor's teaching. That being said, Professor Aksoy has a wealth of knowledge and is good at engaging the class with questions that make us look deeper into the problem\/research being discussed.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Serap is so knowledgeable and is a fantastic instructor. She is inquisitive and prompts us to think deeper into each topic discussed."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has exciting topics and teachers that actually care about you. It was great",
    "This course is a primary literature-based course on insect disease vectors and experimental techniques used to investigate related issues. It's a small, intimate course with passionate instructors. I would recommend it to students interested in vector-borne disease and how the biology of these vectors can inform the control of these diseases.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Coming from outside of YSPH (I came from FES), I was concerned that this course might be too far out of my comfort zone. I am interested in vector-borne diseases in relation to climate change, but my background in the biology of insect disease vectors was very limited. It was a bit of a challenge at first but the instructors were very supportive and the course load is not at all a problem (for native English speakers) once you get a handle on the technical jargon. Overall it was an interesting course without too much of a work commitment, so it is good if you are looking for a casual overview of research on insect disease vector biology.",
    "This class is a great overview of a wide range of vector biology topics, and I definitely learned a lot. They covered a wide range of hot topics, including host-vector immune response, microbiome of vectors, resistance to insecticides, global warming and its impact on vector range. Basically a really great class on vector borne diseases, in both the old and new world, and covering a wide range of diseases.",
    "Great for interested students without a background in vector-borne disease - good variety of material and with instructors who are active in the field.",
    "I thought it was a great course, but again, I would prefer less powerpoint-style learning. The discussion sections could be changed into more of a \"journal group\" where students sit around and collaboratively discuss a paper, rather than having one student present a powerpoint. It just gets boring being talked at for an hour and a half on one day, and then again for an hour the next day. I really liked the dissections and other hands-on activities we did during a few discussion sections and I think more discussion sections should be used to do this sort of thing."
