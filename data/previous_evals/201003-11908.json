    "I really don't like this senior essay process. I think history should, like other majors, give its students the option of completing the senior essay in a seminar setting instead of forcing an independent study. We have never had to do an independent study before, and it feels overwhelming and it also less intellectually-engaging because you don't have the constant opportunities for topical dialogue that a seminar provides. I don't object to the length of the senior essay (either in pages or in terms of being year-long), but I don't like its forced independence and would urge the history major to consider senior seminars for subsequent classes. Without providing opportunities for dialogue, it is too easy for students to skim through the entire first semester just whipping off the assignments last-minute without truly thinking through them or caring about them.",
    "You are required to sign up for HIST 495 to write the senior essay. You don't actually \"go to class.\" You fulfill a series of deadlines (choosing an essay topic, compiling a bibliography, preparing an outline, etc.) while meeting with your advisor as often as you like. It's low-stress in the fall semester, but I would highly recommend choosing a topic as soon as possible and not procrastinating so you can get a head start on your essay.",
    "Need to take it.",
    "Yes, because you're required to take it.",
    "Sure",
    "If you're a History Major, you have no choice. Have fun!",
    "You're pretty much stuck. Sorry.",
    "Not the most fun, but all history majors have to do it.",
    "The first term of working on the history senior thesis. You need to have written ten pages by the end of the term, but otherwise there aren't that many assignments.",
    "It's the senior essay. First semester = research (don't overlook the travel grant, it's essential), second semester = writing (don't worry about how good your prose is at first, it'll probably be bad, but that's just how it works).",
    "It's the Senior Essay...",
    "Senior Essay!",
    "pointless. you have to take it if you're a senior history major.",
    "Sure? Not like we really have a choice anyway. But the pacing is helpful.",
    "You have no choice if you are history major...",
    "You're a history major, you have to take it.",
    "Yep - it is mandatory.",
    "N\/A",
    "for a history major - definitely!",
    "If you are planning on becoming a history major, a two semester senior essay is mandatory. Make sure to pick a topic and adviser that you love because you will be spending a lot of time on this paper. Senior essays are highly rewarding upon completion, and I think all Yale students should write one!",
    "The history senior essay is required for all majors, and it's a pretty solid research burden that definitely takes both semesters to complete. All I can say is the same thing that everyone else says but that no one listens to: start early and don't put it off.",
    "I would recommend it if you're a senior history major and you would like to graduate. I also happen to think it's a great requirement. Study a topic in which the actors are still living if you can! Traveling to interview subjects is quite an experience. Pick a great advisor--not just a great scholar to advise you.",
    "The Senior Essay, as you might expect, is what you make of it. Be sure to pick a topic that truly interests you - think of it as a year-long independent study on a topic of your choice, with a professor of your choice. If you think of it like this, you are bound to enjoy the experience. My advisor, Prof. Adam Tooze, has been exceptional. The project is worth it just to be able to learn from him."
