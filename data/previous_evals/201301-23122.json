    "Don't be intimidated by the large course demand at the first couple class meetings. a class every yalie should be required to take.",
    "This class was a really fun chance to think in a different way. I had never taken an art class at Yale before this one, and I highly recommend it. At times, I found myself a bit bored, but other times I couldn't wait to get to class. Robert Storr is clearly a very talented artist. As a Professor, he is pretty inconsistent, but it was interesting to see the way an artistic mind works. I wish I got more feedback on how I could improve my technical skills from class to class. Having absolutely no homework and no final project except a critique was awesome. Make sure to save ALL of your drawings!",
    "Basic Drawing with Rob Storr is absolutely wonderful. There was practically no work outside of class, and in class we did mostly figure drawing.",
    "Yes! This is a relaxing class with very minimal work. All you have to do is go to class - no homework.",
    "Take it! Very chill Basic Drawing class, your drawing will definitely improve, and Rob Storr is super knowledgeable and has lots of fascinating anecdotes to tell you.",
    "Definitely take it if you want a basic introduction to art, just be prepared for the 2 two hour sessions every week, but no outside homework ever!",
    "Great class. Great professor.Rob is wonderfully knowledgeable, knows many of the artists he mentions personally and will bring in fun anectdotes, and he is keen on giving everyone not just instruction on drawing, but also some art history context for everything we do.Learned a lot, though it was more of a figure drawing class than a basic drawing class!",
    "Do it! Storr is so good and it's really relaxing."
