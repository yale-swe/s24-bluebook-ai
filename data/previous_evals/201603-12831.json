    "The course showcases the research that fellow grad students are doing but fails to teach anything. Something more interactive, like a once-a-year department 5 min talk (like during orientation) would be much more fun and beneficial. Speaking is useful but since there is no discussion or comments on the speakers, the audience cannot engage or learn throughout the course. A talk followed by class discussion would be more beneficial. Lastly, having the course occur every week is incredibly exhausting. Very quickly, interest is lost, students become less engaged, and the course proves to be more wasteful than beneficial. Keep the activity (talks to fellow grad students) infrequent and more engaging. Students will learn better this way."
