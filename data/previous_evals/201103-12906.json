    "It is an interesting class if you are looking to learn more about Black Women's history, however at times it is incredibly depressing.",
    "I would say that this course is exactly what it says it is, a historical look at African American women. It is very interesting and you will learn so much about how African American women have evolved from the times of slavery to the current day. The texts are engaging but they can be quite lengthy if you do not get a head-start. There are no breaks, there is a novel or multiple articles, or both to read every week and you will be expected to write a short response for each week. However, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the material, especially men; you might learn something about history and yourself. Also, all races can and should certainly take this course.",
    "every yale undergrad should take this class!",
    "If you're a WGSS major, an Af-Am Studies major, a History major, or an American Studies major, it's a really solid class to take. Prof. Feimster, though her lectures sometimes wandered a little, is a real gem, and while I'm sure this varies fromyear to year, we had wonderful TAs who really enriched the experience both during lecture and in section. I think the biggest strength of the class is its reading list--while a little heavy (basically a book a week), it really could not be a better collection of readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. This class provides a look at history that no other class at Yale provides. In my personal opinion it should be a requirement for all history majors and WGSS students. Every day I learned something that I didn't already know, and more importantly I came to understand the foundations of racist and sexist thoughts around black women in the United State that still exist today.",
    "As mentioned in the first question, it's a wonderful class that I wish everyone took. I've taken all sorts of Yale history classes and nothing covers black women's lives like this (or sadly, at all). Most other classes at Yale (including in the WGSS department) treat black women's history as an afterthought and it always remains on the periphery. This is a class that really takes the time to look at as many aspects of how black women have lived in America since slavery and what patterns continue to crop up, what changes, and what those experiences say about American life as a whole (especially what it says about how we define and treat citizens, what the country allows, what it values, and how we determine what counts as history). You'll learn a lot about the major social movements (feminism, Civil Rights, Black Power, worker's rights) and their actors, as well as things about American popular culture, health care, reproductive rights, notions of liberty, and labor."
