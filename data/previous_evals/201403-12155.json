   "comments": [
    "I think this is a really great class. I feel like I'm leaving it with a pretty deep grasp of Virgilian language and Virgilian style, particularly in connections with sections of the Aeneid that didn't feel that accessible to me before, because they were so dense. It's also a well-organized class; it felt like a really sensible workload to me and I really appreciated the exercise of having a midterm paper with hyper-specific questions. I didn't think class discussions were that good, mostly because it was hard to balance focus on the language with focus on the literary aspects of the text but I'm not sure that's through anyone's fault. If for no other reason, take it because Professor Peirano is fantastic--so so brilliant, but also so simultaneously invested in making this material feel accessible and taking seriously students' ideas.",
    "This class has a ton of work. I mean, a ton. It gets very frustrating sometimes, and there will be many a moment when you think to yourself: this amount of work is definitely unreasonable, and detrimental to my sanity. Especially when you might also find the discussions in class to lack imagination and uninteresting. If you are to compare, say, a DS section on Virgil with a section in this class, you might easily find the former more fulfilling and engaging, if engagement in meaningful literary discussions is your sort of thing. That said, this is still a good class to hone your Latin skills, and the amount of work definitely helps a lot with improving your command over the language. Also, if the class lets down sometimes, Virgil never does. Just know what you are signing up for.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in studying the Aeneid. The translation outside of class if a lot of work, however, so the student would really have to be genuinely interested in analyzing the Aeneid further.",
    "This was one of the best classes I took this semester. It was difficult, and there was a lot of reading (individual assignments were sometimes up to 150 lines a night) but I got so much out of it. Professor Peirano is wonderful and extremely understanding. If you like Latin and are prepared for hard work, especially if you have taken AP Latin (although be aware that this is not the same as your previous with Vergil), definitely take this course.",
    "This class was a lot of work, but if you are willing to put in the effort there are, I believe, huge payoffs for the Latin reader. My grammar skills and vocabulary retention progressed greatly over the course of this class.",
    "From what I can tell, this class largely delivered on its promises. If you are interested in Virgil you should take it! Since this course covers the final four books, you'll probably doing material you're less familiar with, rather than reprising high school\/AP Latin. I also really liked the supplementary readings, which often incorporated by literary theory in very interesting ways."
