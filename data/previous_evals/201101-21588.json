    "Literature 467 is a fascinating, unconventional literature seminar. It doesn't follow a linear trajectory, but instead begins with a consideration of analytic models developed from the works of Walter Benjamin and then continues on to apply them in various ways to a variety of interconnected, segmented works. The interconnection of ideas in the course, across and among these works, is mirrored in each work internally. It's a multi-faceted and interdisciplinary approach, touching also on math, music theory, and visual art. I think the course is relevant to developing models and systems in any area of study, and I would highly recommend it.",
    "Shop it and you'll know. It's a feeling. Howard Stern is incredible, experimental, brilliant. The works you explore are really interesting, too.",
    "The reading list is superb. The class has great potential for a comparative literature seminar, and maybe even as a lecture series, but in its current manifestation was a disappointment. Stern talks too much and students when they do speak, don\u0092t speak to each other.I did some of my greatest thinking during the 2.5 hours I spent in that classroom, but it was almost all due to the quality of the writing, and the fact I was not otherwise asked to be engaged, rather than what was going on around me.",
    "This is basically a free-form discussion twice a week about labyrinthine texts. We talked about literary theory, math, music, variation, architecture, concrete poetry, and a bunch of other topics that all somehow fit in with the course. We read one book per week, though the lengths varied quite a bit. The only assignment is a final paper or project, which you discuss with Professor Stern and can basically design to fit your interests. If you are interested in labyrinths, complex literature, or just crazy discussions with smart students and a smart professor, you should shop this class.",
    "Erudite.",
    "The texts we read are great. Professor Stern can talk on most things for hours on end and be interesting and quite funny. However, I left every class confused about what counts as good literary criticism and what counts as BS. Maybe that's a good thing. I don't know. Shop this class -- you will find it intriguing at the very least -- then decide. I'm glad I took the class.",
    "Definitely. A somewhat relaxed class that covers an array of great texts with a knowledgeable and engaging professor. One warning: though fascinating, the class covers a lot of material and can feel a little amorphous at times. Also, Professor Stern tends to lecture a lot during seminar- (Which can be great. Professor Stern is rife with knowledge and stories!) - but also means less student discussion and perhaps fewer students having done the reading.I would have preferred more student discussion and engagement, but to each his own.",
    "I loved this class. Wonderful professor and reading list, too little time to enjoy it. Don't let the low stress atmosphere of the class keep you from taking it seriously. In this class especially you're only hurting yourself.",
    "The evals for Stern's other classes couldn't have said it better... the guy likes to talk, so shop it, and if you like the sound of his voice and the way he thinks, take it. The reading list, consisting largely of books you've probably never heard of, is among the best that you'll find at this university. Worth taking for that reason alone.",
    "Yes. yes yes yes. You will learn to read in a new (loosen that technique!) way.",
    "You'll reads that fall into a genre Professor Stern as identified as labyrinthian. Walter Benjamin, Kafka, Borges and some people you've probably never heard of. I hadn't. You read it and then you deal with it as you see fit. The class is great. The readings are great. Stern is great. Take it, why don't you?",
    "This is a highly meandering but largely fascinating study of the century's most mind-bending authors. The curriculum veers abruptly from literature to geometry to music to urban architecture, all allegedly in the service of a \"higher-dimensional meaning.\" Professor Stern is one of the more heartbreakingly brilliant people you will meet.",
    "This course is extremely difficult to summarize. If you're like me, you looked at the syllabus and got excited about the authors - Cortazar, Borges, Kafka, Benjamin, Queneau - but had no idea why they were all part of the same course. And I'm still having trouble explaining it. But it worked! Some authors fit better than others. But it worked. In conclusion, you should consider taking this course if you like the following things: public transportation, maps of public transportation, lines that connect things with other things, symmetry, large things that resemble small things, objects that fit in the palm of your hand, and extended conceits.",
    "Take this to be exposed to unusual and exciting works of literature - and art, music, ideas too. Stern is fabulous and funny. He also has a no-nonsense policy about work, so you just read cool stuff and think about it.",
    "This class is phenomenal as the sum of its parts, but the whole is a little disorganized and scattershot. Take it for the Howard Stern experience and to read some phenomenal (and very, very unique and untraditional) literature. Don't expect the class to teach you much about labyrinthine prose as a category and you'll get more out of it."
