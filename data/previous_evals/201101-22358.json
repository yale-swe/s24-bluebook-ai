    "This was a great course. It's more of a HSHM course than a history course. You should have a decent understanding of biology if you want to take it. The reading load is heavy, but it gets better as the semester progresses because the first few weeks you read On the Origin of Species, which is extremely dense and time-consuming. However, it's completely worth it to read it because then you have the foundation for reading the texts in the rest of the course. You learn about different causal mechanisms for explaining evolution, paleoanthropology, eugenics, the human genome project, the evolutionary synthesis, social Darwinism, intelligent design--gives you a great overview not just of HUMAN evolution and its controversies, but all of evolution. You have a lot of latitude with choosing your research paper topic. Be warned, the first paper (\"summarize Darwin's argument and critique it\") is challenging and intimidating, but again, worth it since it will really help you understand him. Feel free to call Darwin \"Chuck\" by the end of this class. Miranda Paton is a wonderful instructor--she knows her Darwin and she's super enthusiastic and helpful. Take a class with her!!",
    "It is a good course for a writing credit. The beginning is the toughest part, especially when we had to write an essay on Darwin and read his entire Origin.",
    "I would recommend this course"
