   "comments": [
    "It's definitely a workload but it's very manageable. The way the work is setup is very step-by-step so that each assignment builds on the last one and nothing you do is really ever from scratch. In the end, you will definitely be better at writing in French.",
    "Definitely recommend. It's a great class if you want to improve your French writing dramatically within a short period of time.",
    "Some of the assignments are more enjoyable then others to write. But it's a great course. If you want to study upper level French this is a must take as your writing really does improve.",
    "Definitely!! The title of the course might sound intimidating and the workload might seem scary, but Mme. Pinzka makes everything SOO much fun and worthwhile (and she's always willing to work with your French level to improve your writing)!!!",
    "I highly recommend this course. You produce a piece of writing weekly, but turn in three drafts for each. The two texts (Exercices de Style and Taches d\u0092encre) are helpful in revealing a wide range of styles and approaches to writing in French. If you have previously struggled with French papers, this course will allow you to become much more aware of common mistakes and other weaknesses in your writing.Up to a certain level in learning French, your knowledge of grammatical structures and vocabulary is fairly limited, thereby dictating the content of your papers. To gain flexibility and freedom in writing, you should take a course like FREN 195 that forces you to produce a great amount of work. The only risk is that you develop a perfectionist tendency, as I did. By the end of the semester, each paper took a long time to write because I had learned so many different ways to say the same thing and had become more critical of myself. This can be used to your advantage if you can also maintain a degree of efficiency."
