   "comments": [
    "YES! I loved this course. I would urge you to try to stay on top of the reading cause this class only meets once a week and it is important to get the most out of it (as someone who fell behind and felt bad about not being able to utilize the class time effectively)workload is very manageable although the course has a huge ethnography group project at the end instead of a final. I have not particularly enjoyed doing ethnography but I think the classis definitely worth it to understand capitalism in a better way, through a number of different lenses and also allows you to really see if ANTH is a field you wanna get into. (important to note, even when the answer is no, the course is still enjoyable for the most part)",
    "After college, there will probably be only a handful of classes that really stick with you, that continue not just to provide you with information but change the way you look at the world. This is one of them. It's not at all just mindless capitalism-bashing (though sometimes people wanted to take it in that direction); it's an examination of what capitalism is and isn't, why it works and doesn't work, and how people experience it. If you haven't taken an anthropology class before (I hadn't), the introduction to the discipline alone would make the class worthwhile. The fact that it's on such a fascinating topic, with such great readings and a great professor who really cares about the students in his class, makes the class one that is definitely taking to take if you have the chance.",
    "If you get in, take it. If you're a sophomore interested in majoring in the social sciences (especially ANTH, SOCY, AMST, WGSS, etc.), definitely take it. Though the workload is sizable, it's completely worth it for many, many reasons, including (but not limited to) the well-chosen reading list, the chance to carry out hands-on ethnographic research, the moments of bonding among your fellow classmates, and the opportunity to study under the spectacular Prof. Rogers. An opportunity not to be passed up.",
    "A great course!! If you are a sophomore, take this one. You do NOT have to be an anthro major. And Prof. Rogers is amazing. A great jumping course from frosh seminars into all other seminars.",
    "It is a sophomore seminar in which you read about how capitalism affects the daily lives of people from how people view time to energy consumption. Anyone interested in gaining a diverse perspective of capitalism should take the course. The only view point that DJR tries to impose on you is that one type of capitalism does not exist and capitalism manifests itself in many ways (the course material is a testament to this). There is one midterm which is a short paper analyzing a newspaper article using the course readings. There is an ethnographic project in which you must conduct interviews and write a group paper.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT!!!! Professor Rogers is one of the greatest people you will meet at Yale, and trust me, you will so do all the readings! Through the research project you will have a chance to meet your classmates and explore New Haven or any topic of your interest. Definitely worth it!",
    "Yes! Take the course. I wanted to see if anthropology was for me as a major and it was great to read\/discuss ethnographies (as well as speak to one of the authors in class!) as well as do our own fieldwork.",
    "Hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. One great thing about it is it's a seminar consisting of only sophomores. Personally I think sophomore seminars are one of the best kept secrets at Yale. Professor Rogers is a super friendly, approachable, laid back guy. The course content and readings are all interesting -- it was a cool way to look at capitalism that was refreshing after years of the typical econ perspective. Grading consists of participation, take home midterm essay, and a final group ethnography project. The final project is a little intimidating at first, but actually turned out to be a lot of fun. I definitely would recommend this class.",
    "You get to look at capitalism from a really cool angle that you probably haven't before. A good amount of reading each week but nothing crazy.",
    "you learn to see cultures in a different light, and understand more about how different cultures engage with economic practices.",
    "CAPITALISM IS BAD. It's a narrative we hear all the time, but this class really sheds some nuanced complexity on the whole capitalism debate. ANTHRO with Rogers is awesome. He's the man- really intelligent and compassionate- and is down to explore capitalism in all its dirtiness and glory with his students. Take it. One of the best academic experiences I've ever had!",
    "Absolutely! Especially if you want to get your hands into some anthropological fieldwork. I think this is an exceptional aspect of the course. I learned a lot by conducting interviews.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale so far. The sophomore seminar model works really well -the class had a great dynamic, and everyone came to the table with a similar level of background knowledge, which meant that people were generally unpretentious.Professor Rogers does a great job at organizing the course. We learned just enough economic theory to have serious discussions and do real work. All the ethnographies we read were enjoyable and fascinating. Doing field-work was eye-opening.Take this class - it will change the way you see the world (including New Haven!) and yourself in it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone who wants yo think more critically and well roundedly about the social and economic institutions we live under. A fun and stimulating class that doesn't have a whole lot of work, and the work being done is quite interesting.",
    "ANTH 346 is an awesome opportunity to be introduced to the discipline of anthropology and talk about real-world themes of capitalism that you most likely will not have thought of prior to this class. It's a discussion based class where the readings are discussed heavily with the opportunity to do a research based ethnography for the final project, which is amazing as a sophomore to have this opportunity! I would certainly recommend it to another student. It is a unique class that you will be likely to take!",
    "Shop this class. If you think the material is cool, take it. You will regret it if you don't",
    "This was my first anthropology class, and I'm so glad I decided to take it. I learned a lot about the discipline, and it seems like other sophomores decided to choose it as a major based on this class. The class is a seminar done well- lots of student discussion, interesting and manageable readings, and a fantastic final project. The ethnography at the end should be enough reason on its own to take this course.",
    "This class grants a unique look at the cultural, economic, and human systems that define capitalism around the world, and it endows students with a more nuanced understanding of a concept that so often goes unquestioned in the 21st century. This is a chance to get into a seminar room with other passionate sophomores, read books you would never read otherwise, and work through some of the big questions of globalized Earth. Take it.",
    "An excellent and fascinating introductory course to Anthropology. Professor Rogers guides the students in stretching Anthropology to its limits, from analyzing everyday citizens in foreign cultures to critiquing wealthy and powerful individuals in the United States. You even critique the work and conflicts of anthropologists. Any curious person with any academic interests can take this course! Just be prepared to seriously stretch your mind and break down your perception of the capitalist world around you."
