   "comments": [
    "I learned how to consider legal, political, and moral issues from many perspectives so that I have a more nuanced perspective. The course also made me appreciate how much less straightforward many topics are in our current society.",
    "By taking this course, I gained confidence. As a result of professor Rosas's cold calling, you have to be on your game during every class. That being said, I gained the ability to not feel as shy about speaking up in a seminar here at Yale. Furthermore, I did not have an extensive background in philosophy prior to taking this class. However, now that I have taken this class, I can better digest\/analyze philosophical papers.",
    "My writing improved, my skills in thinking about philosophy vastly improved, and I have a far more complex knowledge of topics in political philosophy. Really, really helped me.",
    "Different political philosophical perspectives on the nature of freedom and when to limit it.",
    "This was an enlightening course grounded in political philosophy and its applications. The broad spectrum of the course was perfect for exploring a variety of different topics. The most fascinating part to me was exploring how each of the ideas or themes we discussed (individual freedoms, legal paternalism, equality etc.) was valuable to us as individuals, and subsequently understanding how they were framed to form an argument for one side or another. This deeper method of putting myself in the shoes of those I disagreed with was rewarding and eye-opening.",
    "I learned to analytically consider political philosophies and texts, while also acquiring important writing skills.",
    "This course got me to either reconsider or deeply question the beliefs I both about the law, 'morality and society. I find that I'm a much better analytical thinker and a better reader of political texts.",
    "What I gained most from this class was how to apply particularly difficult readings to actual laws and discuss the theoretical limits of freedom.",
    "I learned how to think critically and analytically about various legal frameworks and their applications to different case studies. I gained insight into the theoretical approaches of various political theorists and philosophers and learned how to craft a compelling argument.",
    "I developed my ability to argue on issues of governmental policy and social issues. The knowledge I gained by understanding the philosophers I read gives me the background to understand why I have certain political beliefs and how to understand and have conversations with those who hold different ones. Through the course, I was able to understand the basic philosophies dominant in government structures.",
    "Thinking analytically from different perspectives; ideas by various scholars and philosophers on what the law and freedom should be; Integrating different schools of thoughts into a coherent essay."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was structured into many units but was also flexible by allowing for the conversation to flow naturally. The class often felt at times like a passionate analysis of wide-ranging issues.",
    "This course needs very little tinkering; it is really excellently designed.",
    "The seminar setting makes it a great learning environment with discussions between students and the professor. There is a good amount of reading but teaches you to think from different perspectives.",
    "The course was very well organized, and the selected materials were perfect for exploring each subject area. I found the discussions particularly helpful. The insights offered both by Professor Rosas and my peers challenged my own perceptions of the material and issues presented, and prompted me to dig deeper and continuously reassess my understanding. I felt that perhaps at the beginning of the year, we could've gone over a couple strategies to approach the reading more effectively. While at times Professor Rosas guided our reading, telling us what we needed to read thoroughly and what we could \"skim,\" I still would feel overwhelmed by the volume of text to get through, and would've appreciated some general approaches to tackling the workload effectively.",
    "Very well structured, engaging debate, lively teacher. Perhaps asking students to guess one particular word was a waste of time.",
    "I wish the seminar discussion was a little less controlled. I recognize the importance of calling on individuals to respond to allow alternative speakers but it would have been nice to be able to immediately retort to other students comments in a sort of Socratic style.",
    "Very engaging, great discourse involved in the course",
    "A strength of this course were the multiple opportunities for seminar dinners and the engaging classroom discussions we had. A weakness was the ambiguity of what was expected for the first analytical assignment and the rigor of this course's grading scale.",
    "The strength of this course is that it covers many important topics within a short period of time. It does in depth with different philosophies while also connecting their ideas to real world issues. I am not sure how the course could be improved",
    "Strength: The course material is very interesting. It covers a wide range on the spectrum of opinions on law and freedom. The professor is very nice and well read. Whenever we give the standard of what should be allowed, he could always name counterexamples right to the point, and lead us to refine our standards. I think that process is very helpful in developing a comprehensive view on issues. Weakness: The final \"presentation\" doesn't seem like an actual presentation as we simply read out our opinions and continued our usual way of discussion."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in politics and law. The class is challenging but well worth the effort.",
    "I highly recommend this course since it provides multiple different frameworks for understanding political issues and topics. It also makes you question how much freedom should be allowed in a society and what restrictions are necessary. Professor Rosas is also an excellent teacher who is fair and very knowledgeable about the subject. Having office hours with him is great and he will push you to be a more critical thinker.",
    "I would, in fact recommend this course to other students. The material, although it may be challenging at times, is really interesting and allows you to notice and question the \"gray areas\" in society",
    "This is a great course; you will learn so much, read great political philosophy, and then as soon as you find it really compelling, read case examples that show its limitations. You will leave with many questions, but you will also have a better sense of your own ideology. You will also find topics that especially interest you, and you're able to pursue those in your writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because of the kind of outlook it gives you in viewing law and all the current events happening in the world. Great first class for political philosophy as well.",
    "I would (and have!) absolutely recommend this course to other students. The themes explored in the course are urgently applicable to society, and the insights offered by the philosophers, cases, and Professor Rosas are necessary tools to being an informed and productive citizen in today's world.",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale so far",
    "I'd recommend this course so long as you can actually allocate the time to do all the readings so as to get the most out of the class. Also, there are about 4 essays for the class, and that didn't seem like a lot but quality reality counts",
    "This was truly a fantastic course, and I would recommend it highly to any other Yale student. I learned so much and also enjoyed myself! Alexander is an incredible professor!",
    "Take this class if you're up for the workload. It's no work in the park and Alexander really pushes you in class. He leads you down a certain path in discussions and has you argue for stances you don't necessarily support. The essays are tough but he is a fair grader.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I found this course very enjoyable. It was a rewarding experience for me, someone who is interested in studying law and possibly going to law school in the future. The challenge of this course was intellectually rewarding.",
    "Of course. This course was my favorite course of college so far. The material was engaging and interesting and I felt as though my knowledge on issues such as cultural considerations and free speech was increased.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The discussion is very interesting and the way the professor guides it could bring out very different opinions on the spectrum of what should be allowed from a legal standpoint. Whenever we give our standards, he could always name counterexamples right to the point, and lead us to refine our thoughts. I think that process is very helpful in developing a comprehensive view on issues."
