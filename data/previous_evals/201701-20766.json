    "Nothing. I hated this class.",
    "By taking this course, I learned how to think more critically about psychology, history, and philosophy. This course taught me to consider the intersection between these disciplines in a way that I never had before and was able to emerge with a new understanding of how to consider the \"other.\"",
    "The ability to look at scientific progress and otherwise seemingly objective and non-biased human projects with a critical lens.",
    "Other minds was a really cool perspective on the way animals and humans and other beings have been portrayed, historically and scientifically, over time. The class unearthed some very deep questions about human uniqueness, the nature of intelligence, evolutionary change vs. learning, etc. It made me more humble in my human perspective, and more excited to explore the \"unvelt\" of others.",
    "This class was excellent for helping me think critically about science (and especially psychology) not only as historical fields but manipulatable disciplines. The course projects do a good job of developing a certain kind of writing (popular science, especially). I learned a great deal from the readings as well as from the guest lecturers; discussion was always productive.",
    "To be honest I dont think I really gained much from this course. Many of the readings were interesting (I really liked the Darwin and historical stuff, as well as the Richeson and Summers about structural inequalities), and I definitely gained something by reading them. However, there was a lot in the readings and in class we either failed to or didnt even try to examine the readings at any appreciable depth. In class, especially near the end of the class, we liked to talk about the course themes, like ontogeny vs phylogeny, degree vs kind, etc. But we did little more than identify that yes, we can see the distinction between ontogeny and phylogeny in these different pieces, just like we did last week. I think the coolest thing about this class was the visiting professors, who were able to speak from a place of knowledge and passion. I especially enjoyed the professor who talked about octopuses. I didnt realize that they had such complex capacities, and I was fascinated by the fact that their experience of being is so radically different from that of humans because of things like their much more evenly distributed nervous system (2\/3 of their neurons are located in the peripheral nervous system). I didnt learn any skills in this class.",
    "I learned a lot about the critical engagement of ideas that transcend categorical disciplines. Big ideas are influential because they pervade more realms of knowledge they one could imagine. Yet, they are also the ones that deserve the most multifaceted critical analysis. I honestly did not gain much new knowledge. What I did gain was an understanding of how to make use of present knowledge to formulate thought-provoking arguments. In many ways, this course allowed me to be my best self, both in an intellectual sense and a personal one. Somehow, it was possible to be both at the same time. It was enough.",
    "How to think and problem solve",
    "The ability to analyze scientific developments over time through a historical lens was fascinating.",
    "I learned how to interpret and analyze science across different time periods, how to discuss themes and shifts in science across time, and how to communicate scientific findings and critiques effectively to other people."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was no need for a TA. Given the fact that there were two professors and a TA, it was incredible how slow the pace of the class was, and how hard it was to participate. There should have been smaller group-teacher interactions. It almost felt like the teachers were there to watch us struggle, and added nothing to the class.",
    "Professors Santos and Cowles took student feedback very seriously which I appreciated, and when they made the seminar more discussion-based and grounded in the readings I enjoyed the course much more. The readings were interesting and challenging and class discussions were enriching. Due to the diversity of interests and backgrounds in the class, discussions were able to integrate a lot of perspectives but also meant that it was difficult to always feel engaged in the conversation.",
    "Weaknesses: A little scattered at times, and trying to cover a lot of ground by sheer breadth of fields were cross-listed in, not necessarily a bad thing, just something to work on Strengths: amazing course, really good syllabus, amazing idea, brought together so many great thinkers",
    "Profs Santos and Cowles are great and were very thoughtful about the class. I would take any class with them, even though this one wasn't particularly great. I appreciated that the readings were limited to a reasonable amount and chosen carefully. And it was good that there was a reading response because then everyone did at least some reading. There were too many people, and the topic seemed a little fluffy\/repetitive. It annoyed me when the profs would allude to \"scoring bonus points\" in discussion, even though they were half joking. Wasn't a huge fan of the \"group work.\" I don't get why the TA is reading our work when there's two professors. The visiting professors were cool. I liked the discussions we had with them.",
    "The strengths are that HOC santos and prof cowles are incredibly smart and kind and invested in the class. It's unfortunate, though, that the class was over 20 students-- so it was difficult for the discussion to flow naturally and beneficially to all.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is its seminar-style and leadership from Arber Tasimi, Laurie Santos, and Henry Cowles. It was an extremely engaging class and readings were (usually) stimulating. Sometimes course direction was unclear, however, and the directions for both papers were a little confusing.",
    "Something about class discussions felt weird to me in this course. Maybe there were too many people or the wrong questions asked. I felt somewhat infantilized when we would get \"dings\" for class themes. I also got tired of the same questions repeated for each week. Maybe the idea of a class centered around other minds is at once too specific and too vague--it's hard to make connections between the minds or understand exactly what we are learning but also the class became centered around certain topics that were annoying in their repetitiveness (they didn't evolve or grow, just were mentioned every class like anthropomorphism, methodology, etc)",
    "The strengths of this course were that there were really fantastic and engaging readings each week. The assignments for the midterm and final essays were also solid, allowing us to explore pretty much whatever we liked. Additionally, three out of the four professors who lectured before class and took part in the discussion during class were interesting in and of themselves and imparted some great knowledge (to be clear, the professors were much more interesting in discussion than in lecture. The ant lecture was easily the most interesting. The meditation lecture was fine. The other two were pretty unengaging). However, the bulk of the actual class ranged from marginally interesting to extremely frustrating. I really appreciated that Professors Santos and Cowles took some steps to radically change how the discussion was going to focus more on historical trends as they developed through the readings and themes that reappeared. The discussion for the first couple of weeks was amorphous and undirected, veering in the direction that the most vocal and least conscientious students (mostly males) wanted. This also happened to be a rather pseudointellectual direction more often than not. This did get better as the semester progressed, but the depth of the conversation remained rather minimal for all but two or three classes. There are a couple of things that might help remedy this lack of serious and interesting engagement. First, set an expectation that EVERYTHING MUST BE GROUNDED IN THE TEXT. I really wanted to discuss and dive into the texts, not talk about whatever tangential philosophical issue was most titillating me at that moment. Well more than half of the students didnt even bring their texts to class, and when the handful of students that bothered to bring the texts and cite actual passages did so, it was the embarrassing instance of the-student-who-is-trying-to-hard-or-being-condescending, not the expectation. Grounding arguments and discussions in the text should be the expectation, not the exception. The professors have some role to play in this in directing the conversation, coming up with interesting questions to ask about specific texts or passages. Second, the composition of students should have been different. The class as it is is best for people who arent really familiar with anything on the syllabus but want a fun, superficial introduction. If the professors want to make the course more serious, they should choose students who have expertise specifically in either animal cognition or history of science. Obviously this doesnt have to be everyone in the course, but this should be the majority of students. Students who havent been exposed to this material should obviously be welcome and admitted to add different perspectives, but if this is an upper level class, it should be mostly comprised of students who can analyze the material at an upper level. If a version of this class is taught again and the professors decide to take the latter course, that would allow for another improvement, which would be more historical perspectives on the readings. Until the last few weeks, we read pieces from history but we didnt really grapple with the historical contexts. Basically while we covered animal behavior and cognition, Professor Santos directed the conversation and Professor Cowles made peripheral, side note comments. There should be more of an equal lens of psychology and of history. Also, I dont know if Professors Cowles or Santos ever read any of the papers we submitted. Whether or not that was the case, a lot of students did not think that anyone but Arber read the papers. If professors are teaching a seminar, they should be the ones who read the papers.",
    "The course could gain a lot from having a more consistent and structured scheduled. Little time was given between the notification of reading assignments and the actual deadline for responses. The courses best strength was its lack of a framework. It forced us to tackle ideas and create our own.",
    "The design of the course, (the syllabus, guest lecturers and mix of humanities and sciences) was a great premise, and I really enjoyed the readings each week, and the opportunities to talk with experts in their fields. Overall I think the biggest weakness of this course is that class discussions were very poorly facilitated. Class was so overly organized to the point where instead of allowing free flowing discussion, there were specific topics that had to be adhered to. What's worse was that discussions felt more like one person making a comment, followed by another person making a valid, yet completely unrelated comment. It felt like a small lecture where we raise our hands instead of a seminar at times.",
    "The strength of the class was the way it fashioned discussions each class. This improved iteratively with each class, which was a huge feat of pedagogy.",
    "This was a pretty good class for its first run -- Prof. Cowles and Prof. Santos did a great job taking account of student evaluations and improving the course as time went on. Strengths: 1) I really enjoyed hearing from the 'other minds' experts throughout the course and the discussions with them, 2) I enjoyed getting to focus on a different mind, which allowed us to personalize the course according to our own interests, and 3) Prof. Cowles, Prof. Santos, and Arber were all extremely helpful, caring, and great with improving the course based on student feedback. Weaknesses: 1) Discussion facilitation seemed to be a challenge that improved as the semester progressed -- I think group work helped with this. And perhaps a smaller class size would also help? 2) I felt that the questions we were asked to answer about the readings seemed to be really repetitive (\"what's changed\" \"what would this author be surprised by?\") week to week -- I would have liked to answer and discuss questions that were more personalized to the readings and the topic, 3) I felt that there could have been more of an incorporation of our own individual 'other minds' that we were focusing on in a class -- perhaps there could be a class or two devoted to presenting\/discussing our other minds around a certain topic. 4) I thought the syllabus for the class was very animal-heavy and would have liked to learn about more 'other minds' that involved identities (ex. LGTB, racial identity) and more about other people in general"

    "Absolutely not. A complete waste of time.",
    "If offered again, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about the intersection between psychology, history, and philosophy. The fact that students came in with various backgrounds and interests meant that class discussions were always enriching (though sometimes hard to always be engaged).",
    "Yeah! Take as many Schulman Lecture courses as you can",
    "Professors are great, class is meh.",
    "Other minds was great, hoc santos and prof cowles are wonderful. It's a bit tricky because the class is large (and oversubscribed generally) and that takes away from discussion, since 20+ people are trying to speak. But it's enjoyable and the guest speakers are lovely and catered dinners are great. Our TA Arber, who graded everything, was pretty strict, but honestly overall an interesting and not too difficult course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Other Mindsit was an excellent experience as well as a great course, and it never failed to fascinate.",
    "I doubt this course will happen again because I think these Schulman classes only happen once, but I wouldn't recommend it. I had really high expectations but I didn't enjoy going to the class and didn't find the discussions stimulating. I do think the professors were really thoughtful in trying to make the class better so it might be better if offered again.",
    "I would not recommend you take this class if it is the same version that was taught this year. I took this class because Ive taken courses with both Professor Santos and Professor Cowles and like both of them a lot. Im also fascinated by what the syllabus covers and what readings were assigned. This class was largely a disappointment. I learned a couple of things, but not much. Parts of it were interesting, but the vast majority was dealing with superficial conversations and pseudointellectual meanderings. This class simultaneously took itself too seriouslyhaving a TA who expected you to email a draft before submitting your midterm\/having a TA at all in a seminar with two professorsand not seriously enoughtoo often letting the class devolve into tangential conversations that barely related to the texts. Professors Cowles and Santos did a lot to work with what they had. They made some major changes that made the course much better at the end than it was at the beginning. But it was still only enjoyable for me if I set my expectation that I wouldnt learn much, and that maybe there would be one aspect of each class that caught my interest. There were exceptionsthe octopus, ant, and meditation professors all ran excellent discussions. But besides that it was occasionally interesting, more often unremarkable, and most often tedious to the point of frustration.",
    "Absolutely! However, I recommend that you take it with the caveat that you truly give all your intellectual power to deal with complicated theories.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course as it is. It's a great premise, and the professors are clearly very impressive, but it seemed like Santos and Cowles were totally unaccustomed to seminar teaching. Discussions were painfully organized to the point of everyone going around the room and responding to topic themes instead of having an actual discussion. I was really excited about this class (who wouldn't be with the professors?) but it was massively disappointing. Santos and Cowles even hired a TA....(it's a seminar, with TWO professors, why is a TA grading papers??) I would seriously advise staying away from this class until the professors get a little more familiar with seminar structuring.",
    "If you can get in, you must take this class. HOC Santos and Professor Cowles represent the best that Yale or any Academic institution have to offer.",
    "Yes, take the course if you can get in! It's definitely a work in progress, but the course is extremely rewarding as you get to learn how to interpret, analyze, and critique science across time periods. You get to study a different 'other mind' each week (ex. ants, politics, octopus, etc) You also get to research and focus on your own \"other mind\" you are curious about. The workload is pretty manageable - it's 4-5 readings (or 50ish pages or less) a week, a midterm essay, and a final essay. There are 4 schulman lectures that are really interesting -- you get to attend all the lectures and have dinner with four experts in different areas. It's an interesting mix of psych, other sciences, and humanities. Prof. Santos and Prof. Cowles are great."
