    "This class definitely opened my eyes to a different way of thinking and seeing the world. I enjoyed how the professor really cared about each weeks' discussions and challenged her students to think about what they said in class. The materials we read and the films watched were immensely satisfying and interesting. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in exploring the issues of gender, social hierarchy, transnationalism, and simply the relationship between societies in the Asia and the US.",
    "I enjoyed this course! It was a thorough exploration of different concepts related to identity and the modern family. Readings were interesting, workload was very manageable, relatively easy (albeit perhaps not tremendously helpful) writing credit. There were a lot of concepts wrapped up in this course, so much so that occasionally the sum total felt a bit disorganized and lacking clear direction. But generally a great course, and Prof. Chanda, though occasionally not subtle about expressing and asserting her own viewpoints, was wonderful and very engaging!",
    "changed my world view fundamentally.",
    "I would NOT recommend this course to another student."
