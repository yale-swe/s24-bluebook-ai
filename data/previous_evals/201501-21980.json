    "English 126 is required for the English major. It may not have been my favorite subject matter, but it became a course I truly enjoyed because of the teaching prowess of Catherine Nicholson. If you are to take Engl 126, take it with her. She is eloquent, engaging, thoughtful, clarifying, and talented. She included Gluck on the syllabus, most recently, to introduce true modernity and diversity. This is very much enjoyed.",
    "Yes! Especially with Nicholson. Although, if you're gonna be an English major, you don't really have a choice about taking it.",
    "As they say: no pain, no gain. The material and papers are challenging, and Professor Nicholson maintains high expectations. However, she is an accessible and insightful instructor. In the end your perspective on English literature will be far richer, your resolve stronger.",
    "ENGL 126 is definitely my favorite of the Major English poets. Even after reading Paradise Lost in DS I got a lot from a more thorough second time; we definitely spent too long on Wordsworth; but the modernists were my favorite. I loved that we got to include Louise Glck at the end of the semester: fantastic poet, and a reminder that English poetry isn't dead (or all men). If you have a chance ABSOLUTELY take engl 126 with Cathy Nicholson. She's phenomenally intelligent and excited about poetry, great at leading discussion, and a really generous grader too.",
    "Don't take this unless you are an english major. Cathy Nicholson is a good prof if you have to take the class. But she is a somewhat hard grader but fair.",
    "I had the same thoughts about 126 as I did about 125: for a sequence of required classes that are touted as kind of terrible and a necessary evil for the English major, it was actually surprisingly enjoyable. I don't know if I'd recommend it for non-English majors (although you do get a good feel for several very, very important poets who you can now cross off your reading list) but for English majors, I'd say take it with Professor Nicholson, and you will find yourself pleasantly surprised.",
    "I would certainly recommend it, particularly for the second half of the course (Yeats, Eliot, and Gluck). That said, the selection of authors does vary depending on the professor. It is a lot of close-reading, which can take some getting used to, but it's an incredibly rewarding feeling to look back at the end of the semester and see the evolution of English verse and poetic tradition.",
    "It's a good class overall, the syllabus is good, but be warned that a lot of your experience in the class depends on your classmates--an unpredictable factor. Professor Nicholson is great."
