    "Take it. Everything on the syllabus is worth reading and you really get to know about the evolution of Russian lit.",
    "I enjoyed Russian Literature& Empire very much. This semester the class was particularly small at only 5 students but that did not prevent Professor Brunson from coming to every class with great preparation and clear excitement about the texts. I enjoyed the small class size because it necessitated greater participation from each student. Student participation was frequent and insightful because of the manageable reading load which allowed for students to finish the reading each week. The work load consisted of a reading a great chronological chain of authors, a midterm, a short essay and a longer research essay.",
    "Yes definitely. It's a must take!"
