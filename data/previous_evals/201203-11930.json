   "comments": [
    "It is a very challenging class, do not take it for an easy language credit but if you have any interest in learning french I guarantee that you will learn an unbelievable amount in a very short amount of time. The class involves weekly tests on Monday nights which can be a little bit of a drag but it's not something that should dissuade you from taking French if you are interested, they're not that bad and you get used to it.",
    "Recommend!",
    "This course moves very quickly and has a significant work load. Take this course if you're willing to work, but know that it is demanding.",
    "Take it if you want to learn French.",
    "For a beginner French class, the class was very fast paced. They immerse you in the language. At times it was hard to keep up or to grasp the rules or concepts. But overall the class was a good one. By the end of the course I knew more french than when I went into it.Professor Foss was true to the immersion portion of the curriculum. He tried very hard to give his students an overall view of French. He was enthusiastic in every class and he knows french very well. His method of teaching is not for everyone though. He doesn't not do grammar and conjugation tables, andhe doesn't like using mnemonic devices. If you can go without being taught grammar and conjugation to their full extent than Professor Foss is great.I would definitely recommend this course but make sure you've got an instructor that has a teaching style you are comfortable with.",
    "French 110 is a fun and enjoyable language class. There is nothing to complain about this class."
