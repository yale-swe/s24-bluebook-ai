    "A course that continues teaching the fundamental of modern hebrew while focusing on usage.",
    "I'd recommend it; if you've taken the earlier Hebrew classes, it's pretty much exactly the same format. Assigned homework (a lot of it), weekly journal entries, occasional recording, hebrew tables, and section. The sections this year were excellent because we met 2 on 1 with a ta and practiced speaking for 25 minutes. It's definitely a manageable class, and I loved having Ayala again! I imagine the class would have been very different if I had taken it with Dina, even though they teach the same material.",
    "If you want to solidify your grammar, learn how to speak properly in Hebrew, and have an amazing, fun, and qualified teacher, then take the class.",
    "Phenomenal class. Ayala is the best teacher, ever. Most of you don't have a choice, have to take this as a continuation of L1\/2, but don't fret, Ayala makes things fun and your Hebrew will truly progress. I highly recommend it, but beware the superfluous homework (literally, so much homework), as it can sneak up and be a pain to scramble to do before class."
