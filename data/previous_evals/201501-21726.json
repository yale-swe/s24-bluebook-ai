   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone wishing to learn more about a period of history that is so often overlooked by the required history classes.",
    "This course is interesting, but it is certainly not a gut. It is a lot of information and most of the IDs that you have to know for the exams are people with the same names or very similar names and it can get pretty confusing. Most of the class focuses on the hellenistic world, not Alexander. The grading is also somewhat difficult. With that said, I would certainly recommend this class to someone who is interested in Ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world, but if you are looking for an easy gut- look elsewhere.",
    "This course gave a really interesting overview of Hellenistic history. The first two weeks focus on the rise of Macedon and Alexander the Great, and the rest covers various aspects of the post-Alexander Hellenistic world. Professor Manning is a very good lecturer and makes the material interesting by bringing in cutting-edge research on climate change, technology, etc., in the Hellenistic era. I would absolutely recommend taking this course for a WR credit. You'll write two short papers (5 pages each) and one long paper (10 pages), which is really just an extension of one of your short ones. The midterm is very study-able, as it consists of IDs, a map section, and a short essay. The final is more challenging, as it tests your understanding of the readings and asks you to synthesize them into a longer essay.",
    "You will learn a ton about a pretty random area of history, so if that excited you then take it. We really only learned about Alexander for like two lectures, then it's the history of Greece, Egypt, and western Asia from Alexander until Rome for the rest of the course. A decent but standard amount of work- paper, midterm, final, sections. There wasn't much incentive to go to lecture since the exams were just from readings really.",
    "It's a pretty good course if you're looking for an easy HU\/WR credit. Workload isn't unbearable, as there's only 1 paper if you're taking it for HU credit and 3 papers for WR credit. DO NOT come into this class expecting to learn about Alexander the Great; this class is more about the fallout after Alexander's death. It's an interesting time period, for sure, but there are lots of names and events to memorize for the midterm and final. Basically, it's not a gut, but it's also not difficult, so if you think you may be interested go check it out.",
    "Take the class if you need a WR, but don't expect it to be an easy A. There's not a lot of work if you don't do all the readings, but the exams are all on the readings; the lectures will not prepare you for them. Overall, though, it is an interesting course imparts of history that may have been glossed over when you too ancient history in middle of high school.",
    "Definitely not an easy history class. I would describe it as lacking structure but containing some interesting material.",
    "Take it. It's not much work and, if you're interested in history, it's a really interesting class. Its worth noting that Alexander the Great dies about 4 lectures in though.",
    "I enjoyed the class overall. I do feel like there was an imbalance between lectures and readings, being that the exams relied almost exclusively on the readings it seemed. The readings were hit or miss honestly.",
    "Good course if your interested in the classics.",
    "Take it, interesting",
    "Awesome, comprehensive class if you're interested in the period at all. Lectures are short and fun. Light work focused on reading a series of short documents and bits of Shipley's framing historical narrative for them. Even if you resist that tiny workload you'll learn something despite yourself in your all-nighter before the midterm and then become the annoying friend who keeps bringing up Arsinoe II during Game of Thrones. Recommended.",
    "This course proves, at least to me, that there is more to Hellenistic history than Alexander the Great. After this course I feel like I have a comprehensive understanding of the period between the classical Greek period and the rise of Rome. If you are interested in any part of ancient history, you need to take this course.",
    "Lectures were fun and engaging, sometimes the course felt it lacked structure and jumped around chronologically. Overall very enjoyable",
    "I would recommend this class. It's interesting and the subject material will probably be new to most students. It's a fairly easy humanities credit.",
    "HIST 300 is an overview of the Hellenistic era. It is really interesting and fun, and Professor Manning is really engaging.",
    "A very interesting class, taught by a fantastic lecturer. In content, it covers technology, war, politics, immigration, propaganda, and the general history of the Hellenistic world from Alexander to the decline of Ptolemaic Egypt.",
    "Alexander the Great? More like Alexander the Mediocre.",
    "Yes. It's a cool class. You get an overview of a pretty complicated period of history as well as a look at the way historians who look at ancient history work with documents",
    "I would very much recommend this class to another student. It provides a solid overview of the Hellenistic period and the foundations of western culture. It is not difficult to follow, and if you do the readings, it will be very rewarding.",
    "Yes, great history course with a WR if need be",
    "Great survey of the Hellenistic time period with a constructive focus of main themes such as empires, empire building, social, economic, and political tensions.",
    "Yes, solid and interesting course.",
    "This is an excellent course that surveys Hellenistic history. Learn about Alexander and his world-changing campaings; see how the great Hellenistic empires were formed; see Greek science at one of its high points; and see how the coming of Rome changed the Greek polis forever. It's an awesome course. I highly recommend it. Plus, you might discover how volcanoes in Iceland contributed to Hellenistic instability, rebellion, and wars.",
    "Only take this class if you plan to use it for your major.",
    "Not a bad writing credit, tough final.",
    "Not the most exciting material but more interesting than one would think. Decent course. The course is more about Alex the Great as the period immediately after him.",
    "HIST 300 is a great class for every student who is genuinely interested in ancient history. It focuses on many different aspects of the hellenistic world, not only politics, but also changes in society, religion, philosophy and literature. Therefore it really encompasses a lot of aspects which are all equally interesting.",
    "I would tell another student that this is a crash course on the Hellenistic period and I would definitely recommend this class to anyone mildly interested in ancient history."
