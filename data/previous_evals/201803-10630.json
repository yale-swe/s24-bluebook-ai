I learned LOTS of mechanisms and what organic compounds these mechanisms take, the reagents and solvents used, and the predicted organic products. Ellman relates some orbital theory in his lectures, but it is enough to get by without understanding orbital theory too much. Ellman spends a lot of time to the foundations of Organic chemistry with application in reactions, then jumps right into stereochemistry and its effect on reactions and then finally a LOT of mechanisms by the last week or two.",

    "Myriad organic chemical reactions and basic concepts.",
    "Organic Chemistry was a whole new language for me. Coming into this class, I was nervous that I would need to be a general chemistry expert, but it was so different. This class taught me an introduction to the language of organic chemistry and truly taught me on how to be discipline in learning course information over time, not all before an exam.",
    "Lots of organic chemistry!- mostly reactions and stereochemistry. But beyond all the specifics and details of alcohol\/alkene\/alkane reactions, we developed an intuition for the reactions (electron-pushing) and for stereochemistry (drawing molecules, structures pre-and post bond breaking).",
    "In terms of knowledge, we learned a LOT of reaction schemes and mechanisms, what makes a molecule more stable than another, and naming of different molecules (including the different types of stereoisomers). This class, though, also went beyond just strict memorization. We were expected to come up with mechanisms for new reactions that we had not seen before, and the lessons provided the toolbox that we would need for it.",

    "Better knowledge about organic chemical reactions and organic molecules as well as overall chemistry concepts.",
    "Professor Ellmans Organic Chemistry course gave us a solid understanding for the types of reactions that occur for a variety of chemical groups - and what mechanisms explain why they occur. I learned to think more critically about some of the reactions we had seen in General Chemistry, and have my previous chemistry background a lot more context.",
    "I learned how to memorize a book and not much else.",
    "This course taught me the basics and ideas of Organic Chemistry",
    "I gained insight on the mechanisms and foundations of organic chemistry, and life at a molecular level.",
    "I learned so much taking this course. This course allowed me to understand chemistry in a way that I never had before by actually teaching me about the mechanisms that we had been told about in the past. It facilitate problem-solving skills and application of learned materials to novel situations.",
    "I learned an incredible amount of how to learn things in a new way since Organic Chemistry is such a unique course to learn.",
    "The stereochemistry and the formation of basic chemical mechanism.",

    "Developed the ability to work at a steady pace",
    "I learned basic organic chemistry, reactions, syntheses, and mechanisms.",
    "This course gave a wonderful, in depth overview of many of the concepts needed to understand organic chemistry. The content was straight forward and taught very well. This course strengthened my understanding of basic principles in chemistry such as bond strength and geometry, electronegativity, and intermolecular force interactions. I also learned a lot about stereochemistry, reaction types, regioselectivity, and a general idea of how reactions proceed.",
    "This is a little more accelerated than your average organic chemistry course. You will definitely have to learn how to manage the workload",
    "All",
    "I learned the importance of deeply understanding material as opposed to rote memorization.",

    "I learned a lot of organic chemistry - mostly covering relevant gen chem material, stereochemistry, and a lot of reactions with their respective mechanisms.",
    "I learned about reactions of alkenes, alkyl halides, alcohols, ethers, and epoxides. I learned how to draw mechanisms by pushing electrons to synthesize products. I learned about 3d stereochemistry, how to think in 3d, and how to manipulate molecules in my mind to see the stereochemical relationships. Organic chemistry is so elegant, and I learned how to appreciate its beauty more. I also realized the importance of organic chemistry in developing the drugs that we rely on today.",
    "None. This course teaches you a lot of facts but you don't really learn much",
    "I developed a basic understanding of the principles of organic chemistry.",
    "In this class, you learn a lot about the mechanisms of organic reactions (how these reactions actually happen). You focus a lot on acidity and basicity of molecules in order to determine which reactions would be able to occur.",
    "You learn how to understand the basics of organic chemistry of how to do nomenclature, but then delve into tough mechanisms that require you to take what you know about the reactants and solvents to determine the course of the reaction. It's a class that teaches you to keep up with the content, and to make sure you are on top of everything.",
    "I learned that a lot of organic chemistry is acid\/base chem, I got better at arrow pushing and developing my chemical intuition, and I solidified basic chem concepts in my brain.",
    "I learned about didgerent synthesis reactions and how ti characterize those reactions.",
    "I developed the skill of being able to identify organic structures and the processes they go through to yield a certain product.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The information is presented far too quickly so it's difficult to understand what is going on during lectures.",
    "This course is very thorough, and accomplishes all the goals of an introductory organic chemistry course.",
    "Can include how and why organic chemistry is important in human life and in advancing scientific research.",
    "Course was really well organized. There was a lot of new content suddenly introduced at the end, which was kind of overwhelming, but otherwise it was a pretty well-paced course.",
    "The course might be big, but help is always readily accessible via Ellman or your TF. Section is optional, but the teaching staff create worksheets that go over tricky concepts we've learned the past week in class that really help. There are ample practice exams posted so we can get a sense of what to expect, and homework is based on completion rather than accuracy, which truly facilitates learning. But, even if this seems easy, the course itself is not easy, especially toward the end. No matter how much Ellman warns us of this, people get destroyed because they trick themselves, so don't fool yourself too early on.",
    "Strengths: Professor Ellman is amazing! He is extremely knowledgeable and engaging in lecture. His notes are very organized and succinct, and if you take good notes in class and review them for the exams, you already have a good foundation of the knowledge. I also found going to section helpful, as it reinforced the concepts in class that I didn't understand and I had the opportunity to ask the TA questions. Weaknesses: Not really any major weaknesses in the teaching style. However, we moved quite slowly at first and then learned a LOT of material in the last 2 weeks of class, that will likely be covered a lot on the final exam.",
    "The grading is incredibly harsh. If you make one mistake on a problem worth a lot of points, you can sometimes get 0\/12 credit and it can ruin your grade.",
    "The class went very quickly without much review.",
    "It's pretty standard but organic chemistry is simply known to be difficult",
    "i think that it was good that the exams were during class and we didn't have to carve time out of our evenings to come take a test like literally every other stem class. one thing that was really annoying (and is going to hurt a lot during the final) is that we rushed through about 7000 reactions during the last week of class. i'm pretty sure we learned more reactions in the last week than in the entire rest of the semester, and the real kicker is that we have to spend reading week trying to teach ourselves these reactions.",
    "Was taught very well",
    "Ellman is a great teacher, begins very slowly so that no one felt lost. Last few weeks were definitely pretty fast, but I think most people were able to keep up, so it's not bad. Definitely the best chem professor I've had at Yale so far. Also just a very friendly person.",
    "This was a very strong course. The strengths of this course include professor Ellman is the best STEM professor Ive had at Yale. He is very organized and willing to answer questions, and he seems to truly enjoy teaching students and helping them understand. This is hard to do in a huge lecture, but he does a good job at it!",
    "I wish the TAs were more helpful. I feel like the chemistry department's TA's are not the best.",
    "One huge strength is that Professor Ellman is a great professor. However, no one I knew had a particularly good TA. To get help, we all had to go to Peer Tutoring. Additionally, the practice exams were released only 4 days before the exams, making it hard to be able to get help. The course could be improved by being recorded, so we can go back and look at what we were confused about.",
    "Strengths: Perhaps the greatest strength of this course is the teacher, Professor Ellman. Ellman is extremely explicit about what is important material, what is going to be on tests, and what is just supplemental material we do not need to study for. Since he writes down on the chalkboard everything he teaches, his teaching is clear and organized. He is also very humble--whenever a student catches his mistake, he is always more than willing to correct and acknowledge it. In regards to the course materials, I found the graded Sapling assignments (not graded on number of attempts!) to be helpful for studying and learning the material. Plus, Ellman's exams are fair in that he provides three practice exams per test, helping you focus on studying the concepts and not fruitlessly predicting the way in which the concepts are going to be tested. Overall, the workload of this class is not high (max 2-3 hrs a week on Sapling), and most of the work comes in studying for the midterms. Weaknesses: As many of my classmates have mentioned, a lot of the final exam deals with material that is presented in the last FOUR classes of the semester. I recognize that everything tested does hinge on a solid foundation of concepts covered throughout the rest of the semester, but I do feel there is a way to expedite the first part of the course so that the last part is less packed.",
    "I think we moved exponentially quickly, so a more steady pace would be better. I would have also preferred if we didn't drop a midterm and instead didn't have such a weighted final. The biggest strength was definitely Prof. Ellman, he is extremely friendly and a really good lecturer.",
    "Too heavy at the end. Final was hard.",
    "Strengths: ungraded sapling, layout of material, grading system, practice tests (I honestly probably would've failed without those) Weakenesses: was slow at the beginning and then VERY fast at the end, might've been nice to even out the pace more",
    "Some strengths of the course are the way in which it proceeds. The information is logically organized. I also liked that Professor Ellman provided three practice exams for each test. This allowed me to have a good understanding of what to expect for each exam. A weakness was that there was a lot of memorization, but that is expected for an organic chemistry class. Another thing is that the class meets very early all the way up on Science Hill.",
    "This course was very well-organized and clearly taught. In general, concepts in lecture were explained in a way that helped students understand the underlying chemistry behind reactions rather than just memorizing. The exams were very fair compared to homework questions. Since so many practice exams were provided with the exact format of the actual exam, they seemed formulaic, so it was possible to study by learning how to answer the specific format of the exam questions rather than actually understanding concepts at a deeper level. I think the pacing of the class could be changed slightly: the beginning of the course felt slow, whereas the last few weeks introduced most of the reactions we needed to know.",
    "strengths: does a good job focusing on applications and not just memorizing weakneses: kind of unbalanced in that the first third is a joke, the seocnd is average, and the third is more difficult",
    "I thought this course was very well-structured and taught. The supplementary help was great and Professor Ellman does a great job of explaining difficult concepts.",
    "A weakness of this course is the pacing: it is quite slow in the beginning, and then picks up very quickly in the last couple days of lectures. This may be improved by spreading out the material a little more throughout the semester, and maybe covering stereochemistry with the reactions instead of doing stereochemistry separately.",
    "Orgo is difficult but the course is very well taught and the exams are very fair.",
    "The strength of this course was Professor Ellman no doubt. He was so clear in lecture that the textbook was almost unnecessary. A class like this could in theory be learned from a textbook, but because of the mastery of Ellman this was the first relatively intro level science class at Yale that I felt was worthwhile going to the lecture. One weakness is that the pace of material accelerates quite rapidly towards the end of the course and maybe this could be ameliorated by covering some of the basics in the first few lectures more quickly.",
    "Professor Ellman often taught the material in a very simplistic, yet thorough way that made everything clear in my notes. However, one problem with the class was with the pacing. While the easier elementary material reviewing general material was taught quite slowly, the ending, more difficult material about alcohol and ester reactions were taught at a much faster pace, making it such that much more time was needed outside of class to review.",
    "strength: love that the practice tests mirror the actual exams weakness: did not find sapling or textbook questions to be helpful, felt more like busy work, because did not find them to be representative of test material",
    "This class is very well taught and supremely fair. Professor Ellman would give us three practice tests before each exam, which were identical in format and similar in content to the actual exams. The material was presented in a clear, straightforward way such that no one really had to read the book. It's a great class, the only weakness would be that section was not very useful I never really learned anything during the sections and as a result, stopped attending.",
    "Professor Elman is a good professor with fair tests",
    "One strength of the class is the flexible workload. it is really up to the student how much time they want to put into the class, since there is limited work outside of exams. one weakness is the pacing of the class. We covered topics steadily throughout the first 10 weeks of the semester. Then, in the last month, everything ramped up crazy fast as we tried to fit everything we hadn't learned but was supposed to, into just a few days of lecture.",
    "This course is well taught, and pretty well structures. I believe more practice problems could be helpful, but the combination of Loudon problems and Sapling was pretty good practice. I really appreciated the practice exams because they were a great indication of what I needed to know for the exams.",
    "Professor Ellman is a great lecturer, and you do learn chemistry well. There are two weaknesses of this class associated with grading. First, everyone gets a dropped midterm, but if you are sick, you must use that midterm as your drop, even if you have a Dean's excuse. This is incredibly unfair to students who get sick, for everyone else can drop a midterm they do poorly on (for whatever reason), but students who get sick do not get the flexibility to do poorly on one. Second, the class is graded on a point system, and this proves problematic for the dropped midterm system. You drop your lowest percent grade, NOT your lowest percentile. Take the current year's rough numbers for example. Say you got an 83% on the first midterm, where the average was about an 85%, and an 82% on the third midterm, where the average was about a 75%. In Professor Ellman's system, you'd drop the 82%, even though it was an above average score on the third midterm, and keep the below average 83%. This system advantages people who do well (relative to the class) on midterms with high averages.",
    "The course is taught in a very organized manner in which the material builds off itself as the semester progresses, and I think it is structured in a way to promote learning to any student who is willing to put in the effort. I also think that help is very accessible to those who seek it. I don't see any big weaknesses in the course.",
    "I think the course is great how it is. It is hard to teach organic chemistry.",
    "Very clear teaching and expectations. Wonderful.",
    "Although the material of this course is challenging, it is taught in a way that is very conducive to student learning. Professor Ellman does an incredible job with his notes as well as answering student questions in lecture and in office hours. I will say the TFs could do a better job at being able to explain the material. I have no doubt the TFs are brilliant, but that does not always translate to great teachers.",
    "Overall the course was very good. Professor Ellman was a wonderful lecturer. The amount of material did become a bit overwhelming at the end though.",
    "Very challenging course, discussion is helpful, perhaps more peer tutors\/hours would be helpful. Lecture is helpful!",
    "The use of Sapling this semester was amazing. It certainly helped to keep students on track. Also, Professor Ellman was fantastic; his lectures and notes were amazing.",
    "Lectures should be way more organized. I felt like I didn't even know what I was learning until it was time to study for the exams and everything I needed to know was laid out in the review sessions and on the practice exams. I am also biased because I truly hate this subject.",
    "The professor was the best one Ive ever had.",
    "I found it to be pretty procedural as opposed to conceptual, but maybe that is just the nature of the subject.",
    "The class was fine.",
    "This course is so much information in such a short period of time. I think the last third of the course should have been placed over a longer period of time because it had so much hard information and it felt like it was just shoved into the last few weeks.",
    "Very organized, clear, and straightforward! Ellman makes organic chemistry very doable and even enjoyable sometimes!",
    "The class is very well-designed! I would suggest a more even distribution of material over the course of the semester though. The first third of the curriculum was mostly review from general chemistry (and I took Gen. Chem 161!), and then we went over ~25 DISTINCT REACTIONS in the final four lectures.",
    "Strengths: A lot of practice problems available that really help you to understand the material. Textbook provides good in-depth explanations but also is not too dense of a readusually just skimming over the textbook right before the exam provided a really good review. Exams GREATLY resemble the practice exams, so you know exactly what to expect and what to focus on when studying. Sapling also provided good practice for the fundamentals. Weaknesses: The course seemed to move more slowly at the beginning, and the pace was more than manageable. At the end of the course though, we crammed a whole bunch of reaction mechanisms into maybe four lessons (while other universities usually spend weeks on these), and so it was a little difficult to memorize so much in such a short time, BUT because we had spent so much time on learning \/why\/ we were supposed to use certain mechanisms over others, memorizing these reaction mechanisms was not too hard since we could technically reason them out. The only problems were reactions whose entire mechanisms weren't provided, and so it was harder to reason those out and we had to just rely on straight memorization.",
    "I loved this course and learned a lot.",
    "The final was unreasonably more difficult than the practice exams provided to help prepare. The layout of the course could be improved; the course goes very slowly in the beginning so naturally it picks up as the semester goes on, but dumping so many reactions on us a week before the final felt unproductive. Professor Ellman was a good lecturer and did a good job explaining things.",
    "None",
    "Strengths were professor who was well organized, good tas, lots of help. Not too many weaknesses.",
    "It is very well organized and the expectations are very clear. Sometimes though, the exams arent very thought provoking.",
    "Very well laid out!",
    "The course was very well taught and had fantastic teaching assistants. Concepts were for the most part thoroughly explained, and I learned a great deal.",
    "The lectures are well taught, but the exams are very difficult. While I felt like I understood the material coming into the exam, I had a difficult time using what I had learned in lecture to succeed on the exams.",
    "The course was very organized. It is quite fast paced but the instructor is upfront with the challenges and expectations of the course, so it is up to you to stay on top of the material.",
    "The lectures were very organized and clear.",
    "I feel like in order to motivate us more to do things on time there should be more challenging psets similar to the one on exams. They should not be online.",
    "great professor, could have better Taste",
    "The course was extremely well taught. I have no complaints.",
    "Excellent professor, clear explanations. All tools needed to succeed are given to you.",
    "The lectures were very well organized",
    "Professor Ellman is great, and so are the TA's. His notes are very easy to follow and he offers a lot of resources to practice what you learn in class. I just wish it was less memorizing.",
    "The course had good teaching, but I believe the homework could have done a bit better in preparing us for the exams.",
    "I wish this course material was more accessible.",
    "Good explanations in class but I wish the tests and practice problems more closely matched exams, even though there were practice exams.",
    "Ellman is an amazing professor! I just wish the last two weeks of class werent crammed with content.",
    "This course is very well organized and well-structured. However, it requires a lot of self-monitoring and self-motivation. The homework system is very fair, but to succeed, students must keep up with the material on their own and make use of the various resources Professor Ellman provides, even if they will not be graded.",
    "I very much liked the problem set system (sapling graded for completion with ungraded textbook problems).",
    "Professor was very helpful and TA was terrific. All the support was great too, the peer tutors in particular helped a lot.",
    "Strengths: very organized, instructor gives great notes Weaknesses: more reaction problem sets would be helpful, especially for post-exam 3 material",
    "more guidance, more peer tutoring sessions",
    "Lectures were very helpful and the midterms\/finals were all fair game. Overall, it was a good class.",
    "An emphasis on understanding the chemistry, rather than memorization should be pushed by the instructor, as it is near impossible to remember all of the reactions presented, but a base understanding of why the reactions occur would improve the student's foundation of learning and ability to solve problems to a great degree",
    "This course is very well organized and",
    "Prof. Ellman is a great lecturer and presents the information in a very clear way. The exams are also straightforward although it can be difficult to figure out where to start studying as the progression of the class material can be confusing. Also, the morning walk up Science Hill 3 times a week is grueling. This class would be better later in the day or twice a week for a longer period.",
    "I thought this class was very well taught. I liked Ellmans teaching style in starting each class reviewing the material from the past lecture and building onto it. He provided us a strong foundation for the reactions we saw near the end of the semester. However, the final mostly pertained off of the last four lectures material (which, granted, built off of the material from before), and wish we had more time to familiarize ourselves with it and get more practice and explanations in discussion section. I also wish, honestly, that we had more homework besides the Sapling, as I wish I had been forced to get more practice with the material rather than work and study hard close to the midterms.",
    "This course is entirely predicated on memorization. Organic chemistry -- and other STEM courses -- should be taught in a small class with worksheets and evaluation to ensure student understanding. A once-a-week discussion section that covers 1\/4 of the material is utterly insufficient.",
    "This course has to establish a lot behind the general ideas of reactions for students to be able to understand why things work. A strength is the amount of time spent on the basics in order for students to have a full comprehension behind the reactions. A resulting weakness is the short amount of time left for the students to learn the actual reactions which were supposed to be the main focus the entire semester.",
    "Professor Ellman is a phenomenal lecturer and is very clear on structure and content when prepping for exams. However, I find that this class is very fast paced (as expected), and is very heavy in curriculum in the last few classes after the final midterm.",
    "This class was very well taught, and the material was presented in a way that was very helpful to learning. This is especially wonderful because the book is a bit dense and confusing, so having Professor Ellman present it in class first was really helpful!",
    "The strengths of the course are Sapling, which allows you to do psets with unlimited tries and therefore acquire lots of practice as well as the way that the practice tests are created to strongly mirror the actual exams. The weaknesses are the time that the class is conducted since it can be incredibly difficult to understand such complex material at such an early time.",
    "The course moves very fast. The readings are the same as the lectures. There are plenty of times to meet with TAs in office hours.",
    "Overall it's a really good course. The material is challenging but reasonable, the professor is great, and it moves at a reasonable pace. Maybe the last week could have been spaced out a little better but overall it's a good clear course.",
    "Course is chock full of information needing to be memorized. Strength of the course is the use of sapling learning. Weakness is the lack of explanations for answers to questions on practice exams.",
    "Prof. Ellman was a wonderful professor and very helpful. The TAs and peer tutors were also great.",
    "The course its taught extremely well. Many materials are given to ensure everything is understood. Assignments are reasonable and actually provide genuine help in learning the subject. Extra assignments from the textbook that are not turned in\/ graded are given which is super helpful since it provides another source of practice but does not add to the stress of the class. Towards the end of the semester the course moves very quickly as many reactions are given in a very short time but the preparation provided up to that point makes them easy to learn and understand.",
    "I think that having the course grade be determined 85% by tests is worrying and puts a lot of pressure on students to perform. The exclusion of quizzes this year was a negative in my opinion. Quizzes do well to help check on students progress before midterms. On the plus side, Prof. Ellman is an excellent lecturer as always. Maybe so good that most students rarely even check the textbook.",
    "Make it not a 9;25",
    "Providing an instructors copy of the notes, and more work during the course (quizzes or psets) would greatly improve it in my opinion",
    "The pacing of the course is fast. There are a lot of textbook readings that are assigned and sometimes it is difficult to find the connections between what appears in the textbook and what appears on an exam. The practice tests and lecture material, however, best prepared me for the exams.",
    "Taught well but a lot of material crammed at end",
    "The course is set up well for student learning. Between the lecture notes, sapling problems and Loudon assigned problems, there were a lot of opportunities to practice the material.",
    "This class was excellent overall. Prof. Ellman is generally very good at giving clear and engaging lectures and the practice tests are in the same format as the exams so you know about what to expect. The only flaw was the pacing - I wish we spent more time on the 16-ish reactions we went over in the last two weeks of class.",
    "The course material is pretty interesting. I think it would have been nice to have sections where we could review concepts taught in class to make it more repetitive and help us establish a good foundation with the material.",
    "Summary: Strengths: - very low workload - interesting content - Prof Ellman! - you get to drop one exam - exams are fair and there is sufficient practice Weaknesses: - too easy - I wish there were more problems tying all the reactions and mechanisms together - not enough figuring out puzzles as I thought organic chemistry would be One strength of this course is that there is basically no work outside of going to class and taking exams. There are sapling problems for each chapter, but they are due the week of the exam, so you can do them on your own schedule instead of working with a hard deadline. In addition, I dont see sapling as homework, but rather as a way to study, so I like to do them closer to the exam to see if I know the stuff. Otherwise, this class has pretty much no work, and it is a nice change for a STEM class. Professor Ellman is a clear strength in this class. He is the most organized professor I have ever had. Everything he says in class is clear and has a purpose, and he is always prepared for class. He does follow the textbook quite closely, but I really recommend going to class and hearing Prof. Ellman explain it. Then you will know what aspects of the chapter are being emphasized. I cannot stress this enough: GO TO CLASS. It's the only realistic way that you're gonna keep up with the material (you know you're not gonna be doing those sapling problems and textbook readings until the week of the exam), especially with all you premeds out there with a million other things to do. Another strength is that the exams were extremely fair. You always know what to expect on the exam because there are three practice exams to prepare you for each exam. Also, you get to drop one exam. The exams are pretty straightforward, but beware because Ellman is good at making the exams seem easy but puts little tricks in there to try to get you. The more you practice, the faster you will find these tricks. Although I was already super engaged in the content presented, I wish the class was harder. The exams didn't really test the majority of the reactions mechanistically. I wish we had to do retroactive synthesis where we are given a product that is the result of a multi step synthesis and figure out which steps were required to get the product and provide the mechanism for the formation too! I want the mechanisms on the test to be harder to including ozonolysis, hydroboration oxidation, oxymercuration reduction, etc. We mostly just had to memorize the reagents and net products for the majority of the reactions. Having more integrated mechanisms would emphasize more application of the material learned rather than just memorization. Especially on the final, I wish there was a question that synthesized much of what we learned in a single problem.",
    "This was, overall, a very good course. I liked the structure of the class for the most part, and I enjoyed Professor Ellman's teaching style. The homework style also made the course much less stressful, as we could do the homework whenever was most convenient for us before the due date. The downside of this course is definitely the last few weeks. There are many, many reactions covered over the last two weeks compared to earlier in the semester, and while it was certainly doable, it also felt very unbalanced.",
    "This course is good at making sure you know lots of specific facts about reactions but not much else",
    "The strengths of this course is the lecturer and style of lecture. I think it presented material very well. The main weakness is the organization of the material and making different concepts connect together.",
    "This class was very well organized and I felt like there was a lot of practice material in order to help students review topics and fully cement the ideas. One weakness was that since it covers such a large amount of material, classes have to go very fast. The content is also very challenging, so it is difficult to understand them the first time. I think it would be helpful if the class were videotaped so that students could go back to specific points in a lecture and review how the professor taught the material.",
    "Strength is Ellman. I'm so amazed by his teaching style and he truly made me love organic chemistry--and I'm not even a chemistry major! The class is SO organized, and sections this year were so useful. I heard from last year that sections never did worksheets, and so I'm glad that this year, section did have worksheets because it was so useful. I felt all the TA's were on top of their game, and my TA especially made sure he was available to help us, especially when exam dates came closer. In terms of exams, I think a strength of the course was having the 3 midterms (one could be dropped) + 1 final exam. It made sure we all stayed on top of the material, and also lessened the pressure of knowing that we couldn't afford to mess up on one test. Being able to drop an exam made me less worried about my grade, and it's a great structure especially because most students have a lot of other exams going on and so studying for orgo can be really rough when you have 2-3 other exams and papers to write too. I can't think of any improvements in terms of structure, but I did feel the last 2-3 weeks of Orgo felt rushed, and because we were in what I thought was the most challenging content of the course (SN1\/SN2\/E1\/E2) I found the pace to be fast. Maybe Ellman could try to pace this out more?",
    "The lecture style was clear but difficult to stay engaged with. It would be great if applications of the material were more integrated into every day lectures so it didnt feel like we were just memorizing equations. Also, it would be cool if homework problems brought in some more application too. I also would have preferred if Sapling were do every week, as I could have used the support to keep me on top of it.",
    "The course jelped me learn a lot and I like the way it is set up. No major weaknesses.",
    "The strengths are the lectures and the professor of the course. A weakness is the high percentage of the grade that comes just from the tests. I believe that maybe a biweekly quiz could help this.",
    "This course is one of the strongest chemistry courses I took at Yale. The course content is engaging and moves at a reasonable pace. By following the suggested reading and textbook problems, I was able to stay with the material even during challenging reaction units towards the end. The course builds on itself, applying concepts learned in the two months to content in later parts of the semester. In terms of weaknesses, I did feel surprised that the last two weeks between the midterm and the final exam weighed disproportionately on the final. I understand that it's an important unit, but I do feel that it demands more time--one extra week would be perfect.",
    "I loved that this class was well-taught by Professor Ellman and the discussion sections were helpful. However, it would have been nice if the last two weeks of the class were not so rushed.",
    "The way Prof Ellman wrote out the notes for every class was outstanding. Many other teachers do not have as organized notes. This made studying for his exams so much easier and I feel that I learned so much more because of the organization. More professors in the chemistry department should adopt this way of teaching. The problem sets were informative and helpful. It was extremely helpful to have unlimited tries for the questions; I hope that stays for following years.",
    "So much information hard to keep up",
    "Maybe even more problem sets",
    "Well taught. Contrarily to General Chemistry, you do not need to learn the material by yourself with the textbook: Professor Ellman teaches everything you need to know for his exams in a very simple and straightforward way. The workload is very manageable. The material can get tricky and there is a lot of it, but the expectations are very clear for the exams and Professor Ellman gives multiple practice exams which are exactly the same format and type of questions as the real exam, so it is easy to prepare very well and narrowly. No a lot of support\/help available: if you have trouble with some material, you'll have to figure it out by yourself.",
    "One strength of the course was the quality of teaching from Professor Ellman. While he does assign readings from the book to make sure fully comprehends the concepts we learn, paying attention during lectures was enough for most of us to understand. One weakness of the course was that I never truly knew what my grade in the class was. The class would receive feedback from the exams within one week, but this is without the Sapling problems added to the grade. This could be improved by utilizing the grades function on Canvas to put in our grades after they are released.",
    "Course was excellent.",
    "A strength was that the concepts were very thoroughly explained. A weakness is that in the last week of class, we were bombarded with multiple chemical equations we had to recall for the exam.",
    "very hard and harsh grading, lectures get confusing, low workload",
    "I enjoyed how Professor Ellman broke down each concept in the textbook each lecture, it made it a lot easier to understand."

    "I had to take it. My advice is to remember the end goal and what you are shooting for at the end of the day. Remembering that makes this class bearable.",
    "No - the information is presented too quickly and in too great of quantities.",
    "This class is a great intro, but really only has information valuable for STEM majors.",
    "No, it is a very dry and hard course. However, it is probably required for majors and professional schools.",
    "Orgo isn't as horrible as its reputation makes it seem. Professor Ellman was really great at explaining principles, and solving orgo problems is a bit like solving puzzles. It was a pretty enjoyable course.",
    "You're probably in this class because you have to be, and not for kicks, but regardless, the experience is not as painful as it may be recounted to be at other institutions. Know that the material might seem slow and easy at first, but really picks up after the first midterm, and the last two weeks between midterm 3 and the end of classes are absolutely brutal (we tripled the number of reactions we'd learned in 5 lectures).",
    "Yes!! Take this course with Professor Ellman. He is a great professor to learn organic chemistry from and he makes a smooth transition into learning about the concepts from general chemistry. There is not much homework on the weekly basis, but I would definitely keep up with the material as it accumulates quite rapidly, especially as your other classes start picking up the workload too.",
    "Yes, it's a requirement for pre-med and some majors",
    "i mean this isn't really my thing but if you have to take it you have to take it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it if you need it. Wouldn't be a bad course to take for a science credit, but really no reason to.",
    "Yes! If organic chemistry is a required class for whatever you're persuing this is a good course to take. It is much more organized then genchem and the professor is much more helpful.",
    "Most people who take this course have to for graduate school or their major, but overall yes.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with a few caveats. This course is necessary for Pre-Meds, MBB majors, etc. If you're in this class, it's because you have to be. However, that doesn't mean it has to be terrible. DO take this with Professor Elman, he's great and he's helpful. Yes, it was difficult, but he taught it very well. However, DO do the book problems, get help, and sleep before tests. Even minor mistakes dock you all the points on questions, and that was very difficult. Many people went into exams thinking they aced them and came back with low grades due to the harsh grading. At the same time, I see the reason for the harshness. Overall, DO take this course.",
    "Make no mistake, Orgo is a challenge. For any premeds out there, this is a prerequisite, and you're forced into taking it. However, taking it with Ellman is a blessing.",
    "I would recommend this to someone if they had to take it. It's not the most fun\/interesting course in the world (coming from a humanities major), but Prof. Ellman is really really good!",
    "Sure if you wanna learn orgo.",
    "Yes, it's not easy but if you work hard and keep up you'll be fine",
    "Yes, I would. It was very organized and well-taught. Professor Ellman was very patient and clear in his teaching and expectations.",
    "Yes. A great class overall. Lectures are interesting and workload is not bad at all. Very doable with other stem courses or even as a science credit if you're intersted in chem",
    "Yes but only if it makes sense for your major\/interest\/career path. Organic chemistry is not really a class you take for fun like some of the other classes here at Yale.",
    "I would only recommend this course if the other student was pre-med, chemistry or chemical engineering major, or really likes pharmaceuticals. This class is too challenging to take along side other major requirements, where you should spend a majority of your time studying. This class takes too much time away from your other courses if you really want to understand the material. However, if you do not plan on taking this course A-F, or if you do not want to understand the material, then you can put minimal work into it and just know some mechanisms. This class is not for the light-hearted, and if you are gonna take this class, expect a heavy workload (not one that is graded directly, but one that will ultimately determine your grade on the exams). Lots of memorization.",
    "If you're taking orgo it's probably a requirement but that said this course is very well taught and the exams are fair.",
    "I would honestly recommend this class to anybody interested in chemistry at all regardless of major. While it is a premed requirement and therefore is filled with tons of really stressed students, at its base, orgo is a logic and puzzle solving class, which makes it a worthwhile topic to study.",
    "Yes, this course provides a great introduction to organic chemistry.",
    "Yes, organic chemistry is fundamental to premeds and many science majors, and this course does a good job of teaching the basics in a very manageable way.",
    "Yes would definitely recommend taking this course with Professor Ellman. Great class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, but only to those who must take it. It truly is a pre-requisite type of class. One doesn't really need this knowledge in the general world, but if they are going into medicine\/chemistry, it is definitely very important and interesting.",
    "Yes it was a good orgo 1 class.",
    "yes, especially if they need to take it.",
    "Not if you don't have to take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I believe that most people who take it need it as some kind of pre-requisite, but I did genuinely enjoy the course, feel like I learned a lot, and feel like it was taught in a very fair manner.",
    "Of course, don't take this course unless you have to.",
    "Only if you need it.",
    "Yes it was honestly wonderuful.",
    "Yes, I genuinely think this is a good course albeit a challenging one.",
    "If necessary, yes.",
    "If you need this course for major requirements, pre-med requirements, or something else, certainly do it, especially if it's with Professor Ellman.",
    "I would never recommend this course unless you absolutely love chemistry. I only took it as a pre-med requirement.",
    "Yes, it was a great class to take and was well taught.",
    "Yes, its important for premeds.",
    "This course is definitely the hardest class I have ever taken. It is very intellectually challenging, so if you are looking for an insight into how medicine works, or just want to be extremely challenged, then yes!",
    "Yes- but with caution. I would take this class, but be prepared to do a lot of individually-led learning and devote a lot of time to drawing mechanisms\/attending office hours\/really hammering out the concepts on your own.",
    "Seeing as this course is usually only taken by students who have to take the course (i.e. pre-med students, chemistry majors, etc.), I would not so much recommend the course as I would reassure other students that this course is very well taught and is very manageable so long as they stay on top of going to class and doing the practice problems along the way instead of cramming them all into the day before the exam.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course if it is a requirement.",
    "Yes, organic chemistry can be challenging but Ellman makes it very approachable.",
    "Yes! Ellman is a fantastic Professor and its a great intro to organic chemistry",
    "Yes! Ellman is a fun and fantastic professor and there was great support in learning during discussion sections.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those that require it for their major or pre-med. I learned a lot, but I learned very specific chemistry information that I do not see myself using elsewhere unless I were a chemistry major.",
    "Yes, it is probably a requirement, but if you put in the effort the material is interesting and rewarding.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student who has to take it for some requirement.",
    "yes, it is valuable knowledge for those who want to study biological and chemical sciences.",
    "not if it is not mandatory",
    "Yes, any student who is premed has to take it.",
    "Yes; the lectures are very well organized",
    "Yes",

    "Unless you have to take it for your major, please simply refrain for your own good.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is difficult. Organic chemistry is interesting, but it is not always easy to remember everything necessary for reactions. That said, it is a very well-organized course and Professor Ellman is a great lecturer, so regardless of the material, it is a well-taught course.",
    "It's an orgo class. Take it if you need it. Otherwise, why would you?",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to gain more knowledge about chemical reactions",
    "not unless you have to. it ain't fun",
    "Only if you need it.",
    "Yes, because it is a course that challenges critical thinking skills, and is very good at testing your ability to apply knowledge rather than memorize facts and regurgitate them on an exam.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because I learned a lot and became fascinated with the universe and how molecules function.",
    "Yes if you must or enjoy chemistry and puzzling reactions.",
    "Yes, this was my favorite course that I have taken at Yale so far. I loved the topic and I thought Professor Ellman was an amazing professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone in STEM wishing to get a solid foundation in chemistry and quench their curiosity as to why they occur. I didnt have to take it for my major, but chose to take it anyways because I think its important. Of course, I wouldnt recommend this class to someone just looking for a science credit.",
    "No, I would not. Chem 220 is poorly taught and disorganized. Lecture slides are not available online. Exams vary from in-class instruction. You know a class is bad when before the exam, students joke about how they would be happy to get a 60%. This class is a complete embarrassment to Yale and an insult to higher education around the world.",
    "Organic Chemistry isn't exactly something you would take for fun, but also this course was well taught and I would recommend it compared to other introductory chemistry courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are passionate about STEM and the physical sciences. The workload is heavy but it is a rewarding course if you put the time and effort into it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in chemistry and looking to gain a better understanding of how reactions work.",
    "I would say to only take this class if you absolutely have to (i.e. are premed or prevet and can't get away with not taking it).",
    "Most people who take this course take it because they have to, but if you have to learn orgo this course is definitely the best way to do it.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would recommend if people are interested in qualitative chemistry\/organic chemistry.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The course is very well taught and organized so that there is always a clear understanding of what is going on, what is expected on behalf of the student, and how each lesson is related to the previous one and the real world.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if needed for the pre-med or major requirement. I would not take this class for the sake of a science credit.",
    "I wouldn't exactly take this course for fun, but it's definitely the best organized and taught chemistry class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "If you must take it",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! TAKE THIS CLASS! TAKE THIS CLASS! I mean many of you probably have to take it, but you will have the best time ever. Organic chemistry is just so elegant, and if you dont already appreciate it, you will after taking this class, especially with Ellman teaching it. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and it makes me wish that I had taken first-year orgo. I would recommend starting the chemistry requirements for STEM majors\/pre-med with the first-year orgo class. Do yourself a favor and skip general chemistry.",
    "If you have to take this course for premed or your major, there's no choice. But if you're generally interested in chemistry or science this isn't for you.",
    "Not unless it's required. I simply didn't enjoy the course material. It had nothing to do with the structure of the course or people teaching it. Organic chemistry is just very dry and requires a lot of work.",
    "It is a semi-interesting pre-med\/pre-vet requirement class. People that are not required to take it should not take it.",
    "YES. I took general chemistry here at Yale (161\/165) and felt like it was the bane of my existance. I found myself disliking chemistry, and not happy about having to talk another full year of chemistry classes (I am premed). However, Ellman's class proved me wrong. I found this class to be my favorite and honestly enjoyed taking the exams. If you like puzzles, this class is for you! It was so entertaining to take what I learned in class about a mechanism and be able to look at another problem and identify how to solve it. Even if you don't need to take this class, I honestly didn't find the content to be overwhelming. Also, the class is so well structured and I never felt like help wasn't available. This year, a section was offered at 7 pm in WLH, which I thought was so generous since most of the time they are in SCL during the day time. Take this course!",
    "If orgo would be useful to them, I wouldnt advise against it. However, I wouldnt recommend it to someone who just likes chem and is looking for an interesting class.",
    "Yes, especially if they want to learn more about reactions and chemistry.",
    "I would recommend at least orgo I if you are at all interested in chemistry. If not, then only take it if it's a requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, even though most who enter the course do so because of major requirements. This is a course menat for everyone, and though it presents a fair challenge I did not feel like it was daunting. I felt that the resources provided through the textbook reading, Sapling online, and suggested problem sets were adequate preparation for both upcoming lectures and midterm exams. Additionally, I found that the course made organic chemistry seem more applicable and intriguing, which I had not been expecting prior to the course.",
    "Yes, I believe that this class will really introduce you to thinking about chemistry in a different way than you would in gen chem. Also, it's very fun once you actually understand the material being taught.",
    "Although the course is very difficult, if you need to take organic chemistry, I would fully recommend taking it with Prof Ellman. This class was extremely well organized and I feel that I learned a lot.",
    "If you are certain you are science",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "If you like chemistry, you'll like this class! It's at the intersection of biology and inorganic chemistry. Not just memorization, there is also a clear element of understanding. A warning: for many people with organic chemistry, they have it or they don't.",
    "This class probably won't be taken unless someone needs it for their major\/future career choice. Organic chemistry is known for being a weed-out class for students who are in STEM\/pre-med, but this is not the case here. This class is so much better than general chemistry!! Professor Ellman is a fantastic professor who explains everything well plus his practice exams are very useful to see how the midterms\/finals will be. As long as you actually keep up with the material taught, this class isn't that bad.",
    "Not unless required because it is very rigorous and may take additional time to grasp outside of class.",
    "Do not take this class as an easy one. You must work to do well, and if you do work, you will do well. But this is a course that requires not only intense studying on your own, but constant studying.",
    "no",
    "If you like chemistry, yes!"
