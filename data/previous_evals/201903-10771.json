   "comments": [
    "I read a lot of ancient thinkers and got a sense of the reoccurring concepts and themes in ancient Chinese literature\/philosophy.",
    "I came into this class knowing ZERO about ancient Chinese thought and finished with a more or less comprehensive understanding of this field and the messages of key thinkers. I learned how to break from Europen philosophical modes of analysis (yay!) and think about philosophy in different ways - I found the poetry of the Odes to be among the most profound and touching philosophical pieces I have ever read.",
    "Ancient Chinese philosophers and how the fall of the Zhou system prompted thinkers like Kongzi, Laozi, Mozi, Xunzi, etc to create ideal systems of behavior, ritual, etc to create order in society.",
    "I developed a good understanding of the earliest traditions of ancient chinese literature, philosophy, and religious tradition.",
    "How to read ancient texts from both a philosophy and literature perspective Understanding common themes and ideas in ancient Chinese texts Write a short paper (2-3 pages) and strike that perfect amount of idea (this was still a work in progress by the time class ended) Discuss various interpretations of texts and use the texts to back up said discussions",
    "While certain ancient Chinese works always inspired a hushed awe in me, both because of their style and seminal importance, Mick's class inspired me to think critically and challenge both the official propagation of certain works, and the ideas put forth in them. While in this class we did question these ancient ideals, Mick also inspired respect for the ancient Chinese thinkers and their works, which was of great value to me and to students in our class who hadn't encountered ancient Chinese philosophy before. Mick inspired me to rethink the meaning of philosophy and its intersection with literature, as well as introducing me to some of my new favorite texts like the Zhuangzi. This was absolutely my favorite class I have ever taken, reminding me why I want to study East Asian thought in the first place.",
    "Understanding the way ancient Chinese tradition grapples with question of legitimacy, wisdom, and truth. This course offers a rare comparative with the much more familiar Western philosophical tradition, and I've learnt how the two traditions diverge; particularly in their treatment of ancient wisdom and the blurred lines between philosophy, literature, and religion.",
    "Learned a lot more about Chinese philosophy, which offered a very different perspective from the western philosophers.",
    "A better understanding of the development of thought and perspective throughout the China."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I really liked how the class was structured as a lecture\/seminar hybrid. The readings were never over-bearing and our class meetings were always fun. The midterm and final were reasonable. Weaknesses: None - though I would like to make a suggestion that maybe instead of having 4 2-page papers we could like like 2 2-page papers and maybe 1 longer one because I had some ideas I would have liked to explore, but the 2-page limit made it quite difficult to do so to the extent I would have liked to",
    "Strengths: Some material was very interesting like reading Hanfeizi and Mengzi. Weaknesses: But most material was dense and boring. It's extremely difficult to read 70 pages of material for every class.",
    "This class is strongest in the group discussions of individual pieces. I think that more time could be dedicated to considering specific questions for each reading.",
    "Strengths: this is one of the only classes Ive seen the leminar format work really well for Hunter knows how to facilitate a thought provoking discussion that gives students freedom to explore their own ideas while also providing crucial context. Ancient Chinese texts convey their message in a vastly different way from the Western canon, so thats fascinating. Weakness: yes, theres work involved. But doing the readings and discussion posts are worth it to come engaged to class.",
    "Prof Hunter is a superb seminar leader, and his passion for the class shines through. The TA for the class, Nate, also contributes to make the class environment really positive and productive. One weakness could be the volume of readings assigned; with so much breadth it is sometimes hard to follow the syllabus religiously.",
    "The course is very in depth. Prof is very good at teaching the material.",
    "A very engaging teaching style yet also allowed ample time for discussion. I think it would have been more beneficial to have the final and midterms set up in a more concept-based manner."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! It's listed as a lecture, but Prof. Hunter teaches it like a seminar. He's a very organized instructor and a good facilitator of discussion. The readings were long, but interesting, and classes were always engaging. The course is not a gut, but it's manageable; the workload is predictable, and the regular reading reflections and essays are short.",
    "YES! This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale. The amount you learn and the exact nature of what you learn is something that no other course can quite give you on this campus. If I want to learn about Kant or Plato there are about a bajillion courses that will teach you this, but how many classes will put the Odes in conversation with Confucious (Kongzi to professor Hunter), or Laozi in conversation with a structural work like the Annals of Lu Buwei? Basically, this class is incredible.",
    "If you're a strong Philosophy\/ East Asian Studies major or if you're taking this class Credit\/D THIS IS NOT A GUT",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in ancient but non-western philosophy, as well as someone interested in the history of early China.",
    "If you want to learn about the foundations of Chinese thought, or look at texts unlike those of Ancient Greece or Europe, absolutely. This is Hunters bread and butter course and youll learn a lot from it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! This course will challenge you while giving you some incredibly useful skills for the future, including developing your critical thinking and textual analysis. There is quite a bit of reading and biweekly written responses but the workload is not too much and forces you to continuously engage with the texts.",
    "Definitely! There is a dearth of East Asian philosophy classes here at Yale, and Prof Hunter's Ancient Chinese Thought class provides a valuable introduction to the tradition, especially with the consideration of how \"philosophy\" just doesn't cut it in describing ancient Chinese thought. The syllabus is flexible to the interests of the class, yet has unity of salient themes that will allow one to better appreciate philosophy outside the Western tradition, and potentially embark on deeper study in this one.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. While the workload was, on occasion, substantial, it never failed to be intellectually stimulating."
