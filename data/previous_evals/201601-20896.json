   "comments": [
    "Yes, would recommend!",
    "I would recommend this to another student; I finally saw progress at the end of the course. I liked how small the class was; it was the most one-on- one teaching experience that I've had at Yale.",
    "This was an amazing course I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in drawing even if they have zero experience. This class makes you engage in a type of thinking that I think carries over into any line of study during your time at Yale and is also a relaxed class and fun one to have taken at some point during your four years. I can't really think of any weaknesses for the course. NATALIE IS AMAZING so definitely try and get in her section. The work load was also really manageable. There were usually short projects due during the week and then some longer projects where you had he weekend work. But the workload was always balanced and we even got some weekends off.",
    "Take this class if you get in even if you, like me, are not an art major but are still passionate and committed to improving your art. Professor Westbrook-DeYoung's class is a lot of time and effort and I usually spent 6-12 hours a week outside of class working on assignments, but it was absolutely worth it. Get ready to freehand strait smooth lines while varying your line weight because you can't erase china marker (trust me, I tried). Class is small and great with lots of critiques and feedback and you will leave the class knowing some amazing artists and with a substantial portfolio of work under your arm (or over your head. Some of it gets pretty big).",
    "I came into Basic Drawing intending to address bad habits that I had picked up after several years of drawing and painting on my own (namely, drawing from photographs rather than observation). After researching each ART 114 professors teaching style, I decided to take Natalies class since she seemed to provide the most formal and rigorous foundation for observational drawing. For those of you shopping this class with lots of drawing experience under your belt, dont underestimate the value of returning to the basics. What I found particularly powerful about Natalies approach to teaching was the way she structured her lessons and assignments in a way that layered each skill, each technique, and each thought to show us how incredibly rich and complex art can be. So much thought goes behind a work of art, and I think its easy to dismiss that fact as you become more comfortable with your own style and more critical of others, but this class reminded me to approach art with humility, to never make assumptions about another persons art, and to make your own work with intentionality. While the workload gets pretty heavy at the end of the semester (dont procrastinate on the final project!), I highly recommend this class to new and seasoned student-artists alike.",
    "I took it spring semester of my senior year as a non-art major, and it was a refreshing break from my previous workload. If you feel like you have time (maybe 2 to 4 hours a week), you should definitely take this class (for Cr\/D)."
