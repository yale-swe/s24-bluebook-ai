   "comments": [
    "ABET MechEs are stuck with it - but really, it's not that bad. Take Professor Brown seriously when he says he wants short reports - it will make your life so much better. Brown is a great guy, so take this with him.",
    "Expect poor grades on all the reports - and unpredictability as to the amount of time needed for each report. They are supposed to be \"short\" but can't be because of the information needed within each one. The class is fun itself, but a huge time burden and a bit of a pain after some time.",
    "It's a lot of work but it's one of the most useful classes you'll take in the ABET program, especially if you're interested in doing research. Professor Brown is awesome, and he makes an inevitably painful experience as painless as possible.",
    "Meng 363L is a lot of work. We had tech reports every week and the data analysis could take a while. The reports were not extremely long as what was stressed was drawing good quality conclusions from data rather than writing huge papers. The class was taught excellently and the professor made sure we all did well, but the workload is not trivial.",
    "Probably have to take it, but if you don't, and want a good class (lot of work though) take it! It's really a good class and will teach you a lot about fluid dynamics and technical writing",
    "A lot of work, but one of the few engineering classes where you can actually see your writing improve. As long as you come to class and lab and put conscious effort into your lab reports and improving them each week, you'll do fine.",
    "Prof. Brown is suuuuuper reasonable, I know this class looks kind of horrifying but he's all about 4-page lab reports (I mean, it's hard to condense them to 4 pages but it doesn't really matter) That and you get to make solar cells and mess around with fuel cells and do a little presentation at the end. The labs themselves can be pretty fun if you don't stress over them. You'll get a chance to improve your lab reports; your first few can be terrible and it doesn't matter. You're probably only taking this if you're MechE. So yeah. Take it and don't stress about it! It's gonna take a lot of your time, but it will all be fine in the end. And Prof. Brown is the COOLEST and you'll like him. He's also very understanding and willing to give extensions. If you don't have to take it, though, you probably shouldn't. It's a lab report per week for like 12 weeks and at times you will hate everything."
