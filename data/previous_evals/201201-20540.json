    "I will recommend it to other students.",
    "Do it, do it, do it. Xiao-Jing is fantastic and you learn a LOT",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Prof Wang really does an exceptional job of covering a tremendous range of fascinating material. The problem sets consisted of building matlab simulations that modeled the different computational systems of the brain. I really enjoyed them. One of the greatest parts of the class is the grading structure. Since the course covers so much ground, a cumulative exam would have been brutal. Instead we were primarily evaluated on our problem sets and research, making it a lot less stressful. I am an undergraduate in computer science and it was a really great experience to take a course which provided me with so many useful and fascinating perspectives on the mind that I would never have gotten in an undergraduate course.",
    "I would highly recommend NBIO 582 to another student. This is a very mature class in that the classroom atmosphere is fairly laid back and students are expected to take the time to really learn the material themselves. For many of the homeworks, students are given a hearty push in the right direction but are then forced to think their way out of unfamiliar problems and unexpected results. The class is an exhilarating challenge because of how many different fields it incorporates: I realized that though I had the background necessary in computer science, math, psychology, neuroscience, biology, etc. to understand most of the material, the real challenge (and rewarding part of the class) came in trying to bring these diverse fields together at the same time. I wish there were an advanced course to take now that its over!",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in systems neuroscience, computational neuroscience, or cognitive psychology.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "A little bit hardcore, but really helpful.I would definitely recommend this class to other students. In fact I have already done so. The class is a good complement to experimentalist like me. It is both good to do excise your brain and to gain some new knowledge."

    "It helped a lot in my own research.",
    "This course essentially played a large part in convincing me to apply (eventually) to graduate school for computational neuroscience! An invaluable experience!",
    "This course provided me with some of the tools necessary for understanding the activity of single neurons and populations of neurons in generating rich physiology and behavior.",
    "It introduces the research methodology of neuroscience to me. It's more of opening a view to me rather than contributing to my phD work.",
    "The quantitative perspective is very important. By taking this class, I think I grow a better sense of what does many numbers mean in the result."
