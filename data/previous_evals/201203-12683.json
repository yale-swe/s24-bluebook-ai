    "Take it. It's fun.",
    "If you want to learn how to read and write Arabic this is definitely a class that will help you with that. If you wish to become fluent you will have to take more than just L3 due to the fact that we learn modern standard Arabic which nobody actually speaks in real life (other than newscasters). So continue on to L4 and L5 if you want to become fluent because L3 is not enough.",
    "If you are at the point at which you are taking 130 it means that you want to learn Arabic. If you want to learn Arabic then absolutely take it. If Arabic isn't your thing then be aware of it because even though this isn't a huge commitment, it is a commitment nonetheless.",
    "This is a great course! Prof. El-Bousty leads friendly, interesting discussions and does an excellent job of explaining new vocabulary and elaborating new grammar rules. Homework and assessments are totally manageable and often fun, and the material is an easy, natural step up from what was covered in L2. If you're frustrated with the way Arabic is taught at Yale, try to hold out until you can take L3 with Prof. El-Bousty -- this was the first semester that actually felt productive, that made me feel as if I'd accomplished something major in my study of the language, that left me looking forward with great anticipation to L4 and beyond.",
    "Yes!Arabic is a challenging language, but if you really want to learn it, take the class. It is taught well (especially is you have Professor Elbousty). Also, because it is a small department, the class size is small and you will get individual attention from your professor."
