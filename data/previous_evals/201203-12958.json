   "comments": [
    "The best part of this class was the makeup of the class. Being surrounded by other people that love politics and history is fascinating, and it makes for great discussions. The readings were dry and long at times, and there isn't that much incentive to read them fully. Not a lot of work, either - three papers and the readings.",
    "Take it!! An amazing class with really great readings and a professor that's great at leading class discussions. Lots of reading, but paper workload is minimal.",
    "Definitely, definitely recommend to anyone who is even remotely interested in politics, and especially to those who are not sure what they believe. The class has really scintillating and thought provoking discussion every day.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings through which you approach the topic of Liberalism and Conservatism are very interesting. It's great to be able to discuss these topics in a seminar setting as a freshman. You also get to go into the archives to do research which is really cool.",
    "I would recommend Libs\/Cons only for a very specific student. I think that it was a really good class, but did not meet my expectations. I expected it to be tied a lot more to the present, and into politcal science. Let me be very clear. THIS IS A HISTORY CLASS. It is not poli-sci. We were not allowed to discuss the value of an author's ideas, we had to discuss what cuased each author to think what he did, and how it related to other authors we had read. This really agrivated me, as I cared more about the actual policies they were discussing.",
    "Take it!",
    "A great freshman seminar for someone interested in politics, history or American culture. The class makes you aware of the fantastic resources for historical research available at Yale. Additionally, the three papers give you a diverse array of writing styles to become familiar with for future college classes.",
    "History 029 is I really like this course! We read really interesting material and our discussions went in depth. Even though our class was mostly left-leaning we had a surprising amount of disagreement and fluidity. Once we got into the readings, there wasn't too much superficial political jargon, but instead, thought-through comments. The only weakness of this class is the difficulty of speaking in it. Most people, unless very vocal, only spoke 1 or 2 times in the class, so it puts a lot of pressure on you to make what you are saying good. Still, I would recommend this class, for anyone who wants to learn about the foundations of conservative and liberal thought in this country. However, remember it is a history class, and the professor did NOT go into current material very much.",
    "Hist 029 is a crash course through both primary and secondary readings regarding the American political spectrum, as well as an ample introduction to the university's historical resources. Definitely take it if you're passionate about the subject matter. If you're not, you'll find the readings far too dense to finish, and the papers far too involved to write. I was somewhere in the middle, and definitely felt both challenged and uplifted by this course. Some readings were boring, some were amazing. And historical research, especially guided by Prof. Gage, was some of the most fun classwork I've ever done.",
    "I would recommend it. Many of the readings were fascinating, and all were worthwhile; our class discussions were lively and thoughtful; and all three assignments were interesting and useful (I'd now feel much more comfortable writing a history paper for another class). I learned a lot about the broad political trends of the 20th century -- an area my high-school history classes neglected.Professor Gage is an expert on 20th-century American history, and she's also incredibly nice and eager to help her students. She took us to visit Yale libraries and explained the protocols of primary-source research, and I left the seminar feeling able to tackle a more-advanced history course in the future.",
    "If you like American politics, TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "HIST 029 is a course that studies the progression from liberal New Deal thought to conservative thoughts of \"Morning in America\" under President Reagan. I would encourage students interested in American politics and history to take this course as it is engaging and interesting."
