    "Chinese 151 is a great continuation of the Chinese track here. If you've taken some before, you already know that the teachers are great and the course is intense, but you'll learn what you came to learn as best you can at Yale. The News unit at the end is great and a nice change of pace!",
    "I would recommend the class if you're still interested in learning and improving your Chinese. Even when it seems like you're not making as much progress in this class as you were in your first year, you are learning a whole lot more important and specialized vocabularies as well as being introduced to traditional characters and newspaper diction. Imagine being able to read Taiwanese street signs and newspaper short blurbs after the course!",
    "Not nearly as interesting as 150 in my opinion but I guess no real reason not to take it. At this point I feel like I can keep teaching myself Chinese without a class which is good, I also feel somewhat comfortable reading newspapers online although I don't understand every word which is a significant step.",
    "Yeah I would. It's a rewarding class that will take up a lot of your time but will really improve your chinese in a way that I never think CHNS 150 did.",
    "I thought CHNS 151 was a much better course than its predecessor, CHNS 150. The vocabulary and grammar in the spring semester course is more pertinent and relevant to students who seek to learn Chinese and apply it to future employment opportunities in China. Additionally, you finally begin to learn how to read newspapers, which is extremely difficult but extremely rewarding all at once.After 150, many students feel as though they've hit plateaus in their Chinese education and can't learn anymore. 151 does a good part of pushing students onward, such that I actually feel like I improved a great deal over the course of the semester, and eventually got past my plateau.",
    "Chinese 151 is a fantastic advanced Chinese class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Bear in mind that learning a language outside of an immersive environment is hard. Chinese is particularly hard because of the characters.This class will, however, increase your ability to read characters to the extent that you can read news articles and to an extent other materials in Chinese.Speaking out with new vocabulary and grammar structures is sometimes scary, but just keep taking risks. Remember that making mistakes out loud is always a good thing because you learn from it.",
    "a Yes, I would take Chinese 151 because Wang Laoshi and Li Laoshi are great."
