   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this even if you are not a BME major. If you have a genuine interest in biomaterials and their applications, the information is really easy to comprehend outside of the BME major.",
    "I would highly recommend this class even for people not going into biomedical engineering.",
    "I think overall this is one of the better electives in the major. The material is not very difficult by itself, but the class is sometimes made difficult by the lecture style and slides. Don't know how the class is graded (hopefully leniently) because there was never a curve or mean announced. Workload was not too bad, 3 easy Psets, 2 midterms, final, and easy presentation.",
    "Good elective to take for BME major. There are 3 homework assignments, a presentation, 2 tests and a final. The exams are sometime a little too specific but overall will come out with a basic understanding of biomaterials. The textbooks are not that helpful, one is gigantic and super dense but not reading them thoroughly is not really necessary to do well in the class.",
    "This is a fun course. I would recommend it. Not that much work and you learn a lot of interesting information.",
    "If you are interested in biomaterials, or are looking for lighter course for bme major, I recommend this course. Professor Gonzalez is really nice and cares about the students and their learning experience.",
    "This is a great BENG elective and I would recommend it to another student. It has a manageable workload and the material is very interesting. This is a great introductory course to the topic of biomaterials.",
    "It is a good BME elective. If you are interested in biomaterials, I think you should definitely take it!",
    "Biomaterials is a wonderful class. If you're interested in what materials are being used in biomedical devices, definitely take it. Professor Gonzalez is a wonderful teacher. Also, the exams are definitely much fairer than most other STEM classes. The exams are also graded a bit easier than you'd expect, so don't freak out if you think you didn't do too great. The readings are pretty hefty. Definitely look through the ones in the Introduction to Materials Science book more carefully but the ones in the huge Biomaterials textbook can be skimmed a bit more lightly. Especially when there's a lot assigned.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class! The material is very applicable to most BME majors. Professor Gonzalez is a wonderful professor-- very enthusiastic and knowledgeable!",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. I didn't feel like i learned a whole lot, and there are probably a lot better BME electives available. The class itself is not too bad workwise with 3 psets, two midterms and a final. However, it is very disorganized and just hectic. The lectures and notes are very messy and hard to gather information form. Furthermore, if you are a senior, I would think twice about taking this class, as you likely have interviews for grad school or jobs. If you miss class, you are at a disadvantage, as much of the necessary info is not in the uploaded slides but was written on the board or mentioned in class.",
    "This is a good survey course, but nothing more. You'll come out with a decent and pretty useful knowledge of biomaterials and their applications, but it's a bit superficial at times. I was disappointed because the first few lectures during shopping period were fantastic and the course had great reviews, but I found the rest of the class pretty dry. On the flip side, it's a pretty light workload. Test questions are out of left field sometime.",
    "This class is what you make of it. You can learn a ton by doing all the reading and do OK by only reviewing the class notes.",
    "The in class lectures are the most important part.",
    "Fun, relatively easy, interesting class for anyone who has shown interested in biomaterials. There is no demand for previous knowledge in biomaterials or advanced physiology knowledge. I took this course as an MCDB major, and I found this class very easy to follow.",
    "Absolutely a recommended course. This course covers a wide array of materials and different types of material properties. It is a good survey course in different biomaterials, covering both fundamentals of material science and specific applications. There's some math but it's not challenging.",
    "An interesting, relevant and current exploration of materials science, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Professor Gonzalez is an instructor you don't want to miss- and the course material is accessible even if you are not a BME major. Tests are totally fair but long so expect a slight time crunch- but if you know your stuff, you'll be fine.",
    "Yes, take this class. The material is average in terms of difficulty, the class doesn't require a ton of work, and the professor is amazing. You should do most of the reading, but there isn't a ton if you know how to spread it out and pick what's important.",
    "This is a great course that covers the basics of materials science, as well as the different classes of materials used in biological systems. I would recommend it for those interested in materials science, biomaterials, and biomedical engineering.",
    "This is a nice course. Exams are fair, and there is not an excessive amount of work. Plus, I think this is helpful basic knowledge for engineers.",
    "BENG 434 is a thorough overview of the physical and chemical components of biocompatible materials with relevant case-studies and guest lectures mixed in. Professor Gonzalez is an enthusiastic lecturer who is always willing to explain difficult topics to you after class. Just make sure to take advantage of office hours. The problem sets are pertinent to the course and help you study for the tests. I would totally recommend to another student, especially someone interested in biomechanics, because the course teaches material selection and analysis."
