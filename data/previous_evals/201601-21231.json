    "Such a large amount of work for only half a credit. And so much of it feels like busy work unless you are incredibly passionate about the body plans of invertebrates or the life cycles of gymnosperms vs angiosperms. That said, if you need a bio lab, it's not a terrible lab to take. We don't learn a lot of useful info, but we do get to do some cool things, like determine the anatomical composition of different kinds of fruit and then EAT THE FRUIT! And you get to go wading around in a stream collecting samples to analyze back in the classroom for invertebrate life. And you get to look at a bunch of birds from the Peabody. I wouldn't say it's worth the amount of work though, with weekly lab reports, weekly quizzes, and occasional notebook checks. Ultimately, take it if you need to.",
    "This lab is a fun dissection class if you like hands-on things, but the specimen can be gross if you're not into that. I would recommend if you need a bio lab.",
    "Relatively easy lab about forms of life on earth. Much lower work load than many other lab courses but also very interesting! Perfect for animal lovers \/ people who like watching nature documentaries.",
    "Fun lab class with a TON of work. Nice alternative to other \"typically pre-med\" bio labs, although it is less medicine-focused than some other labs you could take, which might be more productive. The lab classes themselves are pretty fun, but be prepared to write long, arduous lab reports--they are death if you start the night before. Definitely should be worth more than 1\/2 credit considering how much time I put into them.",
    "It is not an easy course, you have to put in a lot of effort. Even then, it's still tedious. Not sure if it's worth the grade. I don't recommend this for premeds. Take another course.",
    "You basically just learn about diversity in many areas of the tree of life (invertebrates, fish, birds, flowing plants, trees. etc.), and get to look at cool specimens. A reasonable amount of work & isn't attached to a class - take note, pre-meds looking for bio labs!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Especially if you need a lab credit for pre-med or something. This is by far the best biology lab you're gonna get at Yale, and it involves so many fun experiences that it's worth it in spite of the semi-annoying lab reports. You learn so much about different flora and fauna, and you manage to have lots of fun. Try to get some of your friends to take it with you, because it's quite the experience and it's good to have friends around.",
    "I would summarize this course as a fun bio lecture and a great way to learn about the animal phyla and plants. I would recommend it to other student.",
    "I found the class very interesting. Each lab would be 2 to 3 hours long, and we would either look at organisms in the microscope, dissect organisms, look at animals, examine plants, or learn about other cool things. Be warned, however, that the labs each week are very long. Even though previous semesters have evaluated this course to have a low workload, the semester was different in that labs often took a few hours to write except for the first one, which was short. Many of my friends who took the class with me around the class tedious and burdensome, even though I actually found myself enjoying the class and learning a lot. The quizzes are also tricky. They test you on details on the lab hand out and sometimes we would not do very well on them. Overall, I found the class to be a great learning experience.",
    "A fantastic stand alone bio lab. No doubt the most enjoyable bio lab one could take at Yale. Even for people who don't need the credit I would still recommend!",
    "class which can be fun at times, tedious at others",
    "This labs workload is actually worth a half credit. The topics are very interesting and Marta is a great professor.",
    "Overall, this course is extremely enjoyable. Sometimes, the work is more than you would expect (often busy work) and I wish that it was a full credit class, but the work lightens up throughout the year. And the labs get progressively more fun as well!",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a biology lab. The class has a relatively light workload (although a few of the reports are rather lengthy) and we take several field trips, which makes from a nice break from normal lab work. This is easily the most enjoyable lab course I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class!",
    "It's a great lab to take. I took it as a premed and really enjoyed it. It is a great lab because it's taught by an awesome professor, it is fun, and it is not too difficult. The workload is much less compared to other labs.",
    "Parts of this lab are fun, but overall it's pretty miserable.",
    "Easy class, but there is a large volume of tedious busy work assigned which is very unpleasant to complete. This felt like a high school class in that the assignments were arbitrary and required no thought--but there are a large number of them. I found completing the work for this class very unpleasant.",
    "An exquisite lab that gives you a broad exposure to evolution and diversity, starting from prokaryotes and working your way up to plants, vertebrates, and finally ecosystems. I've never had so much fun in a lab course. Some highlights from the semester: dissecting a 3 ft long catfish complete with all the guts and bloody glory, dissecting flowers, discussing fruit anatomy, and stuffing our faces with tamarind, guava, lychee, and durian at Marsh Botanical Gardens, hiking Sleeping Giant to measure freshwater streams biodiversity (get ice cream afterwards!!!), and literally hugging trees in order to collect data for Yale Nature Walk. Thanks to Marta, I'll never be able to go outdoors without subconsciously categorizing all the plants as monoecious or dicot, without thinking of the birds and the bees (in terms of its pollination syndrome \/ dispersal strategies), and honestly we're all the better for it because seeing such diversity in life forms grants you a truly profound appreciation for nature. If you're premed and not an EEB major, this course will make your brain explode with joy to realize that biology can operate on a macro level, outside of petri dishes and genes and metabolic pathways, that is just as fascinating and worthy of your consideration.",
    "Take it! It's an amazing course and worth your time. Not too hard, and you learn a lot.",
    "This is a very easy bio credit.",
    "I would completely recommend E&EB 223L to my fellow students. It was a great introductory lab for learning about the diversity of life. The labs were fun and informative, and Professor Wells and the TFs were amazing! I really loved the tree project. It was enjoyable and taught me a great deal about my tree\/nature. After I the project (and the class), I found myself more aware of the natural world around me, which I love!",
    "Overall good lab and Marta is fantastic. Lab reports can get really long and tedious though but overall I would recommend this course especially if you need another bio lab for premed.",
    "This is a great biology lab to take.",
    "Wonderful exposure to E&EB. Highly recommend!",
    "Probably the best bio lab at Yale. Take it!",
    "Would recommend!"
