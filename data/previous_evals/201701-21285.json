    "Improved my fluency in Chinese, especially more formal registers and literary language.",
    "This is the most impressive chinese language program in the country. I learned more chinese than i could have anywhere else. Professors Wang and Zhang are a perfect balance of rigor and kindness."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: consistent practice, engaged people and teachers Weakness: hard to notice significant improvement",
    "The timing of the homework felt a big rough towards the end. Particularly, the skit was very stressful around finals time.",
    "Daily homework workload has been a lot better than the fall semester, due to the changes in the quiz. I feel like we got to speak a little more this semester too (maybe that was because of the small class size of my section?), and the elimination of translation\/traditional character was very efficient. Generally very well structured course, and you have a lot of chances to get detailed feedback.",
    "The course is excellent; I can't think of any major changes to make. Maybe the only small thing to change would be to make the oral test questions and the TF tutorial session questions more free response rather than just summarizing the textbook. The changes made to the course structure this semester (such as changed quiz format, essay assignments, oral test format) were all much better than last semester and should be continued."
