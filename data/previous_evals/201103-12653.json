    "Professor Lalli is knowledgeable and hilarious. Take this class! But make sure if you do, that you prepare your rep before coachings and classtime. If you fail to do this, you will have to stumble through it anyway at the expense of your dignity.",
    "Take it! He's amazingly knowledgable. (Able to tell you what words and notes you got wrong on that obscure German lied without any music in front of him because he knows them all so well.) Great repertoire suggestions, and a great way to just spend more time performing with and for each other. Amazing dinners at his house in the middle and end of each semester!",
    "Great class, Lalli makes a real effort to make the class interesting and create performance opportunities.",
    "If you sing classically as a soloist, take this class. Your will get to perform in master class often, for your peers and Professor Lalli, which is the best experience you can get at Yale. You will also get weekly coaching with the lovely Sara Kohane, who is an amazing accompanist."
