   "comments": [
    "You have to take 430 at some point. Iachello is dedicated and adorable. Sometimes I found the notation in this class confusing, and sometimes the class moved at too slow a pace. I would have liked problem set questions to be assigned from questions that weren't in the book.The midterm was easy, but the average was apparently a 21.8\/30, which, on Iachello's grading scale, may be a C. 40% of the final grade is homework, which is nice. However, there isn't much room for error, so make sure that you do well on the midterm and the psets.",
    "E&M is required for the physics major, but I would recommend against taking it with Iachello. He is one of the worst professors I have had at Yale (and that says a lot). The material was not presented clearly, and he gave no physical intuition to understand what was going on. He would spent 50 minutes with his back to the class writing on the board, and only gave unintuitive mathematical derivations for what was going on. I would recommend taking it with another professor, or possibly trying to take the class in applied physics. The assignments for this class were extremely pointless and did not emphasize the knowledge we had 'learned.'",
    "It's standard undergraduate E&M. The level of difficulty was disappointing as there are some very interesting problems in E&M that were not covered. The exams were just problems out of Griffiths. Hint: once you know what chapters will be the focus of the exams, do practice problems out of the book, and if you're lucky, you'll get some overlap.",
    "It's a tough class, but you're probably taking it because it's required. Read the textbook as you go along, don't leave it all till exam studying time.",
    "If you need to learn E&M, you'll learn the material, but I wasn't a huge fan of the class. The grading was very generous (40% homework, and he graded leniently on the tests), but there was no curve (90% was the cutoff for an A). A little confusing, and not as inspiring as some of my other physics classes.",
    "The course isn't outstanding, but it's probably something any physics student should take.",
    "If you're a physics major, it's probably required for you. I wouldn't take it otherwise... Essentially it covers everything in the Griffiths Electrodynamics book. Homework and exam questions were all from Griffiths too. The class also moves at a really fast pace, so it can be difficult to keep up.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend 430 to those not majoring in Physics in that the class is fairly dull trek through Griffiths\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the course literally is simply covering all chapters of the textbook. This being said, E&M is a fascinating and useful subject, and it might just be a good course to take to force you to really learn it rigorously. Iachello is a nice guy and engaging lecturer, but he simply just covered the textbook without adding anything, which made class a bit dull at times. Also, beware that the material gets much more difficult at the end (as the Griffiths book does), and what begins with trivial vector calculus and electrostatics will become very complicated and hard to piece together in the final discussions of topics such as wave guides, retarded potential and radiation.",
    "If you have to take it take it. The material is not particularly easy, but there are certainly harder courses out there. You'll spend a few hours a week on problem sets (usually not more than 4 or 5, if that) plus some time reaffirming all the stuff from the lectures. However, the class covers a lot of somewhat scattered material and moves pretty fast, so if you don't already have some good background in E&Mand multivariable calc, this class probably is not for you.",
    "No. Iachello is a nice person, but his lectures are very disorganized. He took everything word for word from Griffiths, but glossing over important concepts. On the bright side, even his exams were taken from Griffiths, so all you have to do to pass is memorize the textbook. We crammed all 12 chapters of Griffiths in one semester and didn't get any formula sheets for the exams. Studying for exams was brutal. But at least the grading was very generous.",
    "Don't take it if you don't need to. You learn nothing from lecture and have to teach yourself everything. however, hws are short and everything is online, so there is very little motivation to learn. With that said, you need it for the Physics Int major, so just bear it out and don't wait until the end to learn it all.",
    "Standard EM course. Uses Griffiths, which is very standard. Lectures followed book closely, so reading was important while lectures were somewhat less important.",
    "Take it if you have to. Lectures are unnecessary. I think I went to less than 5 all semester."
