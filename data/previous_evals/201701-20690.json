   "comments": [
    "Mostly knowledge (not many skills or insights, per se) about Canada and its incredibly interesting history. That knowledge was not really applied in any substantive way in class discussions or the writing assignment, which was totally unrelated.",
    "I learned a ton about Quebec and Canada, covering an enormous period of history ranging from pre-Conquest to effectively the present",
    "I gained insight into the history of Quebec and Canada during the period covered by the class.",
    "- a lot about Canadian history, something I knew almost nothing about beforehand - how to integrate untraditional primary sources - Canada is a really cool country! - French North American history is fascinating!",
    "Professor Gitlin was so passionate about the subject area that it made me love it! I particularly enjoyed that although the specific topic was Quebec & Canada, we went into the broader history of Franco North America in order to gain a foundation for later francophone history.",
    "This course opened up a new historical world and view of North America. It was an entirely exhilarating and rich experience. Though the course topic may seem obscure at first glance, it is fascinating and altogether relevant, at once on a historical level, political level, and sociological level."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course's strength if Professor Gitlin's encyclopedic knowledge, warmth, engaging personality, and passion for the subject matter. Its weaknesses are disorganization, repetitive discussions in class, excessive amounts of disjointed facts that are impossible to assemble into something coherent or digestible.",
    "This course teaches an interesting history, but it doesn't always feel particularly intellectually rigorous. Professor Gitlin tends to lecture a decent amount, and he is very kind, but there isn't much student discussion.",
    "Gitlin is totally devoted to this class and oozes enthusiasm and makes sure all students are involved and committed. He does a great job of adding Canadian and French elements to the class-even leading our class on a field trip to a French-Canadian restaurant. I loved that Dean B of Davenport assisted in teaching the course since he did a wonderful job of adding a Louisiana perspective. I think the course would be improved if he taught an even larger portion of the course or co-taught it with Gitlin. I wish that the reading was more closely tied to the course or that when the students summarize the readings for the course by outlining it, they had a chance to talk about it in class. I also think that the paper could be made more up front and centeras a history major who has taken many history seminars, I was prepared to write a primary source research paper, but not all students are that equipped.",
    "I think that though it was a seminar, there was a bit more lecturing involved than I expected. Having it just largely be a lecture at times made the seminar time drag from time to time, and I also wished that we could have engaged in further class discussion about many of the readings. The readings, while interesting, often weren't talked about much in class beyond looking at the facts they presented (particularly with the earlier ones).",
    "This course has many strengths. It is taught by an engaging professor who is very knowledgable and passionate about the subject. The course material is interesting and varied. One feels by the end that this history is important and interesting to learn about. However, Professor Gitlin talked for too long during each seminar and did not allow for enough student engagement. This put a real damper on the course, for me, as very little was asked or expected of the students during each class. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I could have spoken more often in class. If this were the case, I would have been more invested in completing the readings and getting to know my classmates. Given that I rarely got to hear my classmates speak, I feel that I don't really know any of them better than I did before this semester, which is a shame, because one of the greatest joys of Yale for me has been the opportunity to meet interesting people, be it in my classes or otherwise.",
    "Professor Gitlin is a wonderful teacher who has a lot of knowledge to share about the subject. His seminars can feel a bit lecture-heavy and can run over, so student participation isn't as encouraged as it is in some of the other seminars I've taken. That said, I greatly enjoyed the course it was a very relaxed environment that still facilitated student learning.",
    "I really liked the course and how Professor Gitlin expertly balanced discussion with his quasi-lecture style.",
    "This course provides students with a general timeline of Canadian history, alongside a cultural and social look at the history of the French in North America. Professor Gitlin does a fabulous job at incorporating a wide variety of sources into the syllabus, which contains really exciting pieces. I wish we would have talked more about the readings in class, though.",
    "So great, would recommend to anyone.",
    "I love how much Professor Gitlin made us into a family. I always felt comfortable in class and enjoyed how he changed up our modes of learning among film clips, discussion, lectures, and trips.",
    "This course was engaging from start to finish. Seminars varied-- not only in terms of subject matter, but also in terms of discussion style. On some days interlocutors led class, while on others, Professor Gitlin took the reins, pushing us to think about the material and implications of Canadian history on a deeper, sociological level. I often left class in a daze-- a natural response to the controversial topics and attending questions posed in the seminar. It was all quite stirring. On occasion, guest speakers joined us in seminar, which was always a fantastic addition. The only potential weakness of the course that comes to mind relates to the amount of material packed in. There was never enough time to discuss everything, or to discuss the more important events and topics of the course for as long as we might have liked. But that is often how history courses go... and I guess it left us all hankering for more, which is never a bad thing."

   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in Canada, definitely take this course. I was someone who read the reviews and thought it would be worth taking with little to no interest in Canada but a strong interest in taking a class with Professor Gitlin. If that's you, be careful. I ultimately regret taking this class largely because the content did not capture my attention and, while I love Prof. G, I had a difficult time following his talks and general structure of the course.",
    "This course teaches an interesting history, but it doesn't always feel particularly intellectually rigorous. Professor Gitlin tends to lecture a decent amount, and he is very kind, but there isn't much student discussion.",
    "Yes, with the understanding that you will cover Quebec and Canada for the entire semester, mostly focused on the 20th century. Also, be aware that you need to be super on top of the paper on your ownyou will not get guidance on it in class. Other than that, it is a wonderful class and enjoyable to be in! Prof Gitlin is incredibly committed to the course and is crazy knowledgeable and I always enjoyed going to it. Gitlin does a great job of establishing a sense of community among the members of his class. The one downside of the class is that at times it felt like there was a ton of busy work",
    "As a non-history major who was looking for a fun history class, this was definitely a good bet. I learned things about Canada, Quebec, and all of the North America which I never would have known otherwise, and the class was engaging. Professor Gitlin is certainly very enthusiastic about the topic, as is Dean B. That being said, perhaps because I'm not as used to the history style, the seminar did feel a bit lecture-y at times and I wished we had more opportunities to have freer discussion as a class. Definitely a fun course to take though!",
    "I would not really recommend this course to another student, unless they were heavily invested in the course material beforehand. The material is interesting and Professor Gitlin is generally very nice and engaging, but the heavy-handed approach he takes to leading the seminar allows for little student input. As a result of this, I felt like I didn't get to know my classmates at all, as I have done quite well in other history seminars, and that I was not terribly engaged with the readings on a week-to-week basis.",
    "Yes. If you are a good note-taker and interested in the subject matter or are a Gitlin fan (I certainly am after taking the course!), you'll love the class.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Interesting material and great prof.",
    "Professor Gitlin is a Yale gem. He seems to know all there is to know about Canadian history, French North American history, and Yale history. It was truly a treat to learn from such a great historian, especially to learn about such an exciting, understudied subject.",
    "YES!",
    "I love Canada and Gitlin!! Professor Gitlin shows such a clear interest in his students, and I'm so glad that I took it for him, the poutine, the Canadian games, and the family learning!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in history. It is a treasure of a course-- entirely relevant, paradigm-shifting, stimulating and spellbinding. Each week, new and challenging questions were asked that forced students to think about history, memory, politics, and sociology in altogether different ways. Almost like brain candy.... The history of Quebec and Canada is incredibly rich-- i just cannot stress that enough. We are lucky to have a history course on Canadian history, as they are few and far between on college campuses in America. After taking this course, I can confidently conclude that my study of Canadian and Qubeois history will continue for a long time."
