    "This course focused on analyzing what economic inequality looks like from many different fronts. It addresses causes of inequality on the social, socio-economic, cultural level. It hints on poverty and poverty alleviation. It also delves into methods to combat inequality and much more. The course really pushes one to think beyond the standard intuition of good and bad, right and wrong, effective and ineffective, etc.",
    "Global economic inequality's historical evolution, metrics, theories, causes and effects, possible solutions especially fiscal and taxation policy and its efficacy.",
    "I learned about different measures of inequality, the origins of inequality in the modern world, the broad effects of inequality on society, and the ways in which we can combat inequality."

    "This is a discussion based class that really allows people to share their opinions and thoughts while listening to others. You learn a lot from the texts read and are able to apply your own knowledge to the topics for discussion purposes. It can be really interesting depending on the topic and how people participate.",
    "Strengths: small class size, expert professor, interesting readings, independent assignments that allow you to explore topics of specific interest to you Weaknesses: could learn more about methodologies",
    "Spend less time on The Spirit Level. More feedback from professor."
