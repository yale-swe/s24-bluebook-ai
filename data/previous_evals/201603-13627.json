   "comments": [
    "It really helped me think about building stories from other social norms and the ethics of doing that work. In terms of skills, I feel more capable of exploring themes within literature in a way that I had not learned from previous Yale classes.",
    "Reading skills Critical reading Analytical reading Using background, context, and theory to better understand texts Writing and research skills",
    "Learnt how to use sociological texts for analysis of literature and art works.",
    "This class was AMAZING! I learned so much about the intricacies of modern African fiction all while learning about pillars of sociology. All the best parts of a lit course, in addition to being a great introduction and examination of the sociology involved in narratives. Really incredible incredible course. My favorite I've taken yet at Yale.",
    "Taking this course, helped me to strengthen my writing skills and ability to analyze literary texts. Prior to taking this course, I had gotten a lot of practice in writing about novels and analyzing authorial choices. However, this class provided me with sociological theories and analyses to use alongside the literature, that helped me to understand the material in a way that I had never thought of before.",
    "I learned a lot about the intersection of sociology with other important fields of study--such as literature, economics, feminist theory, queer theory, religion etc... I also am able to have a more nuanced perspective regarding pieces of work that are labeled \"post colonial literature\"",
    "This course exposed me to literature I hadn't previously had the chance to explore as an English major, which I greatly appreciated.",
    "Best course ever.",
    "I developed the ability to listen to other people's stories and points of view in this class. I also developed a better understanding of sociology as a field and the methods used to arrive at knowledge in this area. I discovered y personal biases i bring into assessing work and developed a little more self awareness in the ways in which I looked at pieces of writing or art. I developed a better appreciation for narration and narratives in general, how they are spun and what they are composed of."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - very good selection of novels! Weaknesses\/improvement - more context for theory-heavy sociological readings would have helped apply larger themes to the novels studied.",
    "A little more lecturing on the sociology topics would have been useful.",
    "In general, I did not see any weaknesses in this course. The syllabus was thoroughly constructed and presented a wide array of narratives and perspectives. The discussions were always fruitful and everyone in the seminar seemed to be engaged at all times.",
    "I thought the course did a really great job of exposing us to a wide scope of African literature and dispelling the fallacy of a single postcolonial story or a single 'African' story. In a short span of time, we were able to address religion, sexuality, feminist theory, science fiction, urban spaces and many more subtopics that added to the multi-dimensionality of the course. Sometimes I thought that the volume of the readings meant to supplement each week's novel was too high--and because it was sometimes impossible to get through everything, it was difficult to get a cohesive class discussion going.",
    "The strength of this course lay in its material, the books chosen were well balanced and highly engaging. I would have liked some more diversity in classroom discussion\/activity as much of our learning came from the ability to sit between different academic worlds or ways of thinking.",
    "Best course ever.",
    "The course is a very effective one and taught in a very engaging manner. Most of the discussions were driven by the students and the students taking ownership of this class was one of the strengths of the course. The instructors were also amazing!",
    "One strength of this course were Professor Newell and Lim's engagement with students. They both did an incredible job of preparing before class to have engaging in class discussions. I think the course as whole does provide a solid introduction to thinking about African literature through a sociological perspective. The different books lent themselves to a range of different discussions that showcased the variety of ways to begin thinking about and questioning African literature. I think the only weakness of the course might have to do with a student's previous exposure to sociology. I had never taken a sociology course before this one, and I feel as if it would've been useful to perhaps have had a clearer understanding of different sociological frameworks, as I think it would've added to the way I read each text. I don't see this as a weakness of the course per say, but more as something to keep in mind when selecting students."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! It is pretty accessible for people from any academic background.",
    "Definitely take this course if you get the chance. The intersection between the disciplines is understudied, and it was really helpful especially as someone with little sociology background",
    "Yes. I found the material so great and every class discussion was so well structured. I often found myself wishing that we had more time to discuss some of the novels.",
    "Yes, definitely! It's interesting to be able to analyze literary texts using non-literary theory (i.e. sociology). The selection of topics was great and allowed for some very in-depth case studies for particular countries, while also some broader texts allowed for greater interpretation.",
    "YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES!!!!!!! Opened my eyes to a whole new world of literature and sociology. Really amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class would be a great fit for anyone who enjoys reading literary works, finding symbolism, engaging with secondary sources, and discussing the intersectionality of social identifiers within different societies.",
    "Yes I would--I think it really teaches you how to look at postcolonial literature and 'world' literature more complexly and allows you to read and contextualize a diverse range of narratives by African authors",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in literature and art and exploring narratives.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this courseDenise and Steph were wonderful, and I hope the course is offered again in the future!",
    "Yes!!!!!!!! Please take this course. Best course ever. So much engagement. Every class inspiring and makes you think. You will make a project you are proud of at the end of this course.",
    "Yes because it's amazing. You read incredible books and learn so much not just about the world but more about yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. First of all, Professor Newell and Lim were incredible professors to have in the same space. They engaged with and built off of each other in ways that always made class discussions even better. They're also incredibly kind and devoted to their students, and you will not find two better people to spend a semester with. The texts were in general very good, and I think most people will find something different to take away from each reading. The final project might seem daunting, but the fact that you are allowed to do a multimedia, creative project that you can take in literally any and all directions should be an incentive for any student to take this course. Professor Lim did an amazing job of combining art and film in this course, so students who are interested in the intersection of art and literature will definitely have opportunities to engage with both materials. There is essentially a book to read every single week, but the readings are, as I mentioned before, interesting and worth the time they take to read (some longer than others). Overall a great class with great professors--please take this course if it's ever offered again!"
