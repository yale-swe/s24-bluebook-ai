    "This class taught me fundamentals of graphic design that I will surely use in the future. It also taught me how to work by hand with accuracy.",
    "I learned a lot about what makes for a visually compelling composition. I learned some technical skills as well, though the majority of the class was less focused on software and more focused on cultivating a visual eye.",
    "You learn how to think in terms of the building blocks and tenets of design and its process: type, composition, revision, addition and subtraction.",
    "This course placed an emphasis on the more conceptual aspects of design rather than the technical aspects of design, which I think was a positive thing for an introductory design course it got us thinking about the big picture of our projects and the entire piece as a composition rather than just small elements. While I definitely wish it was able to also give us a more comprehensive design vocabulary, it gave me a much more attuned eye, which is ultimately the most valuable thing for an introduction to design.",
    "I learned about some of the fundamentals of design and how to be more conscientious about making meaningful choices in design.",
    "I learned to how to master the xacto knife and make clean and precise compositions",
    "Developed understanding of type and spatial relationships on the page, primarily through analog means of working."

   "comments": [
    "Julian isn't afraid to give you an honest critique of your work, so I felt like everyone was very eager to work hard and gain his seal of approval. I don't think there were many weaknesses, though I do wish I had more chances to practice Photoshop\/InDesign. The workload was heavy, especially at the beginning, but it was a class worth taking.",
    "I learned a lot of more conceptual\/perceptive skills in this class rather than concrete knowledge, which in some ways a strength and in some ways a weakness. The biggest strength is probably the projects and assignments, I felt that each built off the other or focused on different important areas of design, allowing you to look back on the progression of your work. Critiques were sometimes drawn out and inefficient, but overall I feel like I got a lot out of them. I did, however, struggle to conclude the main criticisms of my work and didn't really find I had an understanding of what I should be focusing on in the future.",
    "The course had great assignments that forced you to work with you hands, and interesting lectures and readings. Towards the end of the semester, it did get a little tedious to have critiques every single class. I wish we could have had more lectures or lessons,",
    "crits are way too long. people end up not listening to one another's.",
    "I would have liked to spend more time on inDesign and Photoshop as only one lesson was spent on learning digital methods. Given our reliance today on these programs, I would think it would be important to focus more on this."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah, great course.",
    "Yes! Make sure to make room for the workload in your schedule, but also be prepared to grow a lot as a designer.",
    "Absolutely. It'll change the way you engage with design, if you're not into it already, and open up a series of classes that will facilitate an extremely useful technical skill and artistic practice.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to another student Julian is great and the projects were really interesting and both fun and challenging. A lot of what I gained from the course was eye training over technical skill after analyzing so much work and investigating what worked and what didn't, I felt I had a much better perceptual understanding of design and could be a lot more discerning. I definitely wished for some more instruction in technical skill and vocabulary, but overall it was a great introduction to design, a really rewarding class. The workload is large but manageable, no worse than most other classes.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student so they can change how they look at the world and be able to analyze design proficiently.",
    "I'd recommend this course because Julian is a good lecturer.",
    "At times exercises\/classes might feel somewhat trivial\/mundane but overall I did feel like I learned a lot about graphic design and would recommend this class."
