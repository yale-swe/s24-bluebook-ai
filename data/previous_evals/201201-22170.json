   "comments": [
    "This course covers militarism in Germany from 1618 to the present. I would recommend this course only because of the interesting nature of the material covered. Some minor changes to the course, such as aligning the reading with the lectures, would be needed before I would give this class a true endorsement.",
    "War in Germany is an interesting class, but not the most satisfying in the history department. While this course does allow students to gain a nice overview of German history, the narrative is often determined by Professor Tooze's strong worldview, which can dominate the lectures (and is slightly unorthodox). He is a very interesting instructor, though, and you just need to be prepared for some views that are not always similar the traditional views. Most of the readings are journalistic articles rather than primary sources or historical texts, which is also different from other history courses. Battle tactics are discussed more in this course than in any other I have taken, so if that interests you, this is a good course to take. The lectures aren't extremely well-organized, but they aren't boring either. Professor Tooze usually reads them from a paper, but once you get used to that they are pretty good. It's not the best course in the department, but it's solid, so I recommend it to people who are highly interested in the topics.",
    "History 231 is a really solid course for any history major looking for a well informed and nuanced approach to central and general european history that questions traditional assumptions at the core of german history. As tooze does not seem to assume any pre-existing knowledge of the subject matter, non-majors can jump in without feeling behind.the readings were totally manageable and provided a several viewpoints each week which tooze both acknowledges and questions. the class is just as much about understanding the historiography as it is learning the history. the section is a great forum for discussion and tooze, by posing questions about the week's core ideas, provides for interesting and impassioned discussion.take it, take any and every class with tooze. he's the type of professor who reminds you why you came to yale.",
    "Take this class! I learned so much and looked forward to doing the readings. Professor Tooze is amazing. The military history part is really interesting, even if you're not especially into military history. There's more about military theory than about specific weapons.",
    "Yes-- great material and depth with an amazing lecturer.",
    "Very interesting content, especially as courses on military history are a little sparse; shop it, especially for the content; hopefully it will be better organized in future renditions, since this was the first time it was taught; reading responses were a little difficult since readings were sometimes not determine until two days before the responses were due; this might be a better choice if a paper replaces those responses; midterm and final were fine",
    "I would absolutely recommend History 231 for a fellow student, especially if he or she has had any interest in military history.",
    "This class is an excellent survey view of European history from the Thirty Years' War to the present day, viewed through the lens of Germany's European history. It truly was a fantastic class, hands-down the best I've taken at Yale. I strongly recommend it if you have any interest in European history or in the history of German militarism. Professor Tooze is amazing and if you pay attention, the class will not let you down. Strongly, strongly recommend."
