   "comments": [
    "I really liked this course and found most of the work outside lecture very helpful in bringing home concepts. The first problem set was terrific and clearly related to the lecture\/take-aways. The second problem set was irritating (the computer platform was difficult to use) and much less clearly applicable.Also, I would have appreciated more application to current, real-world problems. Perhaps and additional few lectures, rather than just one or two rushed ones at the very end.",
    "I found the meta analysis to be useful and enlightening",
    "I entered this class with great expectations--I'd heard much about the caliber of the course, the great teaching, and good content. I was disappointed, mostly because I didn't find the content all that interesting. It was also fairly challenging, but it was sometimes difficult to see how the material I was learning would be applicable in the real world to anyone outside of scientists developing models and research projects. I struggled to see how I could use much of the content in an applied policy context. And much of the content for the first half of the course was so models driven that if I didn't catch the model early on, I would be lost for the remainder of the lecture.",
    "the course is based on primary literature and this is not always the best way to learn new material. Although the content described in lecture was clear, after the fact there are limited resources to go to for clear explanations of the theory.",
    "Dave Skelly is a great lecturer. I found the readings difficult, but they were mostly short. Whatever difficulties I had in the class were I think due to my own lack of background in the subject. The class format should not change because of that, however, since the whole point is (I think) to jump in the deep end.",
    "Although this is meant to be an introduction, I felt the speed of the class tried to cover too much. It had a feel of Ecology 101 - a lot of material, but not as applicable as I would have liked. I would recommend more interactive assignements - like the Sortie assignement. Memorizing equasions and definitions is not as important as understanding how to use them.",
    "1&2: several of the readings for class were very technical, and I don't think he did a good job explaining them in lecture, especially for people who have no ecology\/natural science background. This is in fact a foundations class, not advanced.4: the workload for this class was a lot heavier than other courses at FES. The readings combined with an intensive paper (that, after 2 meetings with the professor and 2 meetings with the TAs, I still felt like I had little guidance on), problem sets, midterm, and final, altogether were too much. Maybe cutting out just one of the problem sets or the midterm (or replacing it with another problem set) would be better.8: one of the main things I disliked about the class was that it was so focused on memorizing studies and models and the people behind them. It focused too much on the formulas and details of the models\/experiments, rather than taking a big-picture look at them. I agree these models are necessary to review, but I would have preferred to focus on the basic dynamics and parameters and main results than so much of the detail.3. I just have to say, I loved the second problem set and getting to play around with the individual-based model. It really helped me understand how it works.",
    "I took the course because it was a foundations course. I learned valuable insights into the scientific process, but I was hoping for a broader understanding of general concepts of ecology from the class. I understand the value of reading primary sources, but I think it would have been helpful to insert more textbook-like readings.",
    "The professor teaches at a level that is unreachable for those of us with no background in ecology, and doesn't seem to care that this is the case.",
    "Question 8: The course felt like it had 5-6 meetings more than it needed. Everything before the midterm felt vital, but several lectures towards the end of the semester felt tacked on and unrelated (and, in fact, were not included in the problem sets or final exam).",
    "I wish at the beginning of the course, Prof. Skelly had been more explicit about the content of the course and its focus on modeling...",
    "6. As a foundational course, this class had a wide range of competency. Having never taken ecology before, I would have preferred the class was taught more to people like myself and less to people that had taken 3+ courses in the field.",
    "Readings were too advanced for me. I ended up not doing them. Content was great and Skelly is a good lecturer. SLides could have had more of the info on them for the purposes of study.",
    "I know that there were some students concerned about keeping up with the pace of this class, but as I understand it, the motivation behind making this a foundations class was to raise the bar of expectations in the curriculum, and I think it did just that. There was a lot of information covered, but all the resources (readings, meeting with TAs\/Prof. Skelly, review sessions) were all there.",
    "Readings were too scientific in many instances. Hence, gave up reading them after a point. Not aiming to become an ecologist.If a person does not have an basic ecology background - the first 5-7 classes can seem pretty intimidating. Putting in additional effort through student study groups is what helped me.",
    "3- I found the problem sets in general to be very helpful for better understanding the material. The paper did give me an opportunity to explore a topic of interest, but was less directly helpful in learning the class material.4- I found the paper to be a HUGE amount of effort - much more than the average paper, and apart from teaching that these types of analyses are very time intensive, wasn't sure that was worth it.7 - There were sometimes disconnects between TA and professor grading - would encourage ensuring good communication on expectations.",
    "Question 1: the readings were often overly complex and not directly related to the lectures, except in passing, which made them a burdensome distraction rather than helpful to understanding the material. Original literature is great for developing research and manuscript questions, but is unwieldy to introduce students to basic concepts. There should be a landscape ecology textbook (if one exists) and other more fundamental readings that can be recommended to guide the course material, because a digestible written explanation of the class's topics, which Powerpoint-style bulletpoints simply cannot convey, could promote discussion and greater engagement by the students during the lectures.",
    "I felt there was little concrete information I took away from the course. This is probably related to the field, but I had other expectations at the start of the course.",
    "I wish that Skelly had focused a bit more on the current urban reality of landscapes. It would have been helpful if problem sets were more regular, as I found that they (particularly the first of two) were instrumental in solidifying some of the concepts covered in class.",
    "Question 10 - I enjoyed the class and am glad I took it, but my interests are in the urban environment\/sustainable development\/economics so I do not find the class essential to students with my interests.",
    "Question 4A great deal of material was covered in this course and it would have been beneficial to have had more problem sets worth a lower overall percentage of our final grade to reinforce key concepts and applications of topics covered.",
    "Professor Skelly is a great lecturer. The out of class work didn't always seem very useful. As a foundations class, meant to provide an introduction to ecology, I think the pace of the course was a little fast. It would have been useful to have a class or two at the beginning or the course that covered basic ecology principles, or have the TAs run an intro session to help those who hadn't taken any ecology before. The meta-analysis project was a huge amount of work.",
    "Question 10 - Landscape ecology was a very good class, but an introductory ecology \/ general ecology course would be useful for non-science major backgrounds",
    "Question 3: The meta-analysis was good for encouraging students to become familiar with a small corner of the literature, but I feel it did very little to increase our understanding of landscape ecology. This sort of assignment belongs in a class on analytical or statistical methods, not as the major assignment for landscape ecology. It simply wasn't that useful given the amount of time it required.",
    "The instructor was good, but the class was very large, so sometimes a little more energy would have been helpful in rallying the class.Main complaint - as this is an evolving field, there is no textbook. Many terms that came up in lecture were explained in the slides, but a good handful were not - and even internet research was not useful in finding a good answer. Clearly, I could have asked in office hours, but such questions often arise the night before an assignment is due (no matter how long before the deadline the assignment is begun), and asking the TA\/professor isn't feasible.",
    "Heavy readings, final paper is very demanding",
    "Question 10:Although in the end the material was very well understood I think the final outome of the class could be way more valuable if at the beginning of the course a couple of sessions were devoted to a general review or introducction to ecological concepts and theories. Starting with so specific topics in Landscape Ecology can be confusing and frustrating specially to those who are not trained in ecology.",
    "although we didn't have lab work, the meta analysis assignment was helpful for me. it familiarized me with journals and search engines. However I believe that we could have benefited from more advice on choosing the topic."

    "The instructor.",
    "The professor knows his material, very, very well.The presentations are well-organized and timed perfectly.The meta-analysis paper is a good exercise and may prove directly useful for people's capstone\/thesis project.Very appreciative that there is no textbook to purchase!",
    "I think the introduction to the models in a chronological way was very good",
    "He's a very thorough and prepared lecturer--it's clear he puts a lot of thought into selecting appropriate readings and in preparing lectures.",
    "The instructor was quite engaging and presented the material not only in a compelling way, but also placed it in a broader context of significance. Also, the paper gave me the opportunity to learn a great deal about conducting a meta-analysis.",
    "the course provides a framework for understanding the legacy of the theory of landscape ecology - where it came from and where it is going.",
    "Lectures",
    "I appreciated the course theme of analyzing different ecological models and how they had progressed over 40 years.",
    "It was a refresher and an update of the theories of Landscape Ecology, and at the same time the instructor recognizes that developments in this field are making the course outdated for this level of studies.",
    "Prof. Skelly does a great job building a narrative of the development of landscape ecology. He offers good explanations and examples of application.",
    "I really enjoyed having Dr. Skelly as the main lecturer because he is an amazing lecturer (very clear and concise) and extremely knowledgable. In addition, his passion for his work is very obvious when he lecturers and it makes the class more enjoyable. I really enjoyed the subject matter. The things we learned about are very important in my own academic education and future.",
    "Dave is fantastic. The 80% of classes (and readings) that were on topic were excellent, easy to understand, and just the right amount of work.",
    "The applicability of the subject to my research interests.",
    "The paper. I learned a lot from doing the paper.",
    "Instructor and tas were open and helpful, problem sets were highly beneficial, and the paper allowed much space for personal exploration.",
    "The course was extremely well structured and progressed chronologically and in theme. This careful framework enhanced the ability to understand the theories presented and also illustrates how theory can be translated into practice.",
    "Great background of terms and concepts important for ecology.",
    "I learned a lot and I like the professor's lecture! Very orgnized and clear and useful!",
    "This was by far my favorite class this semester. Skelly is an incredibly thoughtful, clear, and intelligent teacher. I really appreciated how, when he would present especially difficult material, he would pause and make a space in which asking questions was possible.He made it clear for us how all the topics in the class fit together. And the topics are so cool because they link particular experiments and models with big ideas - some of the biggest and most basic out there!The meta-analysis assignment was very difficult but a great learning experience. The exams were challenging, but fair and even fun :)",
    "Dave is a talented lecturer, very enjoyable.",
    "The problem sets were very useful and challenging.",
    "The last few classes on climate envelope, corridors, amphibians and climate change, and conservation biology introduction.",

    "The focus on systems and thinking about big picture connections in a critical way.",
    "Understanding and learning about some of the foundational papers and concepts in ecology.",
    "Course was very organized and Skelly was efficient, covering the material according to the original syllabus almost 100% to the letter. It provided more than just a landscape ecology overview by going over general ecological theory and biogeography as well.",
    "Great lectures. The problem sets were always very helpful.",
    "It got me thinking about things I would have never thought about and that do matter.",
    "Skelly has an interesting perspective which makes you think",
    "nice arc through the history of theoretical and applied work in the field.",
    "The professor's clear lecture style.The dean's lectures were very interesting.",
    "The information from this class really lets you look at the way conservation work is done critically. I like the way we look at current issues in conservation through a landscape ecology lens. The lectures were usually thorough and well planned.",
    "Concepts were very well explained",
    "The extensive use of ecological models as heuristics",
    "Landscape Ecology was an extremely well structured course, with a clear arc of learning objectives and connection between theory and practice. Professor Skelly did a generally great job with the lectures, and work was well-balanced throughout the term.",
    "Course was very clearly and logically designed. As much as I disliked this course, I have to admit that it was so well designed that I'm probably going to retain the material more so than in my other courses.",
    "- This course bring to life critical issues in ecology, conservation biology and management.- The evolving nature of this course makes it a great option for researchers in ecology and conservation biology.- The Professor was very honest about the nature of the course. He always led the students to follow up with other relevant materials from other related disciplines and authors.",
    "Prof. Skelly as very thoughtful about showing the evolution of thought and leaving the student to develop their own conclusions about where conservation and large scale studies of ecology should be focusing.",
    "Great lectures, and well selected readings",
    "Great lectures; great slides; very interesting course material.",
    "Engaging lecture style (when the lectures were interesting), the prof was responsive to student questions and made the atmosphere one in which such questions were encouraged.",
    "Interesting field, I believe I have gained fluency in the relevant theories and concepts.",
    "The exposure to so many papers that shaped the field of Landscape Ecology",
    "The teacher's method of teaching and the lack of weekly assignments, but rather simply 2 problems sets, two exams, and one project.",
    "To me, the chance that it gave me to develop a whole new approach for analyzing and understanding biologial and social patterns and processes with a conceptual and mathematical yet simple perspective of life and time - space interactions.",
    "That Skelly started with old theories and took us through the evolution of the body of knowledge that makes up landacape ecology. This made me feel in the feet of the scholars that developed the theories."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "I would have preferred a smaller class or a more engaging atmosphere. The class size was so large it was difficult to ask questions.",
    "Trying to be too many things for too many people. For ecologists it is too simplistic, for people without this background it is too complicated. I don't think there is an easy way to fix this though I think the professor did as good as job as possible to balance the course.Post lecture notes the day before class so we can print them out and take notes on them in class.First few lectures seemed to be more of a justification for why landscape ecology is relevant, rather than just teaching the subject. I think this explanation is necessary for the first class session, but after that it doesn't need to be addressed again.The readings are a good exercise in understanding primary literature. However, I found that they were not necessary for understanding the lectures and therefore stopped reading many of them in depth. It seems if the readings are more of an exercise in how to read scientific papers (which can be justified, certainly), rather than understand the course material.I think slides that show the derivation of equations could be removed. For applied ecologists this is important to know, but for me it was time that could have been used to explain their application in more detail or on another topic.",
    "Being able to accomidate students who are completely new to the subject and students who have been studying ecology for several years. I do not know how to do that.",
    "I would suggest that people complete a statistics course BEFORE entering this course--I think I would have gotten much more out of both the readings as well as the meta-analysis if I'd had any background, whatsoever, which I didn't.",
    "The topic selection process for the final paper could be improved. One the one hand, it was broad which allowed students to pursue their individual interests. But on the other hand it was specific in the methodology that it asked for. I get the sense that a lot of students didn't feel comfortable pursuing their individual interests because they were concerned with meeting the methodological criteria.",
    "On the other hand (of question 12), practical applications of landscape ecology were not as thoroughly explained or developed. So, although I have a clear understanding of the theory I don't have as good of an idea of what can be done with the science.",
    "The meta-analysis assignment had me stumped. It may have been my own need of more background in this type of writing and research, but I found it to be very difficult both conceptually and operationally. It was still a great experience for learning, just not something I felt like I did a very good job on.",
    "Making it more fun to learn instead of just hard boring work.",
    "The course was heavy on the early days of landscape ecology. It would have been nicer to focus more on the contemporary and applications.",
    "The pace and the amount of work.",
    "The fact that this course is a requirement for all MEM students means that the material should be accessible to all students, not just those with a background in ecology. I don't feel like it was adjusted at all from its former state to accommodate the changing nature of the course.",
    "The organization of the less critical lectures and readings needs to be brought to a similar level as the rest of the course.",
    "The course is excellent as a more advanced rather than foundational course. It offers insight to spcae as a variable, and to important concpets in recent ecological theories and modelling; but is narrowly focused in practice of ecology on biotic conservation.Furthermore, while it is important to incorporate mathematicla calculations related to each model, going over the full equations in class is redundant and at times confusing.",
    "Some of the Island Biogeography\/Metapopulation lectures were a bit heavy on the mathematical derivations of the models. I am not sure this was central to grasping the concepts and understanding how and why they were developed.",
    "The meta-analysis is an unreasonable assignment. I spent more time trying to find a topic in my field that hadn't been done before than I spent on the paper itself. While a meta-analysis may be a reasonable masters thesis, for a semester-long course we should be able to explore a topic of interest without being so restricted by innovation.",
    "I think an intermediate assignment in the meta-analysis would have been useful for me - something due in between the proposal and the final paper - like maybe having to turn in our data analysis and an outline of what problems we are currently having with it. I would have liked to have a little nudge to get to that point in the assignment a little earlier than I did.",
    "I think next time Prof. Skelly should encourage all students to do meta analyses...",
    "Slides. Readings.",
    "I didn't feel like the paleoecology lectures seemed to fit in all that well, but it could have been the timing of them.",
    "Assign a basic ecology textbook. Or chapters that might be relevant for classes.Do not understand why the video-taped lectures were not made available to students. Many of us would have found that useful initially.",
    "I like that there was no textbook, but I think there should have been more general readings and possibly review papers to augment the other papers. It was far too difficult to see subject-matter coherence in the beginning. Having a review paper at the outset would help to contextualize the admittedly amorphous field of landscape ecology.",
    "The second half of the course feels like a random scattering of ideas and papers. I don't think that it really covered some of the basic concepts. I understand the professor highlighting work they know, but there was an overemphasis of work coming out of University of Washington (good school, but no school deserves that kind of focus).",
    "Felt like three different, disconnected courses occurring at the same time: the lectures (important for the exams), the readings (which sometimes were important for the assignments), and all the work people have to do for the manuscript. So tying readings more closely to the lectures would be a first excellent step. Also, problem sets could be spaced out more during the semester to encourage constant engagement and thoughtfulness with the material. A couple of questions every two weeks, for example, would actually get people to participate and not panic trying to cover all the complex issues at once.I feel the class has another weakness. For those who have never taken biology or ecology, it is too complex and specialized because it has no treatment of the concepts of genetics, physiology, taxonomy, or evolution, for example. Not understanding those concepts, but still trying to appreciate why modelling landscapes and organisms is important really turns everything into cartoons upon which students can project whatever disciplinary biases they already have. In that sense, students will lose an appreciation of biology and the truths of nature itself. Mentioning things like niches, specialists-generalists, fitness, etc doesn't seem useful to people who never learned those terms in the first place.Another good percentage of the class does have biology and ecology experience (and I count myself among them). For us, this class is also not helpful because it is too large and not easily amenable to discussion and engagement. It becomes an undergrad-style lecture class that does not offer nearly that much new information and cannot incorporate the ideas and participation of students with background. It would be much better to have a small, discussion-oriented ecology class available for people with biology experience instead of funneling all MEMs into this class (okay, maybe I should've applied for an exemption).",
    "Cater to a larger audience.",
    "It would be nice to receive the problem sets prior to the test. Since it is really the only feedback, besides tests, it is hard to know if we are learning the material.",
    "More hands-on coursework would be nice, concerning concrete applications about what was seen in class instead of the one huge meta-analysis.",
    "Professor is extremely unclear when explaining things in class. Needs to learn to communicate more succinctly. He gets so caught up in all the details of an article, theory, etc and then side tracked that one forgets what the initial point is. As a result, I often didn't understand what the main point of many things were, or basic definitions. I think the power points were too complex and its necessary to simplify them. The course covered so many different authors\/papers it was hard to know which ones to study\/focus on. A study guide of concepts to know\/remember would have been useful. Professor sometimes uses terminology but doesn't define what he is talking about.The powerpoints are very snazzy, but to be honest they are difficult to study with. The main points often aren't covered on them. Professor needs to understand that students taking the class with diverse range of interests and thus he should communicate accordingly.",
    "need problem sets\/assignments to help students apply their learning. a weekly discussion section would have been helpful as well.",
    "I found the material covered after the midterm not very interesting. The pace of the course seemed to slow after the midterm as well.",
    "Further structured guidance regarding our literature review\/meta-analysis process (such as a mandatory first draft) would have been very helpful.",
    "If this is going to continue to be a foundations course, there should be more introductory material available to help those students who haven't had ecology before. Also, I think the course material should be linked to the big picture more often. At times it became confusing how various topics covered really related to landscape ecology. The problem sets were helpful, but long. I think the first one would have been more manageable if students had been given one problem every week or so, as the topics were covered.",
    "difficult subject, but needs more interconnection between class themes.",
    "The use of ecological models as heuristics, while excellent, may also prove to be too advanced for students without a background in biology or ecology. Perhaps this could be taken into consideration?",
    "Although one of the aims of this course was to introduce us to the primary literature, more direct connections between lecture and reading would be helpful.",
    "One can say that the issue of scale applies to this class as well - a popular class applied at a small scale turned out not to be the best fit for a larger scale that included a large audience of students with little formal scientific training. If this course continues to be offered as a foundations class, it needs to be tailored for a non-specialist audience. One suggestion is to use more examples applying the material to real-life management dilemmas and decisions - my favorite lectures were about modeling survival outcomes for spotted owls based on different management plans, and about global biodiversity. The latter half of the course was much more interesting and useful than the first - how much history and theory do we *really* need to know?",
    "There level of detail and equations sometimes felt out of scale with the themes and questions being addressed. So much information was covered that it was challenging to have a rich understanding of all of it.",
    "The course was too large.",
    "This class is simply not an introductory class. It assumes either adequate prior knowledge of ecology or a magical ability to become suddenly proficient in the field. Every single piece of reading is primary literature. The TAs provide no structured support outside of office hours. Assignments were too few and far between to aid in the understanding of the material. Too much time is spent focusing on outdated approaches to landscape ecology, in the name of constructing a strong disciplinary foundation, instead of challenging students to grapple with current challenges of natural resource management. Most importantly, perhaps, the class does not adequately grapple with the difficult questions of what exactly constitutes landscape ecology and how we as professional non-scientists might make use of the knowledge learned in this class. After a significant amount of work, I have no firmer grasp on how to apply principles of landscape ecology to my professional work.",
    "While acknowledging the instructor's challenge in teaching a class that is relevant for students with a wide range of experience in ecology, the challenges posed by this situation made the class a lesser experience than it could have been. In my case, I had quite a bit of ecology background, and a professional interest in large scale conservation. The course touched on many issues of relevance, but often stopped short when things were just starting to get interesting, and often leaving out the additional level that would make a difference for individuals like myself.In courses similar to this in undergrad, a very effective compromise was a 3 credit course with a large lecture style class, with an additional 1 credit discussion group - this would have provided an opportunity for students like me to delve deeper into the subject matter.",
    "Most students ended up doing a lit review for the major writing assignment (and not a meta-analysis) because there wasn't enough comparable data. For one, more guidance would have been useful (earlier and more deadlines for topic selection - say a handful of topics with literature, then a one-page write-up, then a full bibliography) as many students realized late in the game that they didn't have enough studies for a meta-analysis. On the other hand, there was next to no clear guidance on what the literature review should look like - clearly, the professor preferred the meta-analysis, but still, more information on format and expectations should have been made available for the lit review.",
    "The final paper: we need more guidance from the Professor",
    "Too many topics for a semester not because of the work load but cause of there are many topics that are worth to go more in depth. Maybe the TA should be able to discuss with students the class topics more broadly every week. And please try to find a TextBook!",
    "the way that the exams and problem sets are graded. it is very sketchy.",
    "I understand it is now a foundation course but still the class size is too big."

    "I found the TA more accessable than the instructor.",
    "Great",
    "The professor was extremely helpful, but the TAs were not helpful in the least. I think there needs to be more communication between them and the professor, for them to be able to help answer our questions on assignments and papers.",
    "I have contacted Dr. Skelly and Jennifer Miller for help. Dr. Skelly was great help in whatever issue that I had. Jennie is a great TA but sometimes I felt she lacked knowledge of the subject matter.",

    "I never sought help from the TAs on the course material, but when I had other questions (i.e. on the exam or paper) I would email Jennie and she was very responsive.",
    "I don't think they were prepared to really help us much. I went to three TA sessions and they were nice and encouraging, but a waste of time.",
    "excellent",
    "The Instructor and TAs were very responsive to questions, providing insightful and clear answers.",
    "I saw the instructor and one TA once each, and in both instances they were helpful. I will comment that in a big lecture course, I feel less inclined to seek help during office hours because I feel more alienated from the instructor and TA, and find it difficult to establish or build a rapport.",
    "Instructor - highly accessible and available.",
    "The TA was very available.",
    "Both were very available and helpful.",
    "It truly saddens me to say that the instructor and the TAs were not helpful. It seemed to many students that some kind of institutional politics were having a negative impact on the syllabus and pedagogy. In spite of multiple attempts to secure some help for the large numbers of students struggling with the class, no additional resources were provided. The professor seems to have a puzzling sink or swim mentality and one could argue that this approach does not create better environmental managers which is, in the end, the ostensible goal of the school.",
    "The professor was very responsive to student questions during class, but I never had much reason to attend office hours.",
    "In general, when questions were asked, they were helpful.",
    "Great help",
    "Often the TAs didn't agree on particular topics. this was confusing!",
    "I contact Prof. Skelly and he was very responsive and accessible."

   "comments": [
    "I have never taken a dedicated ecology course, although I was familiar with the most basic of ecological concepts from some of my undergraduate courses (predator\/prey interactions, growth rates\/life strategies, etc.).I do not think that the subject is easily transferable to areas outside of ecology (e.g. like economics or environmental policy do). It provides information that is good to know when working in any area of environmental conservation, but if you are not interested in the material directly it is hard to justify the time put into this course.I feel that this course gave me some interesting background information and vocabulary, but I feel that my time would have been better spent gaining more in depth knowledge in my area of interest. In my opinion it should not be a required foundation.",
    "I think that anyone that is going to be engaging in plant, animal, or land conservation should understand this material to some degree.",
    "I am not sure that this course necessarily needs to be one of the Foundation courses. I learned a lot, but I don't really understand the reasoning for this course as opposed to others.",
    "I think that this course should be offered, but I don't think it should be offered as a fundamental course - given the level of understanding that seems to be needed as pre-requisite.",
    "Yes, very much. I can't imagine a degree program at FES in which it would not fit. Good choice for a Foundations course",
    "I'm interested in conservation strategy so the study of large scale ecological patters of the sort introduced here is inherently relevant.",
    "This is my field and the lessons apply to the work that I will be doing in the future. Although I had Ecology in undergraduate studies, this course was more detailed.",
    "I come from a social science background, but wanted to take the class to broaden my understanding and get a good foundation in ecology and natural science. I think it's important to have the understanding because ultimately, I will need to know the basics of ecological processes even when I'm dealing with people, as they all live in some environment and deal with ecology at some level. I think this class gave me that good foundation, but it was a struggle for someone like me not coming from a ecology background. I feel this class was not a \"foundations\" class, and was a bit too advanced for me. That's not a negative on the class, just on how it is labeled; it's misleading.",
    "This course fits perfectly into my academic background and future. I found the material to be very helpful and useful.",
    "Because of this class, I will probably not take any more ecology classes, even though they would be useful.",
    "Very, very, very useful and important. I will be using these lessons in years to come, both in continuing my education and in my own work.",
    "It provided a sound understanding of the history of ecology and provided insight into how to answer ecological questions.",
    "This class taught me how to do thorough ecological research, which has already proved very useful in other classes, even though this class is not directly related to my focus.",
    "The course expanded my horizons in terms of modelling and spatial thinking. However, other system ecology courses might have contributed more to my ability to solve policy problems.",
    "My professional interests are landscape-scale land conservation. This course was extremely helpful in helping me understand the science behind this scale of thinking. It offers an understanding of the evolution of the science as well as an understanding of how and why the scientific work is approached in these manners.",
    "This course does not relate to my program. I am a student in another department who had an interest in the dynamics of Landscape. Although the instructor told me that this course would be appropriate and that no prerequisites were required, I found the case to be otherwise. The terms discussed in the course were never adequately explained. In other words, the course lectures assumed prior knowledge of ecology.",
    "Ecology background.",
    "I think this course will impact my perspective on everything else I take at FES.",
    "This was a great first class, it really got me thinking about the scale of ecology that I would like to study.",
    "inspirational to future academic goals",
    "Well, in retrospect this was a lost class for me because it was only about half new material. So yes I should have applied for an exemption and looked for a smaller, more advanced class. But I still saw it as an opportunity for a review of ecological concepts and getting back into the mindset of thinking up ecological research questions, which I had been involved in in the past. The course succeeded in convincing me that ecology is not for me, so I give it its due credit in that regard. That being said, I will not rule out other conservation-related courses in the future.",
    "No it doesnt. It seems to be a course that is good for scientists only.",
    "It was an MEM requirement, but I probably would have take Landscape Ecology anyways. I am interested in private land conservation and I have taken field ecology in the past, but this course was a lot of new and very useful information.",
    "It fit in less than I expected. I took it because it was a foundation and because I wanted a basis of ecology but I felt it didn't link enough to other disciplines.",
    "This course was a requirement. Otherwise I wouldn't have taken it. Because of my interest in urban development I thought it would be useful however that interest wasn't really touched upon much in the lectures.",
    "It doesn't really relate to my background. My academic background is in economics and art history, and my professional background is in finance.",
    "I've had ecology classes before, but never studied it at the large, landscape scale. This course helped me understand why certain conservation areas were designed the way they are.",
    "well - glad I took it because I will build on this class by taking an ecology course next semester. It is good because I am not a science major. So it was a helpful jumpstart.",
    "It has added depth to the natural sciences component of my MEM",
    "One of my goals at FES is to build a strong foundation in the biological and physical sciences. I'd already taken many ecology courses as an undergraduate, but was interested in taking this particular course thinking it would help to understand ecology at the 'macro-level' - after all, aren't budding conservationists supposed to be thinking at the landscape level?",
    "I am very interested in community economic development from social, environmental and economic perspectives. This course contributed to my knowledge of the environmental piece, giving me a better understanding of how humans impact the environment and how communities might be designed differently.",
    "As explained above, the class added some new elements to my understanding of ecology, but often covered some ideas which were fairly basic and felt like review. The professor makes a solid effort to include the practical implications of the field for conservation, but stops short of the kind of knowledge that I would feel to be especially useful in the course of working in conservation.A significant portion of the class relates to the analytical approaches that landscape ecologists use (e.g. meta-analyses, individual based models etc) which are interesting and gives insights into how ecologists think and work, but perhaps focus too much on how landscape ecology develops, rather than what it has to say about the nature of the natural world.",
    "Foundation for the field of conservation - important class. Many concepts were familiar from working in conservation but it was good to see where they came from. Still, the first half of the course should have been more applied - there were a lot of studies, a lot of papers, and only in a few cases did the applied value (even at the time of writing) become clear. This link was much more clear (I guess with the development of the field...) in the second half of the class.",
    "I'm not sure it does. For an MEM, this course goes way to deep in Ecology detail. It was a painful learning experiennce. But I'm happy I learned what I learned",
    "Though the course thankfully was great, especially due to the professor, i'm not sure if this is needed as a foundations course for the MEM curriculum. It doesn't relate much, at least not relatively so in comparison to other courses, to somebody whose background and professional direction is not in ecology.",
    "It was a great course for me because I learned that many questions about ecology are still unanswered. I believe this course is basic for anyone planning to work for the environment.",
    "My area of focus is 'social ecology' and for me it is important to understand the concepts of landscape conservation models the science behind it, its approach and implications. More so, understanding such practices\/concepts will enable us to integrate communities to such conservation models to strengthen better partnership and stewardship of landscapes for effective conservation."

    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "Yes!",
    "No. One of the fundamental problems with the course at this point is that it is supposed to be both a foundations course, but I was also told I should take it as someone with a real biology\/ecology background. My friends without ecology backgrounds were often lost, while I wanted more. While parts were interesting, I could just read the book Song of the Dodo and get big chunks of the material.",
    "Well no it didn't, for the reasons outlined above. I didn't feel the class met the needs of either novice or experienced biology\/ecology students. It's great to set high standards about the manuscript and strict deadlines, but the requirements of the class were just not appropriate for a large lecture class (which I think should use exams and problem sets). I've also never done very well in large classes, and this was no exception, so I won't blame the class for that. But a class that asks high standards of us should offer the kind of small classroom environment and integrated discussion that gives us the opportunity to participate and strong in-class support the entire time. Believe it or not, it can be really hard to find enough out-of-class office hours to get sufficient support and feedback on a manuscript and our ideas that we are considering from the class. So yes, I accept that it's my fault for being disengaged in this class, but I also think I would be a great student and do much better in a small class. I suppose I didn't expect to feel like an undergrad again when I came to Yale.",

    "For much of the course, I didn't really see how the things we were learning related to landscape scale ecology. While it came together at the end, in the last few lectures and in studying for the final, it was frustrating for much of the semester.",

I get the sense that this dissapoints both students with an ecology background, and poses a heavy challenge for students with very little ecology background.",
    "Yes - although I had heard multiple people refer to this class as \"the best class at FES\". While I did benefit from the class, I've certainly had much better classes here (probably has a lot to do with personal interest). So no - it didn't live up to my expectations, but especially the second half of the class was worthwhile.",

    "Leave plenty of time for studying and working on projects.",
    "Stay on top of the lectures, many concepts will repeat themselves, so you want to make sure you understand them.",
    "Be prepared to put in extra work after lectures - at least up to the mid-term. It can be pretty confusing - getting used to all the ecology terminology and theory if you have not done this before.",
    "If you don't have a background in ecology, make sure that you attend office hours, because the class can move very quickly if you don't have that type of background.",
    "You do not have to follow the methodology for doing a meta-analysis that the Prof provides. In fact, it will be impossible for many of the kinds of data that people will want to work on. Find a similar meta-analysis you understand and copy their methods.",
    "Don't take this class if you have no biology background, because it won't make any sense to you. It would be better to take the introductory ecology\/evolutionary biology class (which is also online) before considering further courses. For people with a biology background, I also would not recommend it unless a serious cap on the class size is put into place (like 30).",
    "Start on the meta-analysis in time",
    "Take excellent notes, preferably on your computer (because Skelly talks really fast and what he says won't be on the slides for future studying). Study in a group and work on homework assignments jointly to review key concepts.",
    "Stay on top of the reading. Keep summaries of all articles, methods\/hypotheses\/results that come out of the experiments. Form a study group and meet once a week\/once every two weeks just to practice fluency with ideas and concepts.",
    "Team up for the meta-analysis and start early.",
    "If problem sets are insufficient to reinforce key concepts, figure out ways of your own to consider how topics can be applied. If this course cannot be connected to your own research interests, it will not be as valuable to you. It is not really a foundational course, you must have a background in ecology before taking it, otherwise topics covered will not make sense.",
    "Really start reviewing papers for the meta-analysis project early. My partner and I had to read approximately 50 papers to decide which ones could be used for the analysis. We also had to change the focus of our paper several times as we read through the papers and realized what data was really available. It's a lot of work!",
    "Start the paper at least 1 month in advance. Start researching a paper topic at least 2 weeks in advance. Visit the professor in office hours.",
    "Considering the intense use of ecological models, students would be best prepared by reviewing some of the basic ecological models that were taught in college.",
    "Start on the meta-analysis early; you will get much more out of it than if you end up doing most of it in the last week or two. And do something that is interesting to you.",
    "They should come with some background in science and especially conservation biology. Some strength in maths will be helpful too.",
    "Start planning your meta-analysis early! Be proactive about seeking out help.",
    "Start the meta-analysis right away and really look for papers early on. Also, study groups for all assignments and test were essential. This class is good for people interested in models, in theory, in big ideas - not so much for people more bent on practical field work. Still useful though.",
    "Choose a partner wisely and start the paper early.",
    "\"Beware of the dog\".You have o read all of the assignments, and bea ready for the paper it will take long long time and they expect quality material from you.",
    "start your assignments early, ask a lot to the TA and to Skelly.",
    "This course requires a lot of time commitment and has heavy course load compared to others. Besides, prepare yourself for lectures and a big class size which may be a downer if you want it to be more discussion and participatory oriented.But, overall i would still advice anyone interested in conservation to take it. The Prof. is excellent and the topics covered are very relevant."
