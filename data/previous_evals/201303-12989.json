    "Exactly as the course title appears: Surviving War in the 20th Century\" -- each week we read material about a particular conflict in the 20th century and focused on themes of survival, especially after the formal conflict has ended.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student- especially for those interesting in WW1, WW2 and wanting a different take on the aftermaths.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It is a well constructed examination of the post-war period.",
    "It looks at important issues from a different perspective and tries to recontextualize what we think of as the postwar period.",
    "Would not recommend - the reading list was good, but course discussions either stated what we already read and did not delve particularly into the works or the issues they represented in a disciplined way."
