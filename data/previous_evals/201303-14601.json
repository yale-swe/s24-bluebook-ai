    "Amazing course. Take it, no matter your background. Lectures are compelling, and section in the YUAG is laid-back and fun. The two papers, midterm, and final are all manageable and graded fairly. You will learn so much and have fun along the way. Professor Raab is a wonderful lecturer and teacher. She finds just the right balance between personal passion and rigorous scholarship.",
    "This was by far my favorite class this semester. It was my first art history class at Yale, and I absolutely adored it. As my first introduction to art history, I didn't quite know what to expect, but the course lived up to and exceeded any expectations I had. Anyone who is interested in U.S. history andenjoys museums or looking at art will enjoy this course. Section in the gallery was a real treat, especially as a good number of the works we study are at YUAG. The class was also very small (only about 6 undergrads), which made for an intimate experience. I looked forward to lecture each week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sitting in a dim lecture hall, gazing at beautiful images blown up on a big screen while listening to Professor Raab's fascinating analyses of the images. For anyone interested in history or who has not yet explored art history, this is a good introductory course and, in my opinion, a better way to become familiar with art history than a large survey course. While the course spans over 200 years, it does not feel as though you are rushing through an overwhelming amount of material, yet you nevertheless emerge with a good sense of the aesthetic and thematic progression of American art from even before the nation's founding (the earliest piece studied was from the 1580s) through 1900, and a little beyond. The workload was manageable; not light, but not overbearing. Assignments included one short paper (formal visual analysis of an art piece, preferably in YUAG or somewhere where you could go observe the object firsthand), a longer 10-page paper about the same art object that incorporates a historical thesis, a mid-term, and final. Between 2-4 weekly readings were assigned (scholarly articles on art pieces or artists studied that week), but no reading responses were required.",
    "Solid introduction to American Art.",
    "Yes. I wouldn't suggest this if you've never taken an art history course before though. I definitely feel like previous knowledge is really important in this course. For the first year there were only 7 students. More people should definitely take it!",
    "Really interesting class for anyone"
