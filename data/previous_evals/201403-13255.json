    "The readings were very interesting and the essay topics are good. You will get a lot of practice reading and listening, some practice writing, and almost no practice speaking. There is tingxie every week, but other than that you are not required to know how to write the characters. Su laoshi has a lot of interesting stories to tell!",
    "If you are looking to improve your writing and reading skills, this course could do a lot for you. If you're looking for a well-structured class that will improve all aspects of your Chinese, do not take this class. Su Laoshi has a lot of interesting life experiences and personal connections to the text that you will hear all about--which is great and makes for some interesting stories, but don't expect to get a word in during class. As a non-heritage learner, this class was challenging but doable. Be prepared for some days with a very light workload and some with an incredibly heavy one.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 164 to fellow Chinese language learners. I would suggest though that they make sure they already have a high speaking level before they enter this class, as speaking level does not really improve here. I would summarize CHNS 164 as a Chinese language course taught through selections from notable works of Chinese literature from the last twenty years, centering around sex, love, femininity, women, and marriage in China. Extremely fascinating course for those who have taken some Chinese history already but never seen this more emotional side to the reform and opening up of the 1980s and 1990s."
