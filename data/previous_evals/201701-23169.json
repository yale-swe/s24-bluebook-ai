    "I learned how to construct a narrative. This consisted of mastering the basic elements of fiction, and then analyzing how authors use these techniques in their writing, before implementing them myself in a short story of my own.",
    "This class was FANTASTIC. I developed a strong understanding of narrative, dialogue, characterization, how to read, how to write, and how to learn. I absolutely loved it.",
    "This class goes through lots of literature in order to demonstrate essential elements of crafting a short story: plot, characterization, point of view, etc. It never feels too basic and leaves you with confidence in your ability to write a short story.",
    "I feel that this course definitely helped me improve as a writer and gave me a better sense of my own writing style, as well as what I need to work on.",
    "We read a sampling of the best works of fiction and analyzed how they function and succeed. After the course, I feel much more confident crafting my own fiction.",
    "I have learned how much skills I still need to acquire to become the writer I want to be.",
    "How to read\/evaluate books for structure, style, and characterization, and how to take these elements and use them to craft literary works of your own.",
    "This class definitely made me a better writer by making me more aware of story structure and made me think critically about elements of my stories.",
    "Thinking about literature structurally, how to read and interpret literature. How to write fiction while staying cognizant of structure and technique."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about writing in this course and I think my writing has improved substantially as a result. I now feel more confident in my writing, though I am also more aware of weaknesses and bad habits I have. Discussions in seminar were usually very interesting and not bogged down by over-interpretation of the texts. I also really enjoyed the workshop portion of the class and found it to be probably the most helpful aspect of the course. My only critique is that I think the reading list could probably be improved. I maintain that Jane Austen can teach us nothing about craft except for what not to do.",
    "It was an incredibly engaging seminar with a moderate to light amount of work that also demanded full student engagement. The professor created an environment of learning and discussion that I looked forward to every week. There were no weaknesses.",
    "The class was very enjoyable. The stories we read were interesting and great reads in their own right. Prof. Sexton was also a great instructor, and his wit and insight really added to my enjoyment of the class. It was a bit challenging to read some novels in one week, since we moved through them pretty quickly. The workshop portion of the class also uses up quite a bit of paper, so doing online comments might be more environmentally friendly.",
    "The course is divided into two distinct sectionsfirst, we read and analyze a sampling of fiction, then, we workshop our own short stories with each other. I felt that the first part of the course relied too heavily on the concepts of Prof. Sexton's book. Essentially we read the works analyzed in his book, and drew many of the same conclusions. While this knowledge was still effective, I would have wanted to go beyond a book I could have read on my own time (which suggests many of the books we read in class). The second half of the course was extremely effective. While I have been informally writing fiction for many years, this class was my first opportunity to show my work to others and hear their feedback. It was invaluable to see the way they comprehend my work and suggest improvements. I feel like a better writer now because I have learned to more seriously consider the reader.",
    "There is a lot of reading to be done, and sometimes it seems a little too much. However, the readings are very interesting, so I'm not sure it'd be wise to drop them.",
    "Strengths: exposure to lots of different types of novels, short stories, and literary pieces; receive large amounts of feedback on your final story through workshopping process; read peer work and learn from your classmates. Weaknesses: sometimes the reading is so much it's hard to absorb (e.g. reading Beloved over one weekend and having only 1 hour to discuss it); feedback throughout the course felt minimal until the end; you don't get grades until the very end of the course, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but might bother some.",
    "Strength: Helps you think about writing more formally and in a clearer way. Get good feedback since everyone DID read each other's work (maybe not all the literature texts though) Weakness: Could do with another round of workshopping or maybe a paired review exercise."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in creative writing. You will learn and improve in an environment that is at once reassuring and helpful.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. In a second. I would recommend this class to anyone from those who are committed to being writers to science majors who need an Wr.",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in creative writing, take this class. Professor Sexton is a very clear and engaging professor, and the class is structured in a way that is clear and helpful. It's also a great excuse to read some really wonderful short stories and novels.",
    "Yes! Take it! I would say that this was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes",
    "I would advise a student to think very carefully before taking the class. If you want to gain the knowledge learned in this course, read Prof. Sexton's book on reading and writing fiction. If you read that with the books on the syllabus, you're essentially done with half of this class. I would take this class if you're someone who wants to workshop their work very seriously. The type of workshopping that defines the latter part of the class is beneficial and funbut it is also not essential. You could also gather a group of friends to read your work, and mostly reap the same benefits.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to look for some tips on how to improve creative writing. I learned, however, that short stories are very different than novels, so don't expect the process to be the same.",
    "Yes! If you love reading and writing and want to become better at writing effective stories.",
    "I definitely, definitely would. Excellent class for anyone interested in gaining a more technical understanding of writing fiction.",
    "Take it if you want to learn how to write better and how to improve your writing more effectively. It's also a fun course with a less than stressful workload."
