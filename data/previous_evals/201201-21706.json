   "comments": [
    "A fun, friendly class where you will really learn a lot about the Vietnamese experience since 1975. The very beginning of the course is largely dedicated to tearing down the stereotypes every American has about Communism, Vietnam and the \"East\" -- once that's out of the way, the course becomes a really interesting look at issues from women's health to rural education to consumerism in a nominally socialist country.When I took it, the course had 8 students, who all had different perspectives -- a student from Vietnam, a couple Vietnamese-Americans, other internationals and non-Vietnamese Americans. It felt more like meeting with friends that a course, because the class had a really great environment and Harms' enthusiasm was really contagious to the students. This class makes learning fun.",
    "Postwar Vietnam is a great class to take regardless of a student's major. The anthropological perspective sheds new light on what is typically studied about Vietnam (read: the war)and the papers allow students to explore issues that they find interesting. A really fantastic class.",
    "Definitely take it if you have an interest in Vietnam or are planning to go in the future! It's a very very interesting class that will give you tools to think about politics, economics, cities, nations, gender and culture in a different way. Professor Harms is very dedicated and a very nice person who is excited to drive you through this learning process. I never felt bored in class and I felt like my previous notions ofwhat the state and society are were profoundly challenged.",
    "I recommend it for students who like small classes, interesting reading, and who genuinely likes to learn about Vietnam.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student because of the enthusiastic professor, the small class size and the broad yet complex subject matter."
