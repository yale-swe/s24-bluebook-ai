    "A broad sweep of British colonial architecture in the 17th to 19th century, covering India, North America and South Africa among other colonies. While examining the historic buildings in each of these places, we often discuss larger themes -- racial segregation, intercultural blending, and the mimicry of colonial masters, for example -- which are linked to architecture. Lectures are long (often 30 minutes overtime) and sometimes dry, but at the end, it is worth it."
