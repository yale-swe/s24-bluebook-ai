    "yes if required for major or interest in statistics; interesting and class, but it would be a lot of work for \"fun\" extra class",
    "This is much easier than Stat 241 with Pollard, which I took the term before. It follows the Rice textbook pretty closely, and problem sets are assigned right out of the book. There are all kinds of resources for someone who struggles with theory: TAs, detailed problem set solutions, the Rice textbook, plenty of office hours.The lectures were a little hard to follow. It's important to go back before the exam and ask yourself, \"OK. What was the point of that lecture? What's the skill hidden in there that she's going to ask me to reproduce?\" That's why the problem set solutions were so useful.On the first exam, you're allowed to bring in one page of notes. Two pages for the second exam, and three for the final.",
    "Take this if you need to for your major. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would summarize this course as a theoretical course for some of the fundamental topics in statistics. I would recommend this course with caution. More specifically, unless you have a strong and more current background in mathematics or statistics, this course may not be appropriate for you.",
    "This is an absolutely amazing class simply because Professor Chen is a superb professor. She's thoughtful, patient, and possess the uncanny ability to put herself in her students' shoes. Herstyle of lecturing is by far the most clear of any Yale professor I've ever had. This class is challenging, but it's also very reasonable. Professor Chen knows how to run this class. We had two midterms and a final, and we were allowed to prepare one 8''x11'' sheet with formulas and such for each exam. The exams were really tough, and time was almost always an issue, but the grading was always fair. I'd really recommend this class to anyone who wants to gain a thorough understanding of the intuition and reasoning behind basic statistical procedures like parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and regression. Highly recommended (if Prof. Chen is teaching it).",
    "Yes, yes and yes. If you've taken STAT 241, this is the perfect course to learn the theory behind it and actually kickstart your practical usage of it.",
    "Well taught, you will get a good understanding of the math behind basic statistics.",
    "I found the subject matter of this class fascinating, and for this reason I'm very glad I took it. However, if you are not already interested in learning the theory of statistics, this class will not convince you otherwise. When you shop the class, you'll get a good idea of how Professor Chen teaches: she covers the material, but it's not terribly exciting."
