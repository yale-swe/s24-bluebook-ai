   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course if you have a distinct interest in finance and markets. The class is very easy if you already know how the banking sector works and you keep up with current events in finance and economics. On the other hand, I can imagine this class to be a lot of work for someone who is just starting out in finance. I highly recommend this course simply because you cover some of the most important topics in macroeconomics and finance. You write a 3-page, single-spaced paper approximately every week or more, which amounted to 7 papers in my semester. Again, if you've taken intermediate macroeconomics and you can listen to Bloomberg Radio and can follow the commentators, then you will have an interesting breeze in the class. If not, it'll be a bit more work. Overall, a 6 out of 10.",
    "Debates in Macroeconomics covers a wide variety of macroeconomic issues, making it unique among Econ department courses. The homework assignments, which involve taking a stance and arguing for it using evidence (as well as then taking the opposing side and arguing for that as well), work to improve your skills at writing economics-based arguments. This class was very rewarding, and I highly recommend it to all economics majors.",
    "It's a great class about the current macroeconomic challenges of today, both domestically and globally. You need some econ to understand the concepts, but it's not a math-based course. It requires good writing and good argument in order to do well.",
    "The BEST class I've taken at Yale. It is somewhat demanding (you write a 3 page paper every weekend)and they don't ease into it (the first week we discuss the Fed's ability to forecast crises) but it SO rewarding and worth it because at the end of each paper you have learned more about what's going on in the world... Suddenly you see economics IN APPLICATION and begin to form opinions about what's going on in the world! Every student should have to take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are seriously interested in practical topics in economics. Lots of current events as well.",
    "Excellent course. Great lecturers and informative lectures. Excellent course to take to connect macroeconomic coursework to real-world applications. Definitely recommend if you like macroeconomics, and still recommend shopping the course even if you don't like macro.",
    "Yes, take this class if you are an econ or international studies major.",
    "This class was terrible--especially since I had such high expectations for what it could have been. Instead of actually learning about how the macroeconomy operates, the class focused on reading exceptionally dry pdfs and listening to lectures that had little or no relation to the underlying material. The only clever and insightful speaker who ever spoke in front of our class was a visiting professor from Columbia--not a good sign. After working in a hedge fund this past summer, I can attest that neither Roach nor Tsyvinski could get themselves hired at any self-respecting global macro fund. Also, billing a class as being a \"debate\" is really deceptive if, you know, THE PROFESSORS NEVER DISAGREE ABOUT ANYTHING.Also, the problem sets were absurd. I am sorry but eight-pages (granted double spaced) every week seems a little excessive. Fortunately, I figured out after about three weeks that it was literally impossible not to get an A so long as you filled the page length. This is the worst sort of grading system: meaningless assignments that are only scored based off writing an arbitrary number of pages.Unless they get new and better professors to teach this class, avoid it like the plague.",
    "Great class to take if you're interested in learning more about real world economics and how the current economics literature can be applied to situations in Europe, the US and Asia.",
    "I don't always recommend classes from the Economic Department, but when I do, it's Econ 185.It's the BEST class I've taken at Yale.",
    "One of the best, if not the best, courses I have taken at Yale. Definitely the best econ class. It is a pretty low pressure class, but I learned so much about every relevant issue in macroecon today from both the academic perspective and a practical business perspective. I can comfortably talk about macroeconomic issues at length because of this class more so than any other econ course.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in learning more about macro with two great professors.",
    "Take it if you want to learn some less mainstream viewpoints on some macroeconomic concepts",
    "this course does not replace intermediate macro if you want theory heavy macro models but to have an idea of the major issues being discussed, and think critically about different sides of the debate, it is a one of a kind econ class",
    "They just go through most major issues and present the different arguments."
