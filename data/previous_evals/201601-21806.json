   "comments": [
    "Take it with Mark Brandon if offered.",
    "An overview on plate tectonic boundaries and the processes that occur along these places. If you are slightly interested in these ideas, I would recommend it. However, this year the course was not organized and therefore we did not cover everything we were supposed to.",
    "Course is disorganized but great trip",
    "I would highly recommend this course, as the trip is a great way to become interested in geology. It made me switch my major to G&G, in fact!",
    "This is a cool, low-stress lecture on plate tectonics accompanied by an incredible, memorable, highly-educational field trip. I would not take the class without the field trip. The course material is light, and probably best for frosh\/sophomores but still very beneficial for seniors without a strong background in solid earth science.",
    "The field trip is amazing! A great science credit, even if you don't have geology experience. No psets, but the result is ambiguous grading.",
    "I would recommend G&G 212. It's a great class for pretty much any level, science or non-science major. There are some difficult concepts, but the instructor's expectations are slightly lower for intro\/non-major students. Though you will still be challenged and expected to learn as much as you reasonably can and that means some concepts will be more confusing because there is an amount of assumed knowledge in the instructor's lectures. There is little structure to the course and the workload varies dramatically week by week. The Sicily field trip was fun, but you will be required to do field work, so it is not just a fun Spring Break vacation. And it is a serious geology field trip in which you will be expected to hike, climb and walk a lot. We were in the field rain or shine, warm or cold, with or without the proper attire or supplies.",
    "Global Tectonics is supposed to be a second-level geo course but a lot of the students hadn't taken any geology courses before. The students picked it up quickly but I think a lot more time ended up getting devoted to simple topics, which is frustrating if you're looking to get deeper. That said Mark's focus on what at first seem to be bizarrely specific phenomena broadens to cover some really important ideas that would be hard to find described so effectively in any textbook. Mark's teaching style isn't for everyone, but it was definitely worth it despite some of his more frustrating sidebars",
    "G&G 212 is a good geology course that offers you the trip of a lifetime. The material is very interesting. Definitely take it if you are interested in how the planets plates function and what effects they can have.",
    "G&G 212 is an interesting course on general tectonics. I've definitely learned a lot, but in the beginning it felt like a lot of the lectures were a little scattered, with a few diverging into random facts. Although I appreciated that, I also would have liked a little more focus. Sometimes I left feeling like lecture could have been summarized in a few sentences. That being said, Professor Brandon is incredibly helpful and excited to talk to students. Grading was pretty ambiguous until the end. You're basically ranked against your peers, so even though it's \"no indication of how well your responses are\" in absolute terms, that doesn't matter because in the end you're being compared. So if you're not a geology major, be prepared to spend a decent amount of time trying to find enough things to write about on your responses."
