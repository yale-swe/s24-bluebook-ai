   "comments": [
    "Ethics of Humanitarian Intervention involves a great deal of analyzes international human rights law and declarations and perceiving the strengths and weaknesses of these documents. The opportunity to write an amicus brief and a policy report in this class will undoubtedly be beneficial for those who are even remotely considering law school in the future. Even if one is not considering law, for that matter, the deep analytical skills that these tasks require can be of use in a number of academic areas.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it challenges you to think and you learn about a lot of great topics.",
    "This is an overview of humanitarian intervention in the last few years, along with the philosophy and ethics behind it. The reading is not difficult and the assignments are interesting and very relevant. No your average poli-sci seminar at all. Take it, especially if you want a fun and interesting class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student.1. The material is interesting and helpful2. You do not have to buy any books. YAY!!!3. The reading load is not to heavy and you will improve your writing and critical thinking.4. If you are interested in UN, human rights, humanitarian intervention.5. You get to discuss a lot of interesting and challenging questions that are very relevant to today's world.",
    "Yes",
    "good senior polisci seminar. only if u like papers tho",
    "To be honest, this is a really weird class. You are forced to do weekly reading responses which seem entirely useless. The class discussions hardly match up with the readings because so few people actually complete them. You only have to do two assignments: an amicus curiae brief and a country policy report. The first assignment is actually a lot of fun if you enjoy reading boring legal documents. The second assignment is kind of annoying considering you have to try to fix something like genocide in a 3rd world country (which is naturally hard to do).",
    "This is a very easy class with some interesting readings, and the assignments are actually generally enjoyable. But class itself was rather boring, and it often amounted to mutually reinforcing lamentations of the woes of various countries. Not especially intellectually stimulating, and I don't know how much I'll actually take away.",
    "If you need an easy polisci seminar, definitely take it. Very little work, very little reading. If you're looking for a really challenging, fulfilling, profound study of humanitarian intervention, do NOT take this seminar. You will end up, unfortunately, really disappointed.",
    "You will learn some things and the course is graded very, very reasonably. But do not take this class if you want to change the way you think about the world or learn something you have never been exposed to before.",
    "Take it! If you're curious about UN procedures, sovereignty, human rights, ethics in politics, and methods on intervention, this class is very helpful.",
    "if you're looking for an easy poli sci seminar, this is it. but there are weekly reading responses so you actually have to do some work. but she gives a lot of A's.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in humanitarian efforts or anyone who wishes to go to law school after college. It is a great way to practice real life policy evaluations and amicus curiae brief is one of the most fulfilling papers I've written at Yale so far."
