    "I developed valuable music analytic skills, as well as, the ability to discuss scholars within their cultural and historical context.",
    "Multiple critical lenses to evaluate music of the popular sphere and question the canonical forces of musical scholarship",
    "I learned how to articulate my thoughts about music on a higher level. Witnessing other students presentations was very insightful on how to talk about music.",
    "I learned about a wide range of intellectual frameworks that can be applied to pop music analysis. I incorporated these frameworks into my own analysis of a pop music album and considered how I could apply these frameworks across disciplines.",
    "I learned a variety of methods to approach the study of pop music, primarily from a cultural studies perspective and a music studies perspective."

    "I thought the student presentations were more enlightening and interesting than the visits of the guests in the first few weeks, with the notable exception of Daphne Brooks. Given that the class ran over two weeks you might consider reducing the guest presenters. We also had good discussions, but never quite enough time, so perhaps the student presentations could be shortened to half an hour. 20 minutes would be too little, but most people didn't have 45 minutes worth of arguments. The student presentations are central to the course, and give us an opportunity to put into practice what we've been talking about. They also make the course stand out. I didn't like the 7 o'clock class time at first, but I got used to it and liked it by the end of the semester. The readings were great, the albums presented on were interesting and varied, we had good discussions. I really enjoy the course, and it provided a lot to think about.",
    "This course was fantastic at helping students develop theoretical and historical foundations for music scholarship. However, the organization around albums and readings could have been better.",
    "one fewer assigned reading (on average) per week would better accommodate the structure of the course since half of the two hour seminar each week is devoted to a student presentation",
    "I loved the variety of readings in this course, and the array of critical frameworks felt clear and approachable. The album presentations were rich and engaging, and it was so great to spend so much time learning from each other and seeing how each student applied the frameworks discussed in the course differently depending on their prior academic background.",
    "I really enjoyed this course for the most part. I found the readings interesting, and the student presentations as well. However, I found it difficult to motivate myself to do the readings fully or properly when there was so little discussion time on the readings. The instructor had a lot of interesting ideas for the class - visiting professor presentations, reading discussion, and album presentations - but it felt like too much to fit into the class time. Most of my seminars take a full two hours to discuss the same amount of reading material. I also thought the course had a rather large workload, with two midterm papers, a final paper, an hour long presentation, and around 100(?) pages of reading a week. I didn't particularly mind, and I found all of it interesting, but my suggestion to the instructor would be to either assign about half as much reading, so it could be discussed in greater depth, or to shorten the album presentations to half an hour so there could be more discussion time. I felt like sometimes the discussions were not super lively, and speaking for myself at least, this is because I knew they would be short so I didn't do the reading as closely as I might have. Not very proud to admit it, but we have so much work to manage that these choices have to happen."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if theyre looking to incorporate music analytic skills into their work.",
    "Yes; the music department and its students would all benefit from critical consideration of the popular music of the present and immerse itself in the beautiful contemporary scholarship we read in this course",
    "Yes. One of the most insightful classes about music that I have taken during my time as a student. Also challenging intellectually",
    "Yes, if you want a critical approach to music scholarship, this is the perfect class.",
    "This course was a very rewarding overview of many frameworks of analysis as they apply to popular music: economic theory, sociology, sexuality and gender studies, cultural studies, political history, music theory, and more. Professor Veal keeps the discussions interesting and provocative, and the learning process is largely collaborative. The album presentation is a great, challenging exercise.",
    "Yes! This class had a nice combination of feeling laid back but also productive. It was nice to have a lot of free reign with the album presentations. The instructor was very good about giving written feedback on the two midterm writing assignments and arranging meetings to give oral feedback about the final project. His feedback was very detailed and helpful, which made me feel that the instructor was invested in my learning and also provided the intellectual rigor that was sometimes missing from class discussions (which I think was just an issue of time allotment as I said above). Also, it is always very beneficial to get to refine work in a seminar, so the process of turning the album presentation into a paper was valuable."
