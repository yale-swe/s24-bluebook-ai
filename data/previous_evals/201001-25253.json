   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. A must-take course for students in any Humanities major, and a great and accessible course for students in science\/math\/everything else that want to take a lit class without having to worry they might get a C.",
    "The syllabus is fantastic; it is also refreshing to study something \"irrational\" for once, since so much of Yale is focused on studying just the opposite. Even if you're not usually that into literature, the readings that this course boasts are difficult to resist.",
    "Fink is fantastic. This was my first introduction to Russian Literature. I now will read anything written by a Russian! The reading load is very manageable and the discussion is interesting. Just beware of the type of student that a class called \"The Irrational in Russian Literature\" attracts.",
    "TAKE IT! I can't tell people enough times that if Prof. Fink offers this class again to take it. It is such a great class.",
    "yes absolutely- if you have any interest in russin literature, or any kind of literature, or anything russian, take this class, it's really fun",
    "i would recommend it",
    "TAKE IT. If you like literature, or Russia, or just want to be a better person.",
    "A careful study of Russian Literature over time with a theme on the Irrational. Great professor, flexible writing assignments, and a nice foray into Russian history. The books are a bit too depression, however.",
    "Absolutely; this course was phenomenal. The texts are fantastic and rich for discussion. Professor Fink is excellent. This course is an incredible exploration of the complex natures of the irrationalities that inform Russian literature, and is one of the most engaging, satisfying courses I have taken at Yale. If it is offered again, do not hesitate! Take this course! It was brilliant!",
    "Yes, absolutely take the class.",
    "Take it! There are few books in this course that you won't enjoy reading, and the class discussions are some of the best I've had at Yale."
