    "Great introduction to metrics.",
    "very well organized.. i'm very satisfied!",
    "It is not an applied class. It is for people who are interested in the theory of econometrics, not the use of econometrics.",
    "Yes, although I would recommend taking a LOT of math beforehand. Also, the course was much more theory-focused than I expected. It taught almost nothing that was useful for my actual research, which was somewhat frustrating. I would certainly not recommend ECON 550 for those interested in learning econometrics in an \"applied\" setting.",
    "Econ 550 is a very theoretical course that requires quite a lot of prior preparation in mathematical theory, including set theory, measure theory, real analysis, and advanced matrix algebra. I would not recommend this course to any student who has not taken a theory-based mathematics course and is comfortable with various notations used in theoretical mathematics. I would also not recommend this course to anyone who is looking to be an applied researcher, as the focus is really theory and mathematics, not intuition or applications of important econometric tools.That said, for anyone comfortable with theoretical mathematics, this course will provide an introduction to the basic concepts in mathematical statistics and econometrics.",
    "A solid course for the foundation of probability and statistics, which lays the ground for further econometrics study.",
    "I would recommend this course. It gives a very solid foundation for econometrics.",
    "Yes. It's highly theoretical, but enjoyable.",
    "The material covered in this course and homework are hard, but I will recommend this course to another student because this course will make him understand the background of econometrics deeper than he will expect."

   "comments": [
    "It really helped me in building up a good foundation in probability and statistics. It's a fundamental step to more advanced econometric class.",
    "this is a great course!",
    "This was not particularly useful for me as a more applied researcher.",
    "To be honest, it was probably not very helpful for my research. To be fair, however, I don't think it was meant to be useful. I think it was more intended to provide a mathematical grounding in econometric theory for those who will pursue the discipline further.",
    "Definitely. A great introduction to the theory of econometrics.",
    "I hadn't had a basic course in econometrics, and this one was very well rounded so I feel much more comfortable in this area.",
    "I am using econometrics in my job but I did not know the background much. With this course, I learned a lot of background and made me understood how the methods I am using works. This will enable me to implement practical research more precisely."
