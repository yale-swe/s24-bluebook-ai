   "comments": [
    "I highly, highly, highly recommend this class for anyone interested in hearing an African perspective of African history and culture.",
    "I highly recommend the class.",
    "Great, easy class to take if you are at all interesting in it. Won't go in depth with the subject, just a broad exposure to Nigeria as a whole. Take it.",
    "Take this course! Professor Adesola is one of the funniest professors I have taken at Yale. It was great to have a comedic relief class to alleviate the stress of my other classes.",
    "This was a great and an entertaining class. The workload is very doable and I'm really glad we have papers instead of final exams. Professor Seye is a wonderful lecturer. Even though it has a workload, you still learn a lot without the stress of your other classes. Don't judge the professor based upon his accent. You get used to it, and it will be difficult to find a class as reward and down to earth as \"Nigeria and its Diaspora. 5\/5.",
    "wonderful class, fun with Prof. Adesola",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if they are sure that they are interested in learning about Nigeria specifically. The class is pretty easy, and I took the class expecting that the information provided, though specific, would have other applications. While I could extrapolate bigger trends on my own, this was not the focus of the class, and while I learned a great deal, this class did not have a fundamental impact on my learning.",
    "Pretty chill class with a diverse group of students. It's a lecture, but it's small enough for discussions to occur. You may already know a lot of the stuff taught if you're Nigerian, but I still learned plenty of new things. The weekly two-page reading responses got annoying, but they weren't difficult. There are also two 6-page essays and a Powerpoint presentation. I'd recommend the class to anyone who's interested in Nigeria and\/or wants to add a relatively stress-free class to his\/her schedule. We also cooked a Nigerian meal together at the end of the semester, which was a nice way to wrap up the year.",
    "I recommend this course if you want a general overview of Nigeria. It is a great social science credit ad well."
