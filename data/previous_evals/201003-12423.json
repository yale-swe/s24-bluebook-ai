   "comments": [
    "I took this as a writing credit as I am not the biggest writer and only four short papers (300 words) and one long paper (5-6 pages) are assigned. You do have to put in quite a lot of effort on the small amount of writing you do to get very good grades on the papers. I actually learned a lot about how to improve my writing even though I did not write that much.Otherwise, the material is interesting and there is not too much work. David Gelernter is also super interesting.I recommend this class if you want an easy writing credit or if you want a fun and interesting class. No computer science knowledge is necessary.",
    "Yes, if you want writing credit that's not too much work and you enjoy thinking\/talking about whether you can create a mind out of software.",
    "The fact that we were assigned a few number of assignments meant each one counted for more which caused me to spend days writing a 300 word paper. I would recommend this class if looking for a writing credit that is very different from anything ever found at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it to CS majors. Is not a gut class.",
    "Yes, I would, but not as a gut. If you want to hear an interesting,logically founded perspective about the future, and learn how to write effectively, take this class.",
    "The class has a very narrow focus, examining the question \"Can a computer have a mind?\" for a whole semester. This is a philosophy class first and foremost; don't let the computer science designation fool you. The question is an interesting one, and the readings are often fascinating and thought-provoking. The lectures however (and they are lectures: despite the 25-student limit, there is no motivation to talk in class), are quite boring and repetitive. There is little amount of work (9 pages in total for a WR credit!) but the grading is quite strict and very unpredictable. We knew nothing about how we were doing in the class by the semester's midterm, only 15% of our grade by the credit\/d conversion deadline, and only 45% of the grade by the course drop deadline. I still have no idea what grade I'm getting in this class.",
    "Good class. You'll like it if the topic interests you. The workload is small but if you really think about the papers and the way you write, the class will take more time.",
    "This class covers the different schools of thought on AI: Can computers replicate human thought? The reading load is fairly light, and the papers seem short, but if you're writing them well, you'll have to spend as much time as a longer paper.Prof. Gelernter has very specific ideas about writing these. They should be concise and avoid all unnecessary words. After the first paper, you'll discover little peeves such as transition words. It turns out they are usually unneeded. This class doesn't foster your creative, flowery writing. It's a NO BS, 300-word, paper kind of class. If you can learn to write like that, and control it, you can easily improve your writing.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student-it gets very boring very fast. You argue about the same points class after class. Don't take it to make yourself a better writer either. Assignments are 300 words and Professor Gelernter doesn't help you become a better writer. If you don't write his way you're wrong. He tries to give examples of better sentences and words after every assignment in class, but it doesn't help anyone. On the bright side there is almost no work.Don't take it.",
    "The professor tends to make the class a long exposition of the reading you were suppose to do for class, without little if any discussion. This makes the classes long and tedious, and while the assignments are short, they are graded fairly harshly. No instruction is given on how to write in class, other than to write tersely.",
    "The course was interesting to be sure, but take note of a couple things. First, you will not finish the syllabus or even come close. We made it into the second week of October (on the syllabus) by the end of the course. Again, all interesting stuff, but not much of it. Second, the grading in this course is incredibly difficult. Gelernter has a very specific writing style he likes and he expects you to write in that way. I normally get good grades in classes that people say you have to struggle in, and I had to work my ass off to get above a C in this one. Be careful taking this course, and I definitely recommend doing it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "This class isn't for everyone. Shop it, and see how you feel about Gelernter\u0097if you don't like him, don't take the class. If you think he's interesting, intelligent or even just endearing, go for it.There aren't very many assignments, but they're really really hard. Gelernter's very particular about writing style. I think overall it was worth it, and that my writing improved, but don't be fooled into thinking it's a total gut. You still have to earn your grade.Plus you get to learn about interesting ideas! I feel more educated now.",
    "Very interesting, although the grading on the papers seemed a bit arbitrary at times. Overall, a very informative course.",
    "good.",
    "You should definitely avoid this course - it is one of the worst I have taken. Philosophy of mind is an interesting topic, but Professor Gelernter teaches the subject terribly. 2 hours on Wikipedia would serve a much better introduction, or simply purchase the course book (Hofstadter's \"Minds Eye\") and read it yourself. It's very managable.Throughout the semester Professor Gelernter covers less than 30 pages of reading. He lectures *very* slowly and rarely does more than summarize the 3 essays you will cover in the class. He doesn't present any interesting ideas or encourage thoughtful class discussion. We had very few stimulating conversations in class and student participation pretty much died completely by the end of the semester due to the lack of new any new material to discuss.Additionally, papers grades are based completely on the professors long list of English language pet peeves. He will not consider your content at all. If you do take this course, try to dumb down your papers as much as possible and stick to summarizing ideas covered in class instead of presenting your own - you will receive much better grades.Finally, I found the professor personally unlikable, which makes it difficult to recommend his seminar. He is very conceited - for example, he often drops derogatory remarks when no one in the class has read a piece of literature referenced in a lecture. He is also unable to consider alternative points of view (hint: write from the anticomputationalist perpective if you want good grades).I am very disappointed that I wasted a class on CS150, don't make the same mistake."
