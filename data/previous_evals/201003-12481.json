    "I liked this lab more than CHEM 119. All of the labs went according to plan and were fairly straightforward. This lab does require more preparation time as you have to write up a prelab. However, there are no weekly quizzes which is a nice break for gen chem lab. Lab reports are not too involved. Only one writeup is a full lab report, but you get two weeks to work on it. There is a cumulative final at the end which is trickier than you might expect. Don't blow off studying.",
    "MUCH BETTER THAN GEN CHEM LAB. Labs are shorter, and there isn't a full report every week. There are no quizzes. There is a written final MC exam, but it's reasonable.",
    "I would recommend this lab class as i believe it was structured well and was fairly enjoyable for a lab.",
    "Much less work than CHEM116L, but also less straight-forward.",
    "its WAY WAY WAY WAY better than 119L; way more relaxed, way more interesting",
    "You should take this course if you 1) need it, or 2) are fond of paying excessive detail to useless things, such as using 0.25 instead of .25 and \"the flask was allowed to cool\" instead of \"the flask was let cool\". Because you may lose points if you commit such grave errors.",
    "Great introductory class; simple procedures; should be fairly easy to earn a good grade and learn a lot if you do what your TA, the professor, and the course packet tell you to.Note however, that sometimes the course packets sample information is not all inclusive, so if there is any doubt about what you should include, email your TA or the professor.",
    "Orgo lab is easily the most enjoyable lab I've taken at Yale in terms of the quality of the experiments and the way the class is run. The experiments are well coordinated with the lecture and the material studied in lab helped to strengthen concepts from 220 lecture. Unfortunately, it's graded incredibly (and usually unfairly\/unnecessarily) strictly, which makes stressing over grades and being obsessive over details normal in this class. It is absolutely incomprehensible that this class is only worth 0.5 credits.",
    "It organic lab. You start with a white powder or a clear liquid, add something to it, heat it, cool it, filter it, and get another different white powder or clear liquid. Whoopie. This lab is very technique based and the TAs can be very harsh with grading, so make sure you follow the samples and ask your TA questions about what they want. Overall not bad, just not exciting.",
    "take it only if you need to, obviously. the grading was nitpicking, but the actual lab wasn't too bad.",
    "it is lab that is more fun than most.",
    "Orgo itself is not one of those classes you take to have fun, but if you have to take it, just know that thelab isn't that bad. There aren't annoying pre-lab quizzes like in Chem 116 or Chem 119, though you do need spend some time to prepare before lab itself.",
    "Good teaching lab -- I learned a lot, and DiMeglio is awesome and accessible. Weakness: nitpicky grading (often with unproportional point deductions) and, as most labs are, lots of busy work for a 0.5 credit lab.",
    "The Organic Chemistry Laboratory is a good course that is much more fun than general chemistry lab. I would definitely recommend the course, although you should beware the format of the final exam.",
    "Take only if you have to....",
    "If its required, Take it.Otherwise not that bad in terms of work. A good, involving lab!",
    "No one in their right mind would take this class if they didn't have to, but that being said it's not a bad lab. You get much more independence than in general chemistry, though the grading for post-labs can be ridiculously arbitrary and nit-picky. The lab environment is relaxing, and you'll almost always get out early if you know what you're doing.",
    "It isn't a choice for most students who have to take it.I wouldn't recommend it. The lab work was good, but there was a lot of pointless out of lab work, that was difficult, long, and graded harshly. It was more than half a credit of work and not worth it.However, my recommendation doesn't matter, because this class isn't really an option.",
    "Take it if you have to, or are interested in the subject matter enough. Don't take it for an easy lab grade, even if you understand the material. The grading schemes can end up being too arbitrary, and it's not worth stressing over that. At the same time, its a well run class and you will learn good concepts if you APPLY yourself to it. If you half-ass this, you will probably hurt.",
    "It's a lot of work but it is a requirement for pre-med (which is why I took it) and it's a very different experience from general chemistry lab. Sometimes lab can be frustrating when you don't get the results that you want but overall it's enjoyable and what you learn is really relevant and helpful in the lecture class.",
    "Chem 222L is a fairly laid-back, low pressure lab. The course manual was very well-written and clear. For the most part, the in-lab procedures were also pretty straightforward and easy. Between the EP's and postlab assignments, there was a fair amount of work. I though both were graded unnecessarily hard and that too much attention was paid to nitpicky details instead of general chemical concepts. Overall though, as far as labs go, this one was pretty good.",
    "Its a required lab, no one takes it for fun. That being said its not horrible and is probably one of the best chem labs at yale.",
    "Chem 222L is a very good lab. There is a lot of prep work that you must put in before going to lab each week, but then in the lab, things run very smoothly. This lab was a great way to be introduced to many of the organic chem lab techniques and I feel like I actually came away comfortable with performing the experiments.",
    "I liked the lab a lot more than I liked the lecture. I guess it was because it's more of a hands on thing. Lecture does help in understanding what goes on in lab, and vice versa. There was only one full lab report for the first semester, but still the prelab notes take a long time to get done. I had it on a Monday, so Sundays were always dead for me (doing orgo pset and lab all night). I definitely recommend taking it if youre doing the course. It's the fun part of orgo!",
    "This lab is somewhat fun and laid back and the workload isn't bad.",
    "Good introductory organic lab, not the most interesting labs though. Make sure you follow the format set out in the course packet because you will lose points for things like not putting your name on every page",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. The workload isn't a lot and you do actually learn a lot of lab techniques and you get to synthesize many different crystals and compounds!",
    "This lab course is so much better than the lecture course. I was engaged in each lab.",
    "orgo lab is not as bad a gen chem, you don't have to usually stay the whole time, there are no quizzes and only one full length report. The experiments actually feel like you are doing something. The final's grading was a bit annoying.",
    "It is actually a good and fun lab. I am guessing you have to take it for some reason. don't dread it it is not that bad just try to stay up to date on work",
    "Better than Gen Chem lab, you do have a final that is kind of difficult but manageable!",
    "Lab is not as bad as gen chem. But the grading is so harsh.",
    "Its annoying as is any lab class, but its not too much work",
    "I would definitely recommend Orgo Lab, not that it's likely that you have a choice. The time spent in lab was so much more reasonable than gen chem or bio, and the staff was super friendly and helpful. Write-ups and experimental plans did take considerable time, however. Grading can be nit-picky, so make sure you really do everything by the book.",
    "Good solid course in orgo lab techniques. very structured but very specific requirements for lab reports, but once you get the hang of the format, it's not bad.",
    "Do not take it in addition to an already rigorous courseload.",
    "a great lab if you have a great TA; a rather painful one if you don't. all in all, not too bad.",
    "Orgo lab is SO much more, exponentially better than gen. chem lab. The labs themselves are so much more enjoyable because you get to synthesize products and you can see the end result of all the work you put into it. The environment is also much more low-key. There's a radio playing and you work at your own pace, pretty much.I liked the format of the course a lot better too. I preferred the final exam at the end instead of weekly quizzes. Instead of quizzes, you turn in an experimental plan at the beginning of each lab, but those are really easy.",
    "The labs aren't as long as people say they will be. I enjoyed it much more than the actual orgo class. Compared to Gen Chem lab, the reports are much easier and more straightforward.",
    "Orgo lab is actually very manageable and pretty fun. There is only one full length lab report, and the rest of the weeks are dedicated to PLs and EPs.",
    "It is a well organized class that was a million times better than the lab that goes with the CHEM 114\/115 class. The lab experiments were straightforward, the lab assignments weren't too burdensome or too frequent, and the TAs were really good. The general chemistry lab was much more stressful and required so much more time. Also, the lab experiments in the general chemistry lab were very convoluted and conceptually difficult. This class, on the other hand,had simple labs that illustrated basic concepts and were quite short -- I often left lab 2 hours early. Although a lot of people are traumatized after the gen chem lab experience, this class is like a breath of fresh air. The professor is good, the TAs were fine, and the class was well structured. I was pleased with this class.",
    "It was fine. It was a good lab relative to other premed labs.",
    "yes its not that bad, the lab reports are so much better than inorganic",
    "you probably have to take this class. it is a lot more work than a one credit class and the grading is harsh but the class is scaled. triple check lab reports",
    "Great lab, much better than Gen. Chem lab.",
    "This is just a standard lab course; if you need it for a requirement then go for it; it isn't really very hard, and pretty light in the report area. The final multiple choice exam is pretty tough so stay on top of the material and concepts through the semester.",
    "CHEM 222L is typically taken as the accompanying lab to CHEM 220. Whether benchwork is enjoyable is largely dependent on personal preference. However, who the TF is also an additional factor into how much you can gain out of the class.",
    "Not exhausting like CHEM 119La. A manageable lab course that is meant to train you in basic organic chemistry lab technique and scientific writing for the second semester of organic chemistry. It is unfortunate that we receive feedback for our week one week after we submitted it, when we have already written and submitted another piece of our work. I'd recommend switching to an online feedback system so we can receive feedback sooner and perform better on post lab assignments and lab reports.",
    "It is a supplement to the lecture. I would recommend the class to someone fulfilling premed.",
    "A good lab that doesn't involve infinite amounts of work.",
    "Yes. This lab was relaxed and relatively fun. There wasn't much work outside of lab. Just some readings and a couple of short reports. It was a much more enjoyable experience than Chem119 Lab, which was hell. Take it!",
    "It's not that bad. A lot of work for a half credit, but as long as you follow the stupid rubrics exactly, you'll do well.",
    "Yes! Organic chemistry lab was a great experience, even though I had to take a Friday lab... It will be relatively painless as long as you read through the lab before hand and do the work you're supposed to do.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 222L to any student interested in chemistry. The course taught me that I love the chemistry laboratory. Although the course is a great deal of work, it is also fairly low stress. The professor and TAs are always willing to answer questions, understand mistakes made during labs, and are always willing to help. The class ties in well to organic chemistry lecture topics and helps teach the practical nature of the concepts in lecture.",
    "Chem 222L was an interesting course, although the grading of lab reports was sometimes frustrating. The course is scaled according to TA, however, and the final exam was not too difficult as long as you understand the ideas behind the experiments performed.",
    "The class is pretty fun and they often let you leave early. You will learn important techniques.But as with every lab class I've taken at Yale, the grading is terrible. The assignments are super easy but they take off points for REALLY stupid things, like not putting your name on every single page despite their being stapled together.Your grade will reflect how good you are at following the minutiae of their rubric, not how good you are at lab work.",
    "The methods you learn in orgo lab definitely do help what is taught in Orgo, especially in terms of mechanisms, IR, boiling points, etc.",
    "Very organized lab course with clear expectations and a fair amount of work. I think compared to Chem 119L, this is a lab that is actually 1\/2 a credit worth of work. It isn't too stressful and the support in the lab is absolutely fantastic! Just make sure to take the time to understand what you are doing each time so you don't have to cram for the final exam at the end!",
    "Just pray that your luck will get you a not-so-harsh TA. And if you do, try to switch out of it soon b\/c DiMeglio curved the same class the same way, no matter how harsh your TA is comparing to others. Yes, it is not fair, and thus it is life.",
    "Much better than Gen Chem lab. Not a psychotic race to test for the presence of various inorganic salts :)",
    "I thought all of the labs were pretty interesting and getting to use all the cool organic chem equipment felt really legit. If you like lab work, you'll probably enjoy this lab. I liked being able to generally work on my own instead of having someone walking me through every step. This let you work at your own pace. All the post lab assignments are very straightfoward, and you only have to write one formal lab report, so the outside work isn't too bad.",
    "are you pre-med?cool.so you have to take this right?yea.well, you're in luck. this is the best lab of the labs. king of the labs.prepare yourself for fractional distillation, IR spectroscopy, and hours and hours of taylor swift on the radio",
    "Take this lab if you need it for a requirement.",
    "This lab course is much better than the general chemistry lab- the TAs and instructors are better and the course is well organized. This was definitely the most enjoyable lab I've taken yet, and the workload isn't too excessive- only a few full lab reports are assigned.",
    "Organic Chemistry Lab I is far better than the Chem 116\/117 labs. The labs are more practical and straightforward, the reports and weekly workload are much more reasonable than Gen. Chem lab. Only take Chem 222L if required for your major or if you are premed, but the course is far more reasonable and enjoyable than the Gen. Chem equivalent.",
    "Easy for sophomores and hard for freshmen. Basically, if you do not know what the following terms mean - E. flask, distillation, Buchner funnel, titration - you are not prepared for this course. For that matter, if you have never had a chemistry lab before, you are not prepared for this course. A lot ofconcepts covered in this lab are not covered in the first semester of Freshmen organic chemistry, but are covered in sophomore organic chemistry. The techniques that are covered are very simple. There are a few synthesis labs but these are basic, as well. This lab isn't very exciting.",
    "You have to take it, but compared to other labs, not bad at all.",
    "I enjoyed this lab course, but I would have liked it a lot better with a different TA, one who was more involved.",
    "It is a great lab that teaches you several techniques essential for reactions and analysis in organic chemistry. It can be more enjoyable than the course itself. There is a lot of work at times, but it is well worth it.",
    "Not too much work. You have to do an experimental plan before every class which is really helpful to know exactly what you're doing. Grading can be annoying sometimes. I lost points during the semester for not putting my name on every page or putting things in the wrong order.",
    "It's a pretty good lab, less stressful than Gen Chem.Just always be prepared and read the manual carefully.",
    "Definitely take this lab course, christine wants to help you and the lab itself is pretty low key in comparison to other labs.",
    "Don't take it unless it's required for your major.",
    "CHEM222L was an organized and useful lab - and much nicer to students in the fact that it doesn't take so much time out of your afternoons (like CHEM119, for example). The grading is fair- just make sure to read directions several times over and make sure you get every detail - losing points on small things can add up on your assignments. Dr. DiMeglio is really nice - go to her if you have questions. Otherwise, this lab can actually be, well, fun.",
    "Some things to know about this course are that it isn't necessarily hard, but it is a fair amount of work and lab reports and assignments are graded pretty strictly. Expect to put in about 7+ hours a week when you have to do an Experimental Plan and a post-lab or lab report. And you cannot wing a lab; actually, putting time into an Experimental Plan will surely help your lab run more smoothly. Though it may be repetitive it is a necessary evil.",
    "its easier than regular chem lab but you will get a worse grade (despite doing more complete work and understanding the material better)",
    "Orgo Lab is great! More interesting and easier than Gen Chem Lab. Also, you only have two major reports and they are not bad at all.",
    "yes!",
    "Good lab course without too much work. Not a course to be taken just for pleasure but necessary and helpful for science majors and premed students. Labs don't take the full time, so that's a positive, and the labs are clear and more interesting than those in Gen Chem.",
    "GREAT LAB COURSE! This lab is pretty low key and you learn a lot.",
    "The course is not incredibly difficult but it does take a least a day each week to finish lab reports and experimental plans. Grading really depends on the TA. As long as you check answers with someone, you can probably expect good grades. Their is a written exam for the final. Careful reading of the lab manual makes it not too hard at all.",
    "I can't say I recommend it, but if you gotta take it, just do it.",
    "It's a good lab. It builds up your skills and in the end is kindof fun. I'd take it again without hesitation.",
    "This is an excellent lab, it won\u0092t stress you out too much and never takes longer than the allotted time.",
    "I feel thatmost people will take this as a prerequisite, so my comments here won't really matter. I personally didn't find it as interesting as I expected an organic chemistry lab to be. I think that more problem-solving in the class would have made it more interesting. This was largely a technique lab, where students just learned the basic organic chemistry lab techniques.",
    "It was organic chemistry lab. Some say it's the easiest and others say it's the hardest. I think that, like with any class, a great amount of work needs to be put in. And if you put in that work, you will do well. One piece of advice is to see what your TA expects of you. My TA wanted us to kinda go above and beyond what the Course Packet suggested, and knowing this sooner or later will result in you having a better grade. For those of you interested in the lab and the material itself, I think that latter half of the class was great in integrating organic chemistry concepts and putting them into practice. I would recommend this course to most people.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student; it was interesting and it helped me grasp organic chemistry concepts better than if I hadn't taken the course.",
    "Take this class. Believe it or not, it's pretty fun. Orgo lab is MUCH more chill than the intro chem labs, and you'll actually learn stuff instead of doing tedious work and write up 15 page lab write-ups. That said, there is some tedium involved (preparing Chemical Tables for EPs before every lab), but I hope that may be changed. Prof. DiMeglio is very approachable and organized, and the lab TAs (in my section, at least) were extremely helpful. They even play the radio during lab, and the station plays good music! All in all, I'd recommend this class.",
    "If you are taking organic chemistry, you should take this lab course.",
    "I would recommend for all pre-med students. This class does take up a lot of time though.",
    "Take it if you have to. It could be worse.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in Chem\/pre-med\/Chem-E who is willing to accept the rigor. There are alot of assignments in this laboratory and it is more intense than other 0.5 credit labs. However, the course material is interesting and quite useful.",
    "It's definitely not a bad lab to take.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but effectively conveys commonly used techniques in organic chemistry. As usual with labs, grading heavily punishes forformatting errors and the like, even over mistakes in the content of one's assignments.",
    "Fun and not very stressful. Plus there's music! Much better than CHEM 119L.",
    "Yes I would. it is much more fun than chem 119 L and you actually get to make real organic compounds. It is more hazardous and there are more things that can go wrong, but it is kind of fun thinking like an organic chemist. workload is a little tedious but manageable.",
    "I would summarize this class as a relatively relaxed lab that does complement the lecture quite well.",
    "Definitely recommend; Great exposure to lab techniques that I'm assuming are crucial to future orgo and bio classes. Workload was completely manageable. Labs correlated with lecture well.",
    "It's a great course but requires that you devote enough time to it!",
    "It's Organic Chemistry lab. Not as bad as the class, but still work.",
    "Yes - If you're premed you have to take it. But it's really not that bad...don't be scared away.",
    "Much better than Intro Chem Lab. No long lab lectures or weekly lab quizzes to deal with. The actual labs were much more engaging. And often, you get out after 2 or 3 hours.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed Chem 222L. The experiments were logical extensions of lecture topics and the results that students were able to obtain throughout the course of the lab were quite interesting. I also liked the focus on reaction schemes; they gave a purpose to the experiment and clarified topics covered in the lecture.",
    "It's good to see if one cn handle lab work.",
    "It's a lab, so you have to put a lot of time and effort for a half credit, but it's a lot better than General Chem lab. No pre-lab quizzes and the grading on lab reports is a bit harsher, but the labs themselves are a lot better than Gen Chem's.",
    "The lab is definately on the short side and is pretty low stress; however, be wary of the graded assignments. The class is curved and all assignments are graded meticously. You can lose points for stuff like not having the phrase \"continued on the next page\" on your EP to writing .75 instead of 0.75. I would encourage you to carefully read the part of the lab manual that deals with writing EP, LN, and reports and continously go back to review from time to time.",
    "It's the first half of orgo lab, you learn basic techniques and get to a few straightforward syntheses at the end. Fine class, just watch out for the grading. Make sure to follow every insane detail of the writing guides.",
    "Orgo lab is my favorite labs at Yale so far \u0097 geek out! I had a really fantastic TA (Alex X) who made the experience totally bearable and at times fun. TA selection isn't really up to you and that kind of sucks because they're in charge of everything from teaching to grading. On the bright side, you get out of lab before 4 on most days. But they're super nit-picky about the smallest things which makes it a huge pain in the derri\u00e8re in terms of grades.",
    "Enjoyable lab course. Written work for the course is not difficult--but pay attention to detail! Look at the lab manual carefully; what you need to do on lab assignments is spelled out.",
    "Yes. Even if you're just taking it for the distributional requirement, I would recommend it: it is relatively low pressure and very enjoyable. They even play music in the lab!",
    "Orgo lab is a pretty reasonable lab, wayyyy better than gen chem. The workload is not too bad and you get to be much more independent in lab.",
    "Only if it is a requirement or you really enjoy chemistry\/want to be a researcher."
