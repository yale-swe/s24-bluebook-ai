    "I highly recommend Intro Urban Design to those interested in how urban space is developed and how it can be critically approached.",
    "Good course. Very interesting material, good lecturer. Lectures are too long though. Should be two per week.",
    "I enjoyed the class enough, but I sometimes regret taking it. The professor is detached and lectures with really big words. I enjoyed doing the assignments, but overall the lectures were not great. I might be biased because I took Dolores Hayden's American Cultural Landscapes already and I had already learned 75% of the material in that class. If you enjoyed ACL then don't take this class. If you are looking for a mildly interesting class about something you don't know about, this might be cool!",
    "Introduction to Urban Design was an okay-to-good class, but felt rather disjointed. The class is a once-a-week, two-hour lecture (though in practice, one-and-a-half-hour). Professor Plattus lectures give fascinating arguments about the history of and present conversations in urban design, and are accessible to non-architecture majors. That said, the class was definitely geared towards grad students. The sections were laid-back but somewhat shallow, and the assignments and grade breakdown were often left unexplained. A whole lot of reading, most of which goes undiscussed.",
    "I would recommend this course. As a non-architecture, non-humanities major, I learned so much about urban design and urban planning, subjects I had long been fascinated by, but had never studied academically. The workload was not bad, just three assignments and reading (although the reading can be 100+ pages a week). The assignments all revolved around exploring different urban places' historical background, layout, sociopolitical meaning, people use of the space, etc. The lectures were what made the class stand out. If you take the course, definitely attend. If you are looking for a good credit\/d 5th course, this would be a fun one.",
    "If you're interested in history of cities and looking for a good survey course of urban spaces throughout the world, this is a good class. The readings and projects are very reasonable and Plattus is a great lecturer whose enthusiasm for the material makes the class a very interesting one."
