    "Advanced Spanish Grammar covers a lot of grammar that would seem odd and also contrary to what the rules that you learned in high school or in previous courses are. She covers any discrepancies in spoken and written language really well and takes the time to correct any mistake that you're making in class, as well. The homework exercises are long and can be a bit tedious, but they really drive home what you're supposed to be covering. I'd recommend it to someone who really wants to improve their written and spoken grammar-the course really does help with speaking, as well.",
    "As a student who took the Spanish Lang. AP, this class was not particularly difficult, but I really did find it interesting and useful. I guess the premise is sort of to look at the nonintuitive parts of Spanish grammar-the parts that don't translate well into English. For me, it was really useful. Definitely a low-pressure course though.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who really wants to improve their spanish grammar. It will not help very much for fluency however. It is also really work-intensive. Be prepared to spend more time than you ever have on a previous spanish course.",
    "Yes, it helps you be more aware of small grammar rules. While it can be a bit annoying at times, the work is completely manageable.",
    "Great class. Lots of work, but your grammar really does improve. Prof. Seymour is great and she really cares about the class. She does a good job of incorporating interesting stories, readings, art, and movies into the class, so its not just learning grammar from the book all day.",
    "advanced, spanish, grammar. yes if you're looking to gain a better understanding of grammar and writing then yes you've come to the right place."
