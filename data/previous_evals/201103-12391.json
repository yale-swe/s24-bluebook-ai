   "comments": [
    "You have to take it. It is boring. Read the book.",
    "As this course is dry. it may discourage you from mechanical engineering, but cope with it and more exciting classes will follow.",
    "If you're MENG, you have to take this. The material is useful. Prof. Schroers is awesome but not a good lecturer. The book is quite helpful in going over the gaps that you'll definitely have after lecture. Pretty standard engineering class: problem sets, midterm, final. Midterm wasn't too hard.",
    "A pretty good requirement class for MechE majors. I thought the material was pretty interesting and cool how, despite a variety of situations, it all boiled down to the same fundamental principles. It gives you a better idea of what an engineer does and considers and Schroers was a pretty engaged teacher. He liked to focus on the conceptual too which was nice as it means more of the class will stick. I wouldn't be too worried about taking this, I liked it.",
    "yes. take it with Jan if you can. he's a really nice guy and his class is pretty interesting, at least for me",
    "It isn't the best subject matter, but definitely useful later on.",
    "This class isn't an exciting one, but it's not terrible. Take it if you need to for your major.",
    "I loved this class. I think structural analysis is fascinating. It was so cool to learn at the end of the semester about why columns buckle, and how to predict when they will buckle. This class is essential for every engineer. Plus, Jan Schroers is good teacher and a good person to get to know. Highly recommended.",
    "Fair, but challenging course. Pretty interesting material, but it can also be very dry at times.",
    "You probably have to take this class. Don't take it otherwise, unless you have a very specific interest in structural mechanics. Some of the stuff is interesting, but not much.",
    "It's a required MechE class. I don't know why you would take it otherwise, but just know the first few weeks are the hardest.",
    "Meng 280 is a pretty dry course. There are weekly problem sets that are not too challenging and the exams were long, but doable.",
    "Mechanical Engineering 280 is a good course for mechanical engineers to take. It is pretty basic stuff related to the field but is interesting at the same time. If you are considering taking this course, it is probably because you have to take it so go ahead and take an enjoyable course on statics, beam bending, stress, tension, etc.",
    "The material itself is not too hard. As long as you attend the lectures and do the hw, you will do well on the tests. It will be hard t =o attend the lectures, but you should do it. He cares about how you conceptually understand the material so be sure to read the book too. There is only one midterm and then the final. So doing well on the midterm is important. It is one of the easier engineering classes.",
    "Straightforward, easy class. Taught directly out of the textbook. Take it because you need to, because material, while necessary, is not very interesting."
