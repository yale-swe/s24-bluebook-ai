    "First of all this class is amazing and you should take it. We read everything from personal essays, to anthropological articles, to novels (and we also watched films) that illuminated different facets of how blackness was experienced from before the colonial era in Latin America until today, all contributing to making this class basically one long historiography of blackness.",
    "analyzing literature, critical thinking of non-traditional sources",
    "Close reading skills, learning to research the author of a text before discussion.",
    "This was a really good course in an important subject area. I appreciated that the course did not focus on Afro-Latinidad as such, but on how blackness has and continues to be constructed and understood in Latin America. The title of Narratives of Blackness in Latin America was very accurate as it held true to this focus on what narratives have been and are present around blackness in Latin America. It was important to have this course, as blackness in Latin America is such an under-discussed and misunderstood presence in Latin America. By having us confront these complicated realities, I really felt like I learned something different and was forced to think more deeply and ask different questions about blackness in Latin America and blackness generally. We learned about this through a bunch of different texts and mediums such as film and music, and by writing short pieces on our thoughts each class to get us into the habit of writing, another valuable skill encouraged in the course."

   "comments": [
    "Great course - the texts were incredible! No suggestions",
    "I love how interdisciplinary the course is, weaving together art and history and theory. I honestly think I would have benefitted from having a weekly blog post assignment because that would force me to be accountable to doing the readings well in advance instead of having to rush to do them in a day or two, which doesn't leave much time to process them before class, which I think is necessary because the readings are pretty dense. I'd say the syllabus is fairly diverse but maybe I also would have wanted to read more authors from different countries in Latin America, because there are some that we read more from than others.",
    "Readings were great, but unfortunately I did not always feel that Prof. Ramirez was engaged with the class, which made it hard for me engage myself.",
    "This was a very strong course because it really focused on deeper questions than surface level ones, and pushed students to complicate and question their understandings of blackness in Latin America. I think the real strength of this course was in the narrative element that focused on constructions of blackness and race in general, as opposed to simply Afro-Latinx identity. It did this through a very interesting and varied syllabus, and a very discussion centered course that Professor Ramirez led really well, in pushing us to think about these deeper questions."

    "Yes! Professor Ramirez is excellent and made this course one of my favorites Ive taken at Yale. Its a pretty niche course but will inspire you to think more critically about all literature you consume. Professor Ramirez does a wonderful job of providing relevant historical background for every lesson so that everyone starts from a base-level of context. The essays are also pretty easy and fun to write.",
    "Yes! Take it. Learned a lot, read a lot of wonderful and difficult texts.",
    "Definitely, although I think Professor Ramirez is part of what makes the course and she won't be here next year so I can't say for sure whether or not it'll be as enriching. Also, I made the mistake of not making this course like a \"centerpiece\" of my semester, when it really needs to be. The readings are a lot and rich, so I would recommend taking this during a semester when you know you'll be able to devote a high percentage of your energy to it.",
    "yes!!",
    "Yes. I am so sad Ramirez is leaving. She leads classes better than most professors at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Unfortunately, I am not sure who would teach it, as Professor Ramirez is leaving for Brown, and I think her framework and style by which she taught the class were very much what made it a unique course. I am not sure if other professors would focus on the narrative aspect of blackness and its construction as she chose to, but I would welcome any professor stepping forward to do so, as I thought this was a real strength of the course. In addition, the strong emphasis on discussion I really enjoyed, and I learned a lot just from engaging with classmates and their ideas. The syllabus was really well assembled and really forced us to think more deeply about the themes of the course, leading to a lot of questions I think are hard to answer, but which are important questions to be thinking about. In short, I really loved this course, and am sad that Professor Ramirez is leaving as she was such a powerhouse of Caribbean Studies at Yale, but I would welcome another professor stepping forward to teach this course on such an important topic."
