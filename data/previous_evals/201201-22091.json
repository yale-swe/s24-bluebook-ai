    "Intermediate is a great followup to Intro Graphic Design - but be warned, it is much more difficult. Be prepared to put some serious time and thought into your work. Also be prepared to teach yourself programs like photoshop, illustrator and indesign if you don't already know them - the class does not instruct you in these tools so it's up to you to teach them to yourself. Sometimes it may seem like those with more technologically advanced skills are at an advantage, but it doesn't really matter as long as you are doing your best. Pamela is an incredible instructor, who will help you evaluate your own work with her serious critiques while at the same time help you see design in a whole new light. The class also had some amazing guest lecturers. Take it, but only if you're serious about putting some time into the class.",
    "This class is a great continuation of intro graphic design. Four hours is VERY long on Fridays, be forewarned. The projects aren't quite as fun as the ones in intro, but are still pretty good\/fun. Make sure to do the work every week when you get to longer projects, as it can add up quickly. The final project was very fun. Pamela brings in guest speakers occasionally who gave great insight into professional design.",
    "YES",
    "Yes I would. I thinks the you should get better at design on computer first, which will save you a lot of time.",
    "If you enjoyed Intro Graphic Design, please take this class! It's definitely a step up from intro, in that it involves more conceptual projects, with an emphasis on process; assigned readings on design; cool guest speakers\/critics; and a few mini field trips to other parts of campus. Yes, it took up my whole Friday, but if you really enjoy design, you won't mind too much. Pamela's great--she assigned interesting projects and in-class exercises and offered good advice during critiques. She probably could have spent more time explaining our projects, as she often didn't have time in class and sent the project assignments via email. I sometimes had to ask her to clarify some things through email, although she was always good about replying quickly. Even though this class is mostly-computer based, as opposed to Intro, don't think it requires any less time! (Or maybe only a little bit less.) The last two projects are incredibly time-consuming but also incredibly fun and rewarding."
