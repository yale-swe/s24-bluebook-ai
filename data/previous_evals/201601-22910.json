    "Take it. It is among the best courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's a useful introduction to the CP canon, and the research proposal exercise is very helpful.",
    "This course is indispensable for anyone hoping to take the CP exam, and I especially recommend it to theorists because of the question- and ethics-driven style that makes the new methodology feel less foreign."

    "Could not progress without it. I have learnt a lot and it has informed a lot of my research agenda moving forward.",
    "One of the msot helpful aspects of this course was the in-depth discussion on methods. It was great to have the opportunity to meet with authors of the books we read. This course, specifically knowledge learned about methods and how to conduct comparative study, will contribute to future research.",
    "The course did a lot to deepen my knowledge of the classic works and major themes of Comparative Politics. Learning what makes a good research proposal was extremely helpful.",
    "Before this course, I felt isolated from the non-theory side of the department, but I feel much more comfortable with and excited by the other kinds of research taking place in poli sci now."
