   "comments": [
    "The title \"Digital Photorealism\" and the accompanying description could never hope to do justice to all that this course entails. It is an introduction to computer graphics, yes, but it is so much more than that too. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in math, physics, art, technology, computer science and\/or computer graphics to strongly consider taking this class, especially since it is a seminar. It has probably one of the most enjoyable (and quite frankly, not very difficult) final projects you will ever do. Regardless of what you think of your own creative talent, by the end of the course, you will be able to create a 30 second 3D animation that will impress any layman who watches it. (Personally I'm one of those people who can't even colour in the lines, so I felt especially proud of myself at the creation of my animation).The course has a very appealing blend of mathematical problem solving, hands-on creativity (which even \"uncreative\" people can handle extremely well), and exposure to some of the most fascinating technology available today.While some of the lectures get a bit finicky and technical, by and large they is really accessible and easy to understand. The accompanying labs follow on nicely from the lectures; they are not woefully disconnected as in some other courses.The professor and TA are reasonably enthusiastic and extremely knowledgeable about the subject. However, if you want the course to involve you, YOU have to take responsibility. Unfortunately, the class and lectures don't really actively involve the students; that's not to say that you are prevented from asking questions and getting involved (you are totally free to do that; hence why I say it would be your responsibility), but that the classes and lectures almost never ask the students any direct questions.'Overall, a really cool and enjoyable class... and if you're worried about your grade, let me assure you that it is really easy to do well provided you just keep a solid work ethic: do all your homework, do the extremely few readings that you are supposed to do, and make sure your \"cheat-sheet\" for the two tests (yes, you are allowed those) is reasonably thorough.",
    "It won't be as difficult for someone who handles high school math well, since very basic geometry is involved. The animation part is very inspiring and entertaining, and it feels just awesome when you talk about your funny class assignments with friends.",
    "CS 079 is an interesting seminar on computer modeling and animation. Learn some of the principles of making animated movies and become familiar with the modeling software Maya.",
    "If you like animation, the class if very interesting. It has the creative aspects as well as calculations. The homework takes about 3 hours, and there is only one assignment per week. The homework may be difficult if you are not a logic\/math person, but if you go to the office hours it is very helpful. Overall, if you manage your time well, the class is not a big commitment.",
    "I would only reccomend this class to a freshman who needs an easy QR (math is just basic algebra). The format of the class is one lecture and one computer lab each week. The lectures are incredibly boring and the labs are often tedious. Although learning all about computer animation is very interesting (think Pixar movies) you only cover the basics. In addition, there is no next level animation class so there is no way to further develop your skills. Lastly, although it is a freshman seminar there is no discussion and at the end of the semester, you still don't know everyone's name. Grading is pretty easy- basically everyone gets an A or a B. Also, midterms are open note and the final project is to make your own animated short film. So in summary, only take this class if you want an easy A in a QR. Other than that, there are definitely better freshman seminars out there.",
    "Definitely. Don't be intimidated by the \"computer science\" label. I had little interest\/knowledge in this area and just wanted to learn something new and interesting. That is exactly what I accomplished with this course. There's ton of help available if you ever need it, and Prof. Dorsey is very kind and always willing to assist."
