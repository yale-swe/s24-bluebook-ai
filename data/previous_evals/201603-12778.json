   "comments": [
    "I learned to critically evaluate research, study the framework and traditions guiding research design, presentation, and communication, and to use it to develop research proposals of my own.",
    "This class does a great job of exposing you to a large body of decisions making literature. It helped me learn to analyze and critique experimental designs, as well as gain a better understanding of the process of writing an empirical paper. This is was a great class to take as I was in the beginning stages of writing my Cognitive Science senior thesis, both for the amount of literature you read and learning about writing a behavioral sciences paper."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: the seminar is very discussion based so the quality of each class depended heavily on the depth of insight of my classmates. Sometimes the breadth of backgrounds in the classroom meant people were on different wavelengths when it came to critical analysis of research. Strengths: Forces students to develop their thoughts critically, provides good introduction to multiple angles of study and gives a very thorough journey through some of the topics in JDM and is useful for deciding which are most interesting.",
    "Strengths: content of the literature we read, the very standard weekly format of writing responses for every paper and presenting three times throughout the semester, the largely student led classes, strong class discussions Weaknesses: There could be a little more guidance on the final paper and perhaps some intermediate deadlines so students can get on the writing track earlier in the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I recommend to anyone looking to get a bit more serious with academic literature, even if they don't have much prior experience with it. You'll be treated like an adult and your opinions will be taken seriously and critically. Good experience for any undergrads looking for a bit more engagement.",
    "As a senior Cognitive Science major, this class was incredible to take while in the process of starting my thesis. It exposes you to a ton of material on the topic and gives you a good background if you are going to do behavioral sciences research. The workload is not light, but very consistent and manageable; nothing unexpected ever. You write 3-4 reading responses about empirical papers each week, and present and lead a class discussion on three papers throughout the semester. Class discussions were generally very engaging. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable. Overall, I would definitely recommend the class, especially if you are or are planning to do research in this realm."
