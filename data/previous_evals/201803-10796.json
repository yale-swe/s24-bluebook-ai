   "comments": [
    "The content is challenging, however the workload is manageable given enough dedication and interest.",
    "Japanese 110 is extremely well taught (Saito is great), but very intensive. This could be because of my experience with romance languages coming in, but compared to other parallel language courses, I felt that studied more, learned more, and got a lot more out of it than other languages that I've taken @ Yale. I think the big thing is that homework could take you 2 hours of legitimately paying attention and doing work EVERY DAY, and if you do that, you'll be fine, and if you don't, you might struggle. Once you become adjusted to the scheduling system that the teachers use (they post a weekly agenda with homework and material to review for each day), keeping it organized is no problem, but 2 hours of daily work for a single class can be a hard habit to form. One thing that I feel is under-emphasized is how willing the professors are to work with you to resolve things you don't understand, whether you're reaching out to them via email or going to office hours, if you're willing to mark out time and talk with them, many of them are happy to continue working with you until you're comfortable with what's going on.",
    "A lot of work but overall good class. More writing practice would be helpful. It would make sense to consolidate the textbook and the course packet into one volume so we don't need to buy two versions of essentially the same book.",
    "strengths: well-organized syllabus, responsible teachers weakness: rules are too strict, especially regarding assignments",
    "The course was well-structured, well-taught and very intensive. It was great being able to learn so much in such a short time, instructors were also very accommodating with extra help.",
    "Its a lot of work, but the work has a good payoff in the end",
    "The course is well-organized every day, and every student is highly involved. The assignments are very interesting. But I think it might be even better if we could learn more Chinese characters per semester."

    "I would highly recommend! Very fun and stimulating, but also very rigorous. The professors are wonderful people and do their best to help the students learn the language and the culture!",
    "You'll learn Japanese, which is pretty rad.",
    "If you're interested in learning Japanese and prepared to work, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Whether you are interested in learning Japanese or simply satisfying the language requirement, this class is very fulfilling and engaging. The professors are very invested in their students and the lessons are masterfully crafted.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Japanese",
    "Yes because it is always useful to learn a new language, and this is a great program",
    "Of course to other students who are also interested in Japanese and Japanese cultures. The instructors are all energetic and friendly to students. And from the Japanese Table not only have I enjoyed speaking Japanese but also met a lot of other Japanese learners from different levels."
