   "comments": [
    "English 114 tries to teach you how to write. It is useful if you are not confident in your writing abilities, and if you like the topic, it can be interesting. However, the grading is entirely too harsh and class discussions focus on the readings, not on how to effectively write.",
    "Yah, a good way to get a writing credit. The amount of specific things I learned about writing from this course though...not that much. I'd say it just forces you to practice writing a lot, which is probably just good in itself. Just don't come in expecting to get like writing style tips per say, since we really didn't focus on that too much.",
    "Once the course's focus shifted to architecture, I was completely bored to tears during class. I loved learning about New Haven's history, but didn't have enough interest in architecture to enjoy the course to it's full potential. Professor Longmire is a kind man, but is not very good at leading a class discussion and is even worse when helping with writing. He can tell you what is wrong with your essay, but is not very good at helping you fix the problem. I'm sure there are better writing credits out there.",
    "The English 114 course on Yale and New Haven is actually a pretty interesting course. You will learn a lot about architecture that you probably never bargained for, but in a good way. Longmire is also a pretty fair professor.",
    "A decent introduction to college writing. I would recommend it to another student just because it's a pretty easy writing credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to freshmen because it really helps give you a solid foundation for writing in the future. I would encourage students tot find a section that particularly appeals to your interests.",
    "This section is a class I would HIGHLY recommend if you are interested in getting a more intimate understanding of the environment you live in. It can at times involve architectural philosophy or cultural history, and it's only towards the end of the semester that it all really seems to come together in a relevant and relatable way, but I found it to be a singularly positive experience. I learned a lot about the subject under discussion. That said, I'm not sure my writing changed all that much over the course of the semester. Still a great experience.",
    "Be aware that a lot of locals take this class (people from New Haven and the nearby area). Unless you know a lot about campus and\/or New Haven and CT history, you might feel a little behind from the people around you. Of course you don't have to know anything to take the class! And you definitely will learn a lot. But it's something to be aware of.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any who are interested in architecture, urban development or New Haven. I can sense that my writing has improved greatly from taking this course."
