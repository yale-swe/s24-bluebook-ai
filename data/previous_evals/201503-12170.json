    "Its a lot of reading and researching and only a small part is writing. Other than that it is what you would expect it to be.",
    "I think taking a yearlong thesis is definitely more rewarding than taking only a semester long one. It allows you to study the material more in depth and form a closer relationship with your advisor."
