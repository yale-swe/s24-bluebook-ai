    "Introductory finance class (more quantitative version than ECON252). You learn basic bond\/stock pricing and a few simple models of investor behavior. It's not actually worth the time to go to class because it is past SSS at 9AM and the notes are extensive. Beware that there is a second midterm on the last day of class, which sucks a lot. The professor is a funny, interesting, arrogant guy, but it's much more efficient to learn from his notes than from him personally. Also, there are like 300 people taking the course, half of which are humanities majors hoping this class will somehow get them a Goldman job, so the curve is extremely gracious (53+ for B or higher on the midterm).",
    "Horribly confusing and difficult...unless you know this stuff already you will struggle mightily. And if you know this stuff already, why are you taking the course?",
    "The material was interesting, but I was ultimately disappointed by the course. The lectures were not very helpful, since the only interesting parts were when the professor talked highly of himself. The notes are quite poorly written, so your main resources are the TAs (if you find the right one). The homework assignments and tests are often just a regurgitation of lecture examples, so sometimes I wonder whether I can actually work out real finance problems outside of Econ 251. You can tell which problems on the exams are not mere carbon copies of p-sets\/lectures because the scores on those problems are about 50% lower. Another problem is that the length of homework assignments are highly unpredictable, so you may have a terrible week and then almost nothing to do. Despite the less-than-ideal structure of the course, this is a good course to take if you are interested in more research-oriented or quantitative finance.",
    "Take it if bond arbitrage sounds exciting to you.",
    "Be prepared for all-nighters and brutal exam, but yes.",
    "This course is fantastic! Professor Geanakoplos designs certain psets around current event topics in economics and finance, and it's amazing that he can take current economic crises and offer concrete solutions using only the notation of an introductory finance course.",
    "I guess I'd recommend it. The problem sets are a little time consuming though.",
    "Lol so here's what you're going to learn:Present valueSome financial termsBit of equilibrium theoryStuff about bonds and mortgagesEh other random stuffYeah why not? It's not a very hard class, I never went to lecture and psets were usually easy. Also the curve is amazing! It's not easy to get an A (like solid A) but getting a 50% raw score gives you like a b+. So if you take it credit d like a lot of people, it's almost impossible to not get a c-.That being said, idk how much you're going to learn taking it c\/d\/f.Also, I had a strong math background. If you're not good at math or thinking logically this might be a struggle (the math is basic but you need to think logically).",
    "Yes, if you're interested in a financial career, I suggest you take this class to have a taste of what you're getting yourself into.",
    "Absolutely take it.",
    "Great class but very Math intensive. It's basically multivariable linear algebra combined with Present Value.I'd encourage taking it.",
    "The class itself teaches such a breadth of financial knowledge (asset pricing, hedging, financial equilibrium, present value) you'll have a very good idea of the math that goes on behind trading. It's fascinating stuff, once (if) you get it. The whole class is very mathy, but simple math; it's the concepts that will elude and frustrate you. The second half of the course will be much more comprehensible if you've had statistics.Watch out; John G is not exactly one of those nice professors who will let you get away with asking a dumb question in class.John G goes way too fast for students to comprehend. Normal people can't muster the brainpower to keep up with him. It's a bit daunting.Once you get the concepts after hours of long toil, the math is beautiful and simple. Until he throws a curveball at you, as he does every pset.Make sure you get a solid TA whom you can stalk, as you inevitably will, to eke out help for the psets. They will take you entire days to do the small fraction of them you can do. The midterms are no better, but the curve will save you.The lectures are all online, but I always come to class to hear John G say something self-important. His commentary on the financial world is so pompous it's funny. By the second lecture, you'll know all about how he almost became partner at Goldman Sachs, that John G should rightly be running the world and that Larry Summers is an idiot.",
    "Not what you think it is. You're better off taking something at the SOM.",
    "Probably not. Firstly, I would advise against taking it as a freshman: a micro course definitely wasn't needed, but it would have been a great help. Do not take this course if you're not legitimately interested in potentially doing finance in the future - problem sets need a great deal of work, especially since the professor tends to go a bit fast during lecture. That being said, the course is very quantitative and much more like a physics course than a high school econ course - once you get the stuff down, most of the midterms and final should be easy enough.",
    "Be prepared to WORK. This is a really hard class, but you'll learn a lot of useful stuff if you study adequately. Also you should be willing and able to absorb lots of information in lecture at 9am. Overall, though, this is one of the more practical classes I've taken at Yale, which is a nice change.",
    "For most of the year, only 20ish% of the seats in Davies were filled during lecture. I think that is indicative of the way it is taught. The lectures are monotonous and all over the place. Listening to Prof G. lecture for extended periods of time is super difficult. But, the material is all very interesting and presented in a comprehensive way. Prof G clearly knows the material, and he will make sure you know that he knows, but by the end of the semester you will have a solid grasp of the basics of financial theory. The work is similar to any other econ lecture. Two midterms (with one ridiculously scheduled for the last day of classes) and weekly problem sets.",
    "a lot of hard work is required but its important material",
    "I would recommend this to other students who are econ majors and considering finance, and have a pretty open semester. Otherwise, it's too intensive.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Prof G seems out of touch with what students need to succeed in a course like this. The lectures are incohesive and it takes a TON of work on the student's part to get the material and do well on the psets and tests. I even took it CR\/D and put in more work than most of my other classes... and still didn't do nearly well enough ot switch it to a letter grade. Unless this is your jam, stay away.",
    "Take this class if you are mildly interested in finance and can take a little fascinating mathematics. The class is one of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "A lot of work for this class. Problem sets will take forever and work is not easy or straightforward at all. Be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to understand the material.",
    "Financial theory is an interesting class, the workload is reasonable, Geanakoplos is great but doesn't always present his thoughts clearly during lecture.",
    "Do not take this class, unless you really want long problem sets and difficult material! It's good if you want to have a theoretical basis for understanding what goes on in finance, but in general, if you want to learn finance, the things you learn aren't completely practical!",
    "It's absolutely worth your time. a) John G is just a lot of fun.. he's your quintessential nerdy econ PhD that become fabulously wealthy from finance and now is a bit arrogant, often unknowingly so. b) You actually learn stuff about WHY some of these economic events happen, i.e. mortgage crisis and whatnot. You do the math, you understand the underlying cause and effect relationships. I will mention though that there actually is a good amount of math involved. You should be comfortable with applying (simple) math concepts quickly. You aren't solving differential equations, but you need to be able to look at some algebraic expression and instantly understand the directionality of the different variables there.",
    "I hated this class.",
    "Great to take, especially if you're sort of mathy and want to know more about finance. The exams are a real pain the in the ass - just very long and algebra heavy which is annoying. The problem sets are not too bad and force you to learn the material which is good.",
    "A class to understand how to make money at an arbitrage trading hedge fund. If you like math or you're doing quants for a financial firm over the summer, you might want to take it. If you're doing anything else (even in finance), definitely don't. You'll be disappointed.Problem sets are tough, especially towards the end, and the midterms are very hard but the curve is generous.",
    "The material is very interesting and highly relevant to anyone who actually wants to get a better understanding of the financial markets, especially form a HedgeFund manager's perspective. This is way more interesting and demanding than intermediate economics courses.",
    "Only if you want to go into Hedge Fund",
    "I think there are better classes to take. The lectures aren't always so helpful, and the notes often seem unrelated to the problem sets. If you do the work and keep up with the class, you will get something out of it by the end--it's just a long slog until you get there.",
    "Absolutely recommended. It's a necessary economics class to take if you're considering going into asset management ever in your life. It gives you a good conceptual basis of the pricing of a ton of different financial instruments (stocks, options, bonds, mortgages, marriages). Problem sets are pretty difficult and make for some late nights, but curve on the second midterm was pretty generous. Take it!",
    "It is a pretty hard course and a lot of work. The problem sets are long and take a long time and can be pretty difficult. Take it if you are interested in the material.",
    "Do not take it if you're not willing to put in several hours every week on a PSet and many more to review and understand the material. In general if you don't have to and aren't willing to put in a lot of work don't take it.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this class. Not as useful as it sounds and a lot of stress.",
    "Hard and long psets. Cool lecture in which the professor loves to show off his hedge fund company and his theory. Cool professor and some interesting lectures. Gives a general knowledge about financial products. Take it Credit D if you're just trying to gain some knowledge about finance.",
    "This class was extremely difficult, but ultimately worth the effort. One important thing to know going in is that this class is totally theoretical. I don't think that I was prepared for the amount of math and theory that went into the class. A deep understanding of Excel will help, but even then you will have to learn on the fly in this class. You definitely feel accomplished coming out of this class, but it is a long hard ride.",
    "Take Econ 251 if you've already taken a few econ courses. There is no requirement for intermediate micro, but it might help if you've done that already. Otherwise, the course is pretty good if you're interested in the less sexier sides of finance, like bonds and mortgages.",
    "Yes, one of the best courses I have taken at Yale!",
    "ECON 251 is an introduction to the pricing of financial instruments. It is very much grounded in theory and thus doesn't do much in the way of looking at how things are priced in the real world, though Professor Geanakoplos does put in his own bits of insight about that (seeing as he runs his own hedge fund). The problem sets were manageable, and the exams were pretty straightforward (with the exception of the second one).",
    "This class is a must if you want to work in finance. It is a great great background, so I really recommend it. However, be prepared for a sometimes tedious class.",
    "This is not a fun class. You will be confused, you will be frustrated and you will spend hours on problem sets (which are graded out of three, meaning that to get a good grade it has to be near-perfect). Professor Geanakoplos is endearingly egotistical. Exams this year have been a bit erratic as well. Was it worth it? I'm not sure.",
    "Overall, if you have any interest in finance, take this class, although be prepared to work hard for it. This course is provides a very good framework for finance \u0096 you learn about many of the concepts you here on CNN money or the Wall St. Journal, such as hedging, CAPM model, and valuations of assets.However, be warned that this course is VERY difficult. Problem sets usually are worked on through the day of, and exams are very long for a 75 minute time frame (final is 3 and half hours). Lectures and lecture notes were not always the most helpful in understanding the material, until you read the notes multiple times, so much of the learning comes from repeated exposure and practice.Professor Geanakoplos tries to help his students understand the material as best as he can, but does not always connect in his teaching. Lectures were often times confusing either because (1) he wrote on the chalkboard in not very legible size 14 font (which only the front row could read) or (2) he skims through his powerpoint lectures so quickly and erratically that you can barely even read the slides, not to mention take notes.",
    "Geanakoplos is a good lecturer, but the best part of his lectures are his jokes and stories. The course lectures are available online, yes, but do still try to go. It's worth it.",
    "Take it Credit\/D!",
    "This course is not easy. That being said, it is a one of a kind course at Yale.",
    "Good class. Tough at times, but it's interesting and worth taking. Definitely need something of a math background to take this class though. Can do it without one, but you won't understand his proofs in class at all.",
    "If you are good at math and enjoy the subject take it. Take it credit d if you're just interested in the subject.",
    "Great class, really interesting syllabus. The math is a non-issue.",
    "Take this class for credit ONLY if you've had intermediate micro because John G goes fast. If you've had the necessary preparation (aka Econ 121), it's a great class because the material is really interesting. It's a huge lecture so it's easy to be lost-if you're struggling with a concept, go to office hours and ask for help! most of the TA's were incredibly smart and good at explaining everything.",
    "tl;dr: pretty good content; good for more quantitative finance people as well as people who want to understand how we price things. Class may not be worth attending, however.An overview of how to price things: starts with general equilibrium (Intermediate Microeconomics), and then applies it to multiple generations of people, risky assets. Also teaches you how to price mortgages, bonds, etc. with uncertainty. Ends with how to put together a portfolio.Overall, good content, and useful if you want to work in finance\/manage your own money. The lecture notes are really nice too, and if you know someone who's taken it already, ask for the lecture notes. They perhaps beat the lectures, which were DISAPPOINTING.",
    "No",
    "The material itself is so interesting and so important. In a way, I think every economics major (an other students who are have the math skills) should take this class because it may be the only finance class that they will ever take and it's so important to understand the basis of our financial system. It's also great to hear Professor Genakoplos' personal stories (especially those about his secretary) since he has so much experience in the field and is so successful. Unfortunately, he is not the best at explaining concepts in class, and so I often leave lecture without really understanding what happened. It's easy to fall behind because even if you go to lecture (which I ended up often skipping)you have to read his lecture notes aka textbook in order to really understand the material. The problem sets were long and arduous, but necessary because I think 70-80% of my learning happened while doing the psets. Do them! Section is super important too so pick your TA carefully!",
    "I would definitely take this class if you are interested in how financial instruments work mathematically. The math really isn't complicated, but the concepts can be confusing at times.",
    "Great course, you will have a much better understanding of finance after taking this class. Lectures are very entertaining. Professor G tells excellent stories from his life as a hedge fund manager. Professor G's supplementary sections on Sunday evenings were helpful in solidifying the material. Problem set answer keys and exam answer keys were terribly written and frequently had incorrect answers. This was a pain in studying for the exam. That said, the exams were fair.",
    "I ended up taking this course Cr\/D\/F, which seems like a great decision in hindsight. The last 3rd of the course gets very hectic and the problem sets get very long. If you're interested in the subject, definitely take it. If you just want to show potential employers you know some amount of finance, don't take it- you're getting more than you bargained for. John G and his ego are quite entertaining, and I truly learned a lot in the course (coming in with almost no background in the subject). The mid-terms and final are hard, but John G gives you ample opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge. The curves are also quite lenient. Starting it credit\/d and gauging how you do on the first mid-term is the best strategy for this course.",
    "It's good; it's a nice 3 month test to see if you're into finance. Professor Geanakoplos is an interesting man to observe. I'd say go for it.",
    "None of the concepts are really clearly explained during class, so the majority of your time spent on this class is spent on puzzling out the solutions to the poorly-written problem sets, and then hoping some of these show up on the midterms. I would recommend Financial Markets over this course.",
    "The class has been a horrid experience. Aside from getting familiarised with financial jargons and elementary concepts, there is really a dearth of actual financial materials. It's very unhelpful, and it becomes pedagogical at times. The TA's are abysmal with correction and updates on P set answer keys every other day. Apparently, the professor is rich and complains that he needs a secretary.",
    "This class is not for everyone, and certainly not for everyone who thinks they need to take this because they want to go into finance. The material is actually really good if you want to learn about markets, trading, and the kind of work hedge funds do. At times it will seem pretty abstract, partly because of John G's often heavy mathematical exposition in lecture and in the notes, but it actually is very applicable once you get how everything comes together. John G is sometimes not the best lecturer so sitting through lecture was sometimes rough and unrewarding, but as long as you read the notes you'll get a good grasp of the material and the problem sets won't be too bad. Overall would recommend it.",
    "ECON 251 is OK. You will learn how to price mortgages, POs, IOs, bonds, and stocks. Take it for the econ credit.",
    "Only take this class if you want to spend a semester doing boring calculations and deciphering poorly worded questions asking you to do boring calculations. There are no Great Insights to be obtained from the course, and there are better ways of getting a social science credit.",
    "Yes, as long as you have a strong math base and genuine interest in the material, otherwise you will find yourself falling behind as it is a difficult course.",
    "Yes, if they enjoy the subject matter and are willing to trudge through lecture notes.",
    "This course is aggressively subpar. The TA's are absolutely HORRIFIC. I can't tell you how many homeworks, exams, practice problem sets, and answer keys have SEVERE, unforgivable typos that make studying for an already challenging course an absolute nightmare. John G is clearly a highly intelligent trailblazer in theoretical finance, but he presents his concepts in an unnecessarily esoteric fashion. He is pretty much completely overrated as a lecture professor. You'll learn what a call option really is, but I only really recommend taking this course if you got bored of stabbing yourself in the eye witha fork repeatedly.",
    "Yes and no. it looks great on your resume and you do learn certain things but be prepared for a mediocre course, bad lectures and not too interesting material. The class also gets unexpectedly hard at the end, but the curve isn't too brutal.",
    "Super hard class, brace yourselves.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class.",
    "If you are interested in pursuing a career in a fixed income hedge fund this is the course for you.",
    "I would recommend it but definitely as a class that is going to require a lot of work.",
    "Take Financial Theory if you are good at math and want to learn about financial concepts that apply mostly to stocks, bonds, and hedging. Its definitely not easy, but the curve is super generous and its definitely manageable.",
    "Kind of rough at points. We don't use a textbook, so avoid the course if you prefer to learn that way. If you don't, it'll be fine.",
    "Very difficult class, but taught me about major topics in finance (bonds, mortgages, hedging, etc.) that I knew nothing about before. John G is not as good of a lecturer as I had heard, and often goes too quickly, which left me lost and confused much of the time. Psets were very difficult and often forced me to pull all-nighters. Overall though, it's painful but doable. Take if you're an econ major slightly interested in finance.",
    "It's math heavy, and John G isn't the most organized lecturer. But--as someone who enjoys math--I'm glad I took it.",
    "It's an alright course. Do take it seriously though, Math is really easy and the steps to get to the answer are logical so its easy to underestimate the difficulty, which does become apparent once you actually have to do the problems for yourself.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you are okay at math and want to do finance, yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! If you are interested in an introduction to financial products--options, hedging, stock pricing-- it's very helpful. It's also great for learning about mortgages and social security. The areas it mostly leaves out are equity and debt investments, and in the future perhaps it could talk about social investments. But a great class I couldn't recommend any higher.",
    "Great class to take. Introduction to the financial system, and how it works. Pretty problem solving heavy.",
    "I would highly recommend taking it credit\/d\/fail so that you don't have to worry about having a handle on eveything that he tries to teach. I did learn about finance but I think there are better ways to learn the material.",
    "The lectures are terrible, and the professor frequently gets too sidetracked to follow. The posted lecture notes are very good, and the whole course can be learned from these. Make sure you get David for a TA if you're in the class. He's the best TA.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. Even those who love finance or have taken financial markets. The problem sets were very long and very hard and the prof was one of the worst lecturers I've had at Yale. It was an absolutely miserable class. DO NOT TAKE IT.",
    "Yes take this class if you find finance interesting. You will learn a lot about the theoretical backing behind the financial economy.",
    "Good intro not to the entirety of financial markets, but to fundamental financial analysis and modes of thinking. John G is brilliant and a lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Be warned though - it is quite challenging and time consuming. No slacking in this course.",
    "It's a good course but a lot of work and can get challenging. It gets very difficult if you fall behind a little. However, it does start from the basics of finance and does not require intense math.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to anyone looking to learn a little theory behind financial calculations. The class isn't terribly difficult for the most part, although there are definitely certain rough areas. People with strong math backgrounds are definitely going to have an easier time, but your average Yale student can do just fine if you put in the time. Beware though, you need to be very comfortable with algebraic calculations, and not be confused by tons of notation.",
    "yes",
    "absolutely notyou learn nothing really practical or useful about finance, and all of the learning is done through your own efforts in trying to learn the material on your own through his uploaded notes. he's a terrible professor and does not have any ability to teach or convey ideas effectively.",
    "Although finance is not my thing, I enjoyed this class much much more than I expected. The materials are hard, but not impossible if you try. In fact, after the semester ended, I realized they are actually pretty fun and rewarding. The three great things about this course are the professor, and how effectively the course is run. Professor John G. is one of the smartest profs I've had. He's also really fun to listen to, since he has many anecdotal stories to tell. Also, this class is very efficiently run. Psets and exams are graded quickly, lots of review sessions by the professor, lots of office hours by the TAs, well-written class notes that go perfectly with the lectures, lots of practice tests and solutions, etc. Take it and you will be proud after you do.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students with a bent towards rigor and who are willing to put in the work. I would caution you if you have not taken Intermediate Microeconomics (IM) and Financial Markets (FM) - these really should be prerequisites, IM especially.This course provides a systematic introduction to the theory behind the interest rate, diversifying risk, and pricing assets. This course is great if you are looking for a way to really connect everything you have learned in economics. It will bring a fresh new perspective to the theoretical study of finance and it will connect the concepts of IM and FM well.The course is very challenging, and I think anyone who takes it will learn a lot. John G goes pretty quickly, so I think it would be helpful to those who have taken IM and FM as the material in the first and last thirds of financial theory are in some ways applications of these two courses respectively.I want to emphasize to stay upwith the material and be ready to do the work: the class moves quickly, and builds off of itself. Be wary if you take this as a second semester senior, as I myself put off work to my own peril.That said, the curve is nice (although who knows how it will be in future years) and the exams are pretty fair.",
    "Good material, but extremely poorly taught (by far the worst taught and run econ class I've ever taken). Lectures are useless as you are expected to learn the material yourself from the poorly organized and incomplete online notes, and the professor is self-righteous and self-centered. Grading is inconsistent and unfair, and the TAs (except for Noam) were the most apathetic group of graduate students I have ever worked with. They acted as if they had no interest in helping us understand the material. Good luck teaching yourself the material, as that is what you will have to do, assisted only with flat out wrong practice exams and answer keys. Even as a person who doesn't mind 9 am classes and takes econ classes despite not being an econ major, this is a waste of your time, and will probably make you hate yourself and every idiot who is even minorly affiliated with Wall Street.",
    "Highly recommendable",
    "Be careful. I went into this class with an extremely open mind and I had a pretty mediocre experience. The problem sets were tedious BEYOND belief and incredibly, incredibly stressful, even for an Econ major who thought she was used to plowing through tough psets. Lectures are scattered and painful, and I always left having no idea what the professor had just talked about. The plus side is that the exams are really reasonable and draw only from the pset material, so there really aren't any curveballs. And the curve is extremely generous!",
    "Take it if you can handle the math.",
    "I recommend it only to the students who love Economics and Math. It requires much time commitment. To be honest, this class made my semester hard. The problem sets are very hard. It took me much time to prepare for the tests too. However, at the end of this semester, I have to say that I learned a lot from this class, though it had been a hard one.",
    "Interesting course. A decent amount of math but overall I would recommend it and I am not a math person.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student. In summary, it is a mathematical treatment of finance, a unique and interesting course in the economics department.",
    "i went into this class in order to gain some familiarity with basic finance terminology, and i think i more or less accomplished that. some of the ideas in this class are of some mathematical interest, but since this class does not assume that you have any quantitative skills or mathematical intuition, these mathematically interesting ideas are not really investigated. most of the class is centered around a few crucial concepts, so it is really not much information to learn. this is a really really good class to take credit\/D, probably not too easy to get an A in this class.",
    "This is a great course and you'll definitely learn a lot. Everyone talks about the math involved, but you really won't need some crazy rocket science math. You just need to be patient, and try to get TA's help while doing the psets. Although things may seem complicated at first, you'll realize that you'll learn everything while you study for the midterms, and suddenly everything will seem easier- it happened to everyone. As I said, you just need to be patient. Don't give up, pay attention, and you'll succeed! And don't forget that John G. is a very approachable professor.",
    "Financial Theory is a good course in financial economics, though it has the potential to be a lot better. The course begins with a detailed discussion of present value and its importance, a setup of the general equilibrium framework, and an overview of the different types of financial instruments available to transfer funds across time periods. The course then continues to describe finance given uncertainty about the future and how this will affect a financial manager\u0092s decision of how best to invest given the possible states of the world. Overall, the class is more mathematical than descriptive. The mathematics level required is high school algebra and a little bit of calculus and homework assignments emphasize mathematics more frequently than many students would have liked. Homework assignments for the class are often like puzzles and vary in terms of difficulty and length drastically. Exams (two midterms, one final) are fair, but lengthy, and are graded and returned quickly. In terms of teaching, John Geanakoplos is an excellent teacher at the beginning of the term and is able to keep everyone\u0092s attention. However, toward the middle of the semester, his teaching became disorganized before he ended the semester with an excellent lecture or two. The teaching fellows for spring 2012 were absolutely incompetent and\/or lazy. Given the quantity of teaching fellows and their limited responsibilities, there is no reason why wrong answers to homework assignments should have been posted and revised consistently, but not always correctly. Overall, I would recommend this class to any Yale student interested in finance. John Geanakoplos says the first class that you can take this class with no background in economics. While this is definitely possible, I do suggest taking at a minimum introductory microeconomics, if not intermediate, to understand the first 10%-20% of the class, though figuring out this material is anything but impossible. For the remaining 80%-90%, absolutely no background in economics is required.",
    "Generally good overview of financial theory. Not necessarily a course on how markets work - much more focus on the math of things. Lectures\/ information is hard to follow - I recommend reading lecture notes and doing lots of practice problems.Hard concepts to follow the first time around.",
    "I would recommend Econ 251 to anyone interested in finance or the financial system.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in finance and\/or mathematical economics. It is a very interesting, challenging, and insightful course.",
    "You learn a lot of the math behind what people do in finance (i.e. you don't actually calculate present values by hand on Wall Street, but it's good to know how and why a computer is doing so). This is intellectually rigorous and pushes you, so take it if you like math or finance in an intellectual and academic sense. Don't take it if you expect it to help you in interviews. I took this as a senior AFTER doing internships on Wall Street, and can say that maybe 5% of the class could have possibly come in handy in interviews, and possibly barely at that.",
    "Great course if you're interested in finance. Not too hard mathematically but it can get complicated. You will need to spend some time to tangle out the material, but otherwise its not so bad. Solutions to problem sets and exams are horribly written and sometimes just flat out wrong and misleading.",
    "If you're interested in econ, math, or problem solving, I would definitely recommend this class. The class is not easy, but you learn a lot in the course throughout the semester. This class gives you new perspective on some real-world problems (mortgage crisis, socialsecurity) too.",
    "A good introduction to financial instruments and important related concepts. Lectures are not particularly enjoyable and often confuse you, and you often need to resort to the notes (which sometimes are also complicated and hard to understand) and the online course(maybe better taught). This is a huge class and the curve is in general fine. Problem sets and exams are okay, but you still need to study hard. TAs are very responsible so remember to make good use of them."
