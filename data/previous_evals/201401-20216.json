    "Great course if you want to practice your creative writing and need some peer input.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class. Marc gives helpful feedback and you get to hear what others think about your script. Plus, since you're given a clear deadline, it's extra motivation to write. If you're interested in screenwriting, then why not?",
    "Intermediate is very similar to Intro, except that there are fewer people in the class, so each person gets more attention on their script during the workshopping phase. I would recommend this to any film studies major, whether you're really into screenwriting or not, if just to work with Marc for another semester.",
    "I would say definitely take it, knowing that at times you will be frustrated that you are listening to a professor talk much of the time instead of creating something. It's really difficult to get into the class so make sure you can make a case for why you want to be in it. It's so cool that you come out of the class having written a 25-30 page (so a 25-30 minute) screenplay. That being said you wont write it til the very end of the semester usually so the stuff leading up to then is really just discussions of movies and doing some script coverage. It's incredible to see what you can write and hear Marc's feedback on your writing. Marc may seem like an eccentric dude but his feedback is really invaluable. Don't let the one minute filming of your screenplay scare you. You don't actually need to know much about camera's or editing or anything like that. Just enlist the help of someone else in your class who does. The one minute video doesn't need to be good.",
    "If you liked Intro. it's more of the same but better. Longer screenplay, more workshopping."
