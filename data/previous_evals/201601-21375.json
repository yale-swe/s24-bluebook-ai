    "I would recommend it to students who are interested in pursuing a career or further study in film, but not as someone who is just dabbling.",
    "Don't take it for fun. Take it if you have to, it's not a \"fun\" course, but it's also a manageable and informative course as a requirement.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for an easy film class because they enjoy going to the movie theater. That being said, for people looking to go deep into ways of looking at film (or if you want to be a film major - then you don't have a choice), this class does exactly that. FILM 320 really helped me figure out ways to examine film that I wasn't used to before. The screening list for this semester was very eclectic and interesting and I definitely got a chance to see some weird and cool movies that I probably would not have otherwise.",
    "A collection of screenings and writing responses intended to deepen one's ability to analyze films from a broad array of genres and topics."
