    "I would definitely recommend this course! This is a very different experience, and may inspire you to take on the Camino de Santiago yourself! Provides a good introduction to myriad topics inSpanish history, and you will be able to chat about Santiago himself nonstop. One of the highlights of my semester.",
    "YES! This is class is very engaging and fun to be in. It is a great way to immerse yourself in another language with a great professor. It really exposes you to a different culture and side of the world. I do not regret taking this class at all and am very thankful to have taken this class.",
    "Take this class. The workload is manageable, the readings are interesting, the professor funny, and the class lectures worthwhile. Put in the work, and you'll enjoy the class.",
    "Spanish 368 is that class that you look forward to all day, and when you leave you leave with a smile on your face. Definitely take this course!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. It is excellent!",
    "This is an awesome class. Class pretty much consists of Kevin talking about some aspect of the Camino for 75 minutes, but it's always really interesting. And at any time, you can feel free to interject with a question or a related point--or unrelated for that matter...Kevin loved those. It's just a really relaxed environment. I ALWAYS looked forward to class. So much fun.There was a reading (sometimes pretty substantial) for every class that we would discuss, but they were usually manageable. The only other work was 3 essays spread out across the semester that were kind of fun to write. And Kevin took us to the Cloisters and the Met to look at art concerning Santiago Peregrino. So great.",
    "Yes. wholeheartedly. Not too much work, and fabulous material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. TAKE IT! Great way to fulfill your Language credit or to simply learn something interesting from an awesome professor!",
    "This is one of the best classes you will ever take at Yale! Or probably just anything with Prof. Poole as he makes class enjoyable, fun, and funny and yet at the same time you learn so much. It seems impossible that you can enjoy something this much and yet get so much out of it knowledge-wise but you do! I chose this class because the language level of other Spanish classes seemed too low and the professors not as interesting. I knew nothing about El Camino until coming to class, however I was instantly hooked and now I feel I am an expert on a subject I previously knew nothing about. It is not just about the Camino; the class combines history, culture, art, literature, and language in a way that is beautiful and exhilarating especially is you are already a fan of Spanish culture. Take this class! Prof. Poole is amazing, the class is chill and not too demanding. You will have a great time and yet learn so much!",
    "This class is a joy; the professor is fantastic, and the readings are quite interesting. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great course if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a L5 Spanish class that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like a language course, just a relaxed history class that happens to be taught in Spanish."
