    "This is a reading based seminar where we critically analyze texts on the history of human-environment interactions in Africa in the context of local cultures and colonialism. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in human-enviornment interactions outside a Western context.",
    "It is more than the environmental history of Africa. It is a class that uses the environmental both literally and metaphorically to deconstruct a history of a region that is often misrepresented in academia. Yes, I'd recommend it to anyone interested in a general history of the context. I'd recommend it to anyone going into international policy as it provides the tools to understanding global politics in the aftermath of imperialism."
