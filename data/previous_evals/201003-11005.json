    "Absolutely...great for anyone interested in the novel.",
    "I would highly recommend ENG 831 01 to anyone interested in discovering a new way to examine and write about widely read Victorian novels. Dr. Yeazell is an excellent guide.",
    "The course provided an \"introduction\" to the nineteenth-century novel - a sampling of major authors and (mostly) major works - through the lens of two critical methods that have (re-)emerged in the last fifteen years. As such, the course was both wide-ranging and very focused - an excellent balance. Anyone interested in the development of the novel, the development of \"realism,\" the study of character, or the study of nineteenth century culture would benefit from this course.",
    "I would recommend this course highly to anyone wishing to gain either an overview or a specialized insight into nineteenth century literature: this course was suited both to the newcomer and the well-established scholar."

   "comments": [
    "Precisely in my field. Really helped me in terms of understanding the current critical conversation.",
    "The course gave me a sense of the current state of scholarship in characterization and the study of nineteenth century culture. I can foresee much of the criticism - including both more formalist approaches to characterization and more historicist approaches to material culture - contributing to my research on literary style and its relationship with developing communication technologies. The novels have also provided needed context for my work on the developments of literary modernism.",
    "This course allowed me to write on a subject that I had been interested in for years, and for that I was very grateful."
