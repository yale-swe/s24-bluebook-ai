    "The Study of the City is quite an experience--I learned a great deal, but it was a frustrating class at times. Professor Garvin doesn't really give direct instruction or do much teaching; he likes students to learn by doing, which can be frustrating when thrown into a totally new field like this. Still, it was a really rewarding semester and I am impressed, as I look back, at how much I learned in such a short time. In some ways it feels more like an internship than a class, in that you're trying out an experience (planning) rather than just learning about how to do it from a book. That part is really valuable.",
    "Excellent course, opportunity to learn valuable, professional skills, and hands-on. Challenging, yes, but well worth it.",
    "I would, but only after telling them what they are getting into. The class was a lot of late nights and headaches, but ultimately rewarding.",
    "The class is one that you may find disarming, illogical, annoying, all sorts of things. But at the end of the day, if you approach it with a great attitude, and if you actually do the reading, you will take away a lot. I would make sure that if you sign on to take the class, you be prepared to spend a good bit of time reading. For the sake of future excited students, I hope that anyone who reads this and doesn't think they are going to read the material not take the class. You will be dead weight. Another thing to know about this class is that it has a long heritage. Garvin has been teaching this stuff since the 1960s. That makes this class very unique; though few recall the name at the present, this class was famous in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. The alumni of the class have gone on to do very important, spectacular things in government, real estate development, housing finance, non-profit, et cetera. You may find Garvin eccentric or even frustrating, but the guy is incredibly smart who really knows his stuff. And again, if you approach this class with a degree of seriousness, you seriously will learn a ton of stuff that all yale kids should know, but don't.",
    "This class is one of the most unusual, exciting, engaging, classes I've ever taken. You'll sit in a room of fifteen or so students and hash out a plan for part of New Haven, using everything you learn in the first half of the class and all the guidance Professor Garvin and the rest of the class gives you in the second half. There's something so exciting about working on the homework when it is a genuine idea for part of the city you live in. And not only that, it's a proposal you'll present to some of the people who could implement the plan if they liked it enough. People like the VP of New Haven affairs of Yale. You'll play games that will make you work harder than any paper you've ever written but will be exhilarating and will teach you about urban policy, real estate, and leadership. It was the best way I could imagine spending my semester. Take it........ (if you have questions about the class you can email me at brendan.hellweg@yale.edu)",
    "This class is not worth it - even if you are interested in cities and urbanism (as I am). This came as a huge dissapointment to me (especially because there was so much interest in the class on the first day). Professor Garvin is not a good instructor; I found him to be patronizing on one occasion, self-absorbed and self-aggrandizing, and rather disorganized. During group presentations, he would often spend 30 minutes on one group and 5 on the next, making for an unfair structure to the class. Also, there are no grades or assessments throughout the class, so it is impossible to know how one is doing. And while there are some interesting exercises, I don't think I learned much of anything throughout the semester. In spite of the overwhelmingly negative reviews I read for this class, I took it in hopes that my passion for cities would get me something out of it. Don't make the same mistake.",
    "This course is one a kind. Over my two semesters at Yale, Study of the City has challenged in a way that I had not been challenged before: taking ideas and putting them to practice in the real world. Alexander Garvin's teaching style which involves uses games as instruction were a well needed change of pace from the usual Yale course load. If you want real world application, group work, and problem solving that may keep you up until ungodly hours, this is the course for you. This is the opposite of an effortless course, and that's what makes it worthwhile."
