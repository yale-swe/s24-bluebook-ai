    "Great class. Lots of good reading and class discussion.",
    "This class is about the underlying philosophical issues for bioethics, including identity and the definition of death. If you want a more practical perspective I would recommend Latham's lecture over this seminar, but this seminar was definitely well worth taking. Very fascinating, David Smith was incredible (unfortunately, this was his last year at Yale).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Other bioethics classes at Yale are all general overviews of multiple topics. In this class, you can really go in depth into end of life and neurological issues. You also have the option to explore any topic that interests you in further depth for the final paper.",
    "a very interesting seminar on a small range of bioethics issues. by focusing on fewer issues, you can examine them more in depth. 5 short 2 pg papers, 1 long paper (max 15 pages), and a short presentation, as well as participation each class. the setup of the class is great, and so is professor smith! Definitely take it if you like the topic, but sadly, Professor Smith won't be teaching next year.",
    "This is a great seminar with a wonderful professor. There is a moderate amount of reading for every class. Every other week you have to write a two-page, double spaced reflection on the readings. Professor Smith does a pretty good job of facilitating discussions. Overall, I definitely recommend the course!",
    "Absolutely! Especially if you're interested in bioethics and philosophy.",
    "This was a fantastic class, and it's a shame that it won't be taught by Professor Smith anymore. The readings were accessible and thought-provoking, and the short 1-2 page reading response every other week was totally manageable. The class covered a wide range of material so it was sort of a nice survey of issues in biomedical issues. Even if you don't end up taking the class, the readings are worth checking out.",
    "This is a very good seminar, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in questions of end-of-life issues or who just wants to generally learn more about bioethics as a field. Discussions range widely from religion to personal identity to dementia care, and are consistently interesting and helpful. The class involves reading responses every other week that we discuss in seminar, and so it is also a great opportunity to learn about numerous different cases and applications of the principles you consider from your classmates.",
    "PLSC 319 is an excellent course that I would definitely recommend to other students. I do believe that Professor Smith played an integral role in defining and developing this course, however, his successor will be left with an excellent syllabus and a community of students from diverse majors who will be interested in such important issues to debate and discuss.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to everyone, but I don't think Prof. Smith is teaching it again unfortunately!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This is what Yale classes should be like; we learned more than just the subject matter at hand, as we were encouraged to develop tools such as more rigorous thinking and learned how to more convincingly develop arguments, but also had many of our beliefs challenged and had to think deeply about the kinds of values we want to embrace, and the kind of lives we want to lead."
