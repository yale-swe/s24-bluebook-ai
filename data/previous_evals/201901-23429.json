    "Generally, I learned about the many tracks of research that are currently in place regarding neural nets. One particular skill I gained was from the first couple lectures, whose focus on approximation theory helped me figure out how to state a theorem for my research.",
    "I learned more about neural nets and the techniques used to analyze them",
    "I learned a lot about the theory behind neural networks and how such topics are approached from the statistical side (vs the implementation side taught in other boring courses)",
    "This was way too hard for me, so not much",
    "Review of recent papers reporting theoretical developments in deep learning",
    "General overview of various topics related to neural nets",
    "Reading papers",
    "I've learned a lot about the current research being done with regards to neural nets. For me, taking this course helped me understand how people approach research in academia and helped me gain more experience working on theoretical material.",
    "Very detailed introduction to the state of art theoretical neural nets research",
    "Good"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are that it covers very fresh research and familiarizes the students with it.",
    "Good variety of papers presented, lectures interesting, workload was appropriate. Maybe having a tiny bit more work, e.g. a response required after each lecture, would be good encouragement to stay engaged throughout the whole lecture.",
    "Some of the papers were a little tough and maybe you could provide additional notes to get people up to speed prior to the lectures",
    "Nice professor, but the papers discussed need to be explained at a higher level before delving into the proof.",
    "This course just reviews papers. Its exactly what is advertised.",
    "Great lecturer. Could have more in terms of student engagement with assignments or in class participation to encourage deeper learning.",
    "I think this course was great!",
    "Strength: Very good selection of papers. Weakness: The pace could be faster.",
    "Good"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, as long as the student is comfortable with machine learning, probability, and linear algebra.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was like having an almost-personalized research talk given each week, carefully curated to build your understanding of a particular topic. And of course, Harry is a wonderful professor.",
    "Yes, it was very helpful as an overview to neural network theory and should be taken by anyone who wants to work in this field",
    "Only take this course if you really are interested in graduate level statistics work, otherwise the papers are very theoretical and the concepts are hard to grasp.",
    "You will only get something out of this course if you are genuinely interested in cutting edge deep learning research. Otherwise its not worth it.",
    "yes",
    "Yes.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I would definitely recommend it. I would recommend any class taught by Harry.",
    "Yes. Mostly because the topic is very popular.",
