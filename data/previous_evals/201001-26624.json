    "I thought that this course was structured very well with a set of topics that were varied and provided differentstories and developments into the much concealed global networks that are overlaid on our everyday lives. I thought that the readings were very effective and long certain weeks but not too much information in total. I though that the structure in preparing for the final paper was effective from the initial submission to petcha kucha and final development.",
    "I would have appreciated more in-depth or technical discussions in the lectures about the larger topics.",
    "The course explored globalization through a myriad of issues and characters around the world. Whilst a connection to architecture was often made, it was more often that architecture was a resultant of certain global processes or transactions. As such, the course has very little to do with architecture, per say, and everything to do with contemporary spaces in the city which are the products of globalization aka not designed by architects."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations were to explore the layers of globalization and discover new writers and practitioners in this field of investigation. I was introduced to many writers but I think that a more frequent tie to practitioners and current work that addresses this capacity would help drive many of the concepts further.",
    "See question 4. How they were met: some of the content seems mired in late 90s technological prowess, and has a hard time feeling relevant today. Kevin Kelly appears to be always waiting in the wings.Also, I wonder if there is room in the course for those who embrace globalization in order to undermine it. Pirates come to mind...But I wonder about young architecture practices and their facility in the globalized market; how they are making opportunities for themselves."

    "it was a great course thoght by a very accomplished instructor. Very interesting and fun material was shown.",
    "I felt this course was valuable in many ways from the expertise that Keller brings as an instructor to the opportunity to think and develop a project in this vein.",
    "I really enjoyed the input from the business school students. As an architecture student, I felt like I already knew the things the other architects had to say. If this is at all possible, I would encourage more students from different schools to join the class.",

    "very high. as an mba the course provided new insight on and opportunity to consider SOM core material."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very well run and effective in my opinion. I do think that Keller could encourage and push the discussion section further. At times the discussion went way off track or was slow in producing a dialogue and possibly more visual or question structured preparation by the students would take this further.",
    "Nathan was fine, although most of my interaction was with Keller. Seemed as though the graduate students got a great treat."

   "comments": [
    "I very much enjoyed the course!",
    "As a broad survey for undergraduates, the course succeeds completely. But often the leftist down-on-globalization slander got in the way of more specific issues. I liked the content of the course, as well as its implications. But it also felt very easy to demonize globalization, where in many cases the new interconnectedness of the world has improved certain socio-economic conditions for once struggling nations, as well as our own.
