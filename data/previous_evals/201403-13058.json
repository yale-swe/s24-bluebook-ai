   "comments": [
    "Definitely! A great background and information source for the economics of healthcare. Given the scope of healthcare today and in the future, a basic understanding of the system will be crucial for anyone working in health, finance, government and consulting.",
    "Good course to learn valuable information about the HC industry",
    "One of the most informative classes taken at Yale. This will almost certainly be my lowest grade this semester, but I don't regret taking it. Especially as a senior who will have to deal with health insurance and health care directly next year, it was a great way to better understand the system. However, if the topic doesn't sound interesting to you, this course will not make up for that",
    "Overall ECON 170 is a good class. At the beginning of the semester Professor Forman said we would come away from the semester knowing more about the healthcare system than almost anyone in America. I'm not sure what the benchmark is for knowledge about the healthcare system, but I definitely feel I have a pretty complete understanding of it after a semester in this class. Lectures can be boring at times, but I think that's true of all Econ lectures. The workload was very manageable - 3 short assignments, a paper a midterm and a final. Readings were optional but the homeworks were graded pretty hard. All in all, if this subject interests you, you should take this class! You'll learn a lot if you pay attention.",
    "A great econ elective. Really fascinating material that is well presented and well taught. Would take it again in a heartbeat. Also, not the toughest course in the world.",
    "Yes. Understanding the current healthcare system is something everyone should know.",
    "Great econ class that gives you a pretty comprehensive overview of the U.S. healthcare system, particularly ACA and its implications moving forward. Lots of guest lecturers which made the class more current and interesting too. A couple of very short psets at the start of semester, 1 midterm, 1 final that focused much more on understanding concepts rather than fact memorization which made the class very fun and the workload manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I learned a lot about the US healthcare system and Professor Forman made sometimes very dry lecture material interesting, engaging, and humorous!",
    "The affordable care act",
    "Yea I probably wouldn't recommend this class. You can learn the same material by reading headlines about healthcare and most of the information you learn isn't useful for real-life healthcare discussions. The lectures were ok, but the grading was arbitrary and unfair.",
    "Great econ class!! You learn a lot of super relevant and interesting stuff. Take it.",
    "If you have any interest in how the healthcare system works (everyone should), you should absolutely take this course. Forman is an incredible asset to the community, and his presentation of the material was always engaging. He is super approachable, and if you ever get a chance, try to meet with him in person - he is kind, helpful, and hilarious. Some of the material was a bit dry and technical, but the guest lectures were always interesting.",
    "As someone who took this class Credit\/D, I think it was a great class if you just want a basic understanding of the health care system in the US. Credit\/D is a good choice if you're not truly invested in going into health care\/have a real passion for it, because overall there is a lot of information presented and the midterm and final exam expect a lot of knowledge. The workload is fairly light, though grading is not particularly easy.",
    "This is a good class if you are interested in healthcare. It has little to no econ involved so you should not be worried about that. It basically requires you to memorize a lot of information and to really understand healthcare finance topics. I don't think this is the best econ elective, but it's not too difficult and definitely worth it if you are going into the healthcare industry.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is interesting and you learn a lot in the class.",
    "This class is primarily a policy class, not an econ course. It does make you way more informed on relevant topics like the Affordable Care Act; however, be aware that the course doesn't cover a lot of econ.",
    "It's a very good class for anyone who wants to know more about US health system and the health economics. You will know it very well at the end of this semester and this class is very fun and enjoyable.",
    "Good overview of health Econ, careful of the final though.",
    "YES",
    "A good introduction into the basics of healthcare policy. I would recommend ECON 170 to econ majors looking for an easier, less quantitative elective and I would recommend ECON 170 as a low-key fifth class to anyone who is interested in health policy. The material is interesting, although during the semester does not seem like it. But when I look back, I felt like I learned a lot this semester.",
    "Econ 170 is an amazing course for anyone who wants to know how the U.S. healthcare system really works. It is a course that every Yale student should take before graduating, to understand the details and challenges that the healthcare system is facing, as well as one's options regarding health insurance upon graduation.",
    "A surprisingly comprehensive and in-depth introduction to all the different components of the health care industry; you'll definitely be ready for any health care consulting internship after this course. It's more of a \"layman's\" economics, by which I mean there are no formulas or theories (I believe there's an senior econ seminar dedicated to the actual economics of health, if that's what you're looking for); while this of course makes it accessible to students of all backgrounds (half of the class were pre-meds), be aware: it's not your grandma's econ lecture. Workload is pretty low; the midterms are extremely... detail-oriented, so be on the lookout for that. The final paper is a pain, so if you want to stop it from extending into your reading period, find some way to get started on it as early as possible.",
    "Absolutely take it - while you probably won't go to every class, the classes you will go to are interesting. You learn a ton about the various facets of health care from the various provisions of the ACA to how med school graduates are matched to residencies. One of the most practical classes I've taken here. Two short homework assignments, a midterm, final, and final paper.",
    "The class teaches about the pros and cons of the healthcare system. It's an awesome elective for the Econ major, but it's really an interesting course for anyone to take.",
    "Yes. The subject might seem dull, but the course turned out to be fascinating and fun. Forman's lectures are very good, and he brings in a number of guest lecturers with real experience in the field. Assignments and tests are fair and expectations are transparent. I enjoyed this class much more than I expected to.",
    "A pretty poor class, unfortunately. While Professor Howard Forman, MD-MBA is undoubtedly a talented man, his lecturing abilities have a great deal of room for improvement. He comes up with the occasional funny comment but in general his voice remains at a low monotone. He may be an accomplished doctor but he doesn't have a graphic design bone in his body - the 40+ slide Powerpoint lectures are mostly black Arial text on a while background. A half-hour or so into lecture, the slides begin to blur into each other... one after another... snore. The content of the class is also misleading. I'd say 90% of the class were either econ majors or pre-meds, but the course itself was 90% public policy. Really should be listed as PLSC and not ECON.",
    "interesting subject matter, but the material is often confusing and unclear. Forman is well intentioned and very knowledgeable, but not easy to understand sometimes and the class is hard to follow sometimes. If you don't like healthcare, it may not be interesting enough to pay attention and do well.",
    "You will learn a lot",
    "This class is a very good overview of the entire healthcare industry with a focus on health insurance and current US healthcare policy. Very interesting guest lectures are spread throughout the semester to break up the classic lecture format. Great class, would highly recommend.",
    "Take it to find out more about the US healthcare system. It's not too difficult. Eye-opening material.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It was a comprehensive overview of the healthcare system. It's not too difficult, and I've enjoyed attending class. The guest lectures are interesting too and now I can say that I know a lot about our healthcare system!",
    "More of a poli-sci than Econ class. Howie is very knowledgeable in the area and great, but lectures can get pretty dull sometimes. TA's are unresponsive and some are incompetent\/unhelpful. Overall not too much work, but not a terribly exciting way to fulfill an Econ credit.",
    "Econ 170 was a pretty interesting class. the workload was not too bad. The class was at times a bit dull, but Forman is a great professor. I recommend the class. The workload is very manageable and the material is highly relevant\/ interesting.",
    "Very US focused, you learn a lot about the intricacies of Medicare\/Medicaid and the US health care system. Lectures are boring.",
    "Good class covering interesting material. Excellent if you care at all about the nation's health system, its structure, and its financing. Easy workloadbut if you want to do well and actually come to any mastery of the material, you will need to do a lot of work on your own outside of class. The lectures and readings are a bit disorganized. There's a lot of jumping from point to point without a lot of explanation. You also have no major grades except for a final paper, a midterm, and a finalmeaning that you will end the term not really having any idea what your final grade will be. There is no guidance or feedback whatsoever provided on the final paperyou basically write about whatever you want (relating to the course material or not) and then someone grades it. The powerpoints are also exceptionally unhelpfulyou will have to attend every lecture and take good notes if you want to come to a good understanding of what's being taught.",
    "I thought that this was a pretty interesting class. I feel like I have a better understanding of the health care system, and it wasn't too much work. I'd say it was definitely worth taking, especially if you're an econ major.",
    "Wow, take this course. I think this class may be the best lecture class I've taken at Yale; it was definitely a lot better than I expected. The material is really important (now you can finally know what you're talking about when you argue with someone over healthcare, yay) and it is presented in a way that's accessible. Also, Howie Forman is really funny and makes lecture fun. Workload would have been on the lighter side, with only 2 homeworks and 2 exams, but we were also required to write a paper about health care citing 8 scholarly sources...I definitely didn't feel like I was qualified to write about this. This was a small drawback to a really strong course though.",
    "Kinda dry. Credit D."
