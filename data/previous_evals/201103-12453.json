    "Accounting the subject is useful. Accounting the class at Yale isn't enough to teach you what you need to know. Get a textbook instead and take a class that will actually be enjoyable.",
    "Depends. If you are planning on pursuing a financial career, yes.",
    "take it if you are interested in accounting or going into finance or business. it's very boring but a pretty easy class.",
    "I don't recommend this course.",
    "This is a great course to learn financial accounting, which will be important no matter what you do in the future. The material is a little dry, but with a little persistence, it's well worth it.",
    "Accounting is useful for any profession. Take it although you'll learn everything from the book.",
    "this class is very dry, no need to go to lecture, you can learn everything from the textbook so dont take it unless you want to put it on your resume or you REALLY love accounting. but otherwise its not too difficult, very good for credit\/d",
    "Only take it cr\/d",
    "I cannot stress this enough: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.This was tied for the WORST class I have taken at Yale. I took this class because it good good reviews, I thought I would learn something practical, and the professor seemed personable in the first lecture. It gradually turned into a nightmare.1) The professor initially said attendance would account for 15% of our final grade. After a few weeks he arbitrarily decided that instead he'd just put that 15% into the final test.2) Lectures are beyond useless, and actually counterproductive. The professor merely gives a poorly-worded, confusing, and at times mistaken, recount of the textbook - the chapter that everyone was already required to read thoroughly in order to complete the last week's problem set. I have never felt like such a chump for attending lectures before.3) The midterm was filled with questions that were not relevant to the material covered in the beginning of the course. In fact, some of the questions referred to accounting terminology not found in the textbook. Maybe this is good for people who have taken accounting in high school, but for everyone else it's just unfair. The Professor actually started the exam by saying \"i know we have not studied write-offs yet, but uh... it's to do with amortization...do your best.\" I mean, why were we tested on material that we hadn't studied yet? At this point I had been attending lecture, so can verify that there were no clues that this material might be at all relevant. It also took over 2 months to grade the midterm, so nobody knew whether to switch out of credit\/D.4) The Professor and TA's were often unresponsive or unhelpful, so there was nobody to ask for help if you wanted it.5) For the final exam, the professor gave out a package of 4 or 5 final exams from past years to study from - all extended written long-answer questions. After studying these questions thoroughly and preparing for a similarly structured test, in the end our final exam was COMPLETELY multiple choice. ALSO, these questions contained material not discussed in class, nor covered in the text book. There were technical terms and concepts that nobody had any reason to know. I feel like the course material was so straightforward the only way to institute a curve is to randomly throw in impossible questions that students will be forced to guess at with a 1\/4 chance. ALSO the test had terrible directions.Don't take it. If you are looking for practical skills in accounting - take a webinar, skim a few powerpoints on the internet, or just learn on the job. Don't subject yourself to this. If you took this class credit\/D it might be ok, as you could probably invest very little time and effort and scrape out a B-. But I think even then, there are too many other courses to choose from at Yale that are equal in workload and about 1000x more pleasant.",
    "If you need to know accounting, you need to know accounting. Schiffres is a nice guy.",
    "The material was practical and interesting--exactly why I took the course. I know I learned a lot. Unfortunately, I had to learn everything on my own. We have a pset due every morning of class. And the material on the pset would be covered in that very lecture. So I would have already read the chapter, only to attend lecture to hear it again. That may be one reason so few students show up to class. (Excluding the fact that the course is at 9AM.) The midterm and final were both open book, but I found them both very difficult. When we received the midterm, the professor said: There are some questions covering material you guys haven't learned yet. Just... think outside of the box.",
    "Do not take this class. This is the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Decent but you could get just as much out of reading the textbook",
    "NO, it's a terrible class with a terrible teacher",
    "The final exam of this class is all multiple choice questions. At least five of them are neither covered by the textbook nor the lectures. Lectures are about the material that you have done problem set on the night before. If you want to learn accounting, do it on your own.",
    "I emphatically urge you not to take this class. I am not being hyperbolic when I say that it is not only the worst class I have taken at Yale, it is also a complete waste of your time and your parents' money. Professor Schiffres is the worst professor at Yale, and it is actually unacceptable that he is allowed to teach at an institution of Yale's standing. This class was so bad that many students are mobilizing to try to have Professor Schiffres fired. At the end of the semester, I felt so strongly that I wrote a letter of complaint to my dean, urging the University to take action against Professor Schiffres. Below are my list of complaints.1. The professor made no attempt at all to teach the material. During his lectures, the professor simply read from a PowerPoint presentation that gave an incomplete summary of theassigned chapter from the textbook. Because we had already read the chapter before class, and because the book explained the material in a more comprehensive, thorough, and understandable manner, the professor\u0092s lectures added no value to the class whatsoever.2. The professor did not write the midterm exam but rather gave us an MIT exam available online. As a result, the exam was not tailored to his course or the material we had covered by that point in the semester. Before the exam began, the professor warned us that there was a significant amount of material on the exam that we had not yet covered, but he claimed that he had put this material on the midterm in order to \u0093challenge\u0094 us. Although I and the rest of the class thought it was unfair to test us on material which we had not yet covered, our outrage grew after the exam when we realized that this material was not consciously included on the exam to \u0093challenge\u0094 us, but rather was on the exam because our professor was too lazy to write his own test.3. The professor did not hand book our midterms until five weeks after the midterm exam date. Students taking the class Credit\/D\/Fail were forced to decide whether or not to convert the class to a letter grade without knowing how well they had done on their midterm exam. The implications on Credit\/D\/Fail students aside, waiting five weeks to hand back midterms is disrespectful to students and indicative of the professor\u0092s thought (or lack thereof) for his students and effort (or lack thereof) devoted to his class.4. The professor clearly did not write the final exam (which accounted for 50% of our final grade), as it included several questions relating to material that was not even covered in the book or the lectures. This is not hyperbolic. Several topics tested on the final exam were not mentioned at all in the textbook. How can a professor test his students on material that was not covered by any source provided by the course? Furthermore, the exam, which was multiple choice, contained several questions so ambiguously worded that they were practically indecipherable. The correct answer to several questions depended on important details that were not included in the question, with different answer choices that could be correct depending on these omitted details. Other questions, we were told about 3\/4 of the way through the exam, had multiple correct answers, and to get full credit for the question, you had to include all of the correct answer choices. However, this peculiarity was not mentioned in the question or in the instructions. To make matters worse, our professor instructed our TAs not to answer any question we had, even if it simply involved clarification of the issues mentioned above. Midway through the exam, many students were laughing out loud, unable to contain their outrage caused by the absurdity of the exam.5. The professor\u0092s general attitude towards his students was extremely condescending. It has been the first class I have taken at Yale in which I did not feel like the professor cared about or respected his students whatsoever.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "The course was very practical and useful. The professor was not. He cannot expect people to sit in his class for over an hour if you don't learn and don't have enough incentive to do so. I understand this is not the most exciting subject to learn or teach, but the professor seemed disorganized and uncommitted to making the experience worthwhile. Overall, I would NOT recommend the course because you can learn this material any time and any where so take a different course where people care or you can get a good grade. Don't waste your time like I apparently did.",
    "Take it if you are interested in finance because it is really essential to understand accounting to do anything in finance. It's not too much work, and easy to learn from the book. If you don't udnerstand something you can go to lecture and hear him explain it again, and then ask questions. If you are taking it to learn something (which is the only reason you should take this class- not enjoyable just for the sake of it) I would take it for a grade, because if you take it Cr\/D you will just let a lot slide and not learn anything, because the exams are open book",
    "You're going to take this class regardless of what the recommendation says, right? It's useful; you should take it if you think it is worth knowing. The professor really isn't bad like everyone says; he just lectures right out of the book that you've already read the chapter on, so it's really hard to get up for 9 am class.",
    "Only take this course if you are genuinely interested in accounting or need accounting skills for your desired profession. Otherwise, it can be quite dry and uninteresting.",
    "I'd recommend it for independent workers who want an introduction to accounting.",
    "This is the worst course I have ever taken at Yale.Please do not be fooled into thinking this course is a good idea. Do you want to go into finance\/consulting\/business\/anything that uses financial statements? It doesn't matter - this class will not help you.The professor doesn't teach. He just reads off of slides given to him by the textbook company. So you'll just sleep in and read the book rather than waste your time going to this awful 9am class.The professor gave the two worst exams I have ever taken. Most of the material had nothing to do with the curriculum. That's not that surprising given that we found a copy of the midterm on another university's opencourse website when we were reviewing solutions.Oh, and we couldn't review solutions until 5 weeks after we took the midterm because it took him nearly half of the length of the course to hand them back.I didn't learn anything. This was a total waste of my time.",
    "Sure, if you need it for something.",
    "Absolutely not. You are better off reading the textbook on your own.",
    "You may take this class if you find it extremely boring to read the textbook.",
    "Useful, but be prepared to self study a lot. Go ahead and take it senior year.",
    "Yale very much needs more classes like this one. However, if they're going to be taught as poorly as this one was, then no one should take them. If you are going to take it, take it Credit\/D.",
    "Boring lecture, useful info, could be learned on your own.",
    "take it if you really have to, but dont expect to be graded fairly.",
    "The nebulous status of the discipline of accounting at Yale must be addressed as soon as possible. I understand the rationale behind not granting credit towards the economics major to students enrolled in accounting, and I appreciate that Yale would rather its students not spend their academic careers on preprofessional pursuits. Yale's clear bias against accounting, however, is reflected in the quality of the class. The course was unstimulating, unengaging, and, quite simply, a waste of my time at Yale. In no other class have I felt that I was simply logging time and effort for credit. Unfortunately, the class is also useful; after having worked in the financial sector, I saw clearly how the material that I was learning would help me in the initial stages of my future career. Take the course if you want or if you must, but do not hold your expectations high.",
    "This would especially appeal to anyone who hopes to read financial statements or news intelligently.",
    "Terrible.",
    "This class will help students analyse and create the four basic financial statements. Additionally, learning accounting principles allows students to gain a deeper understanding of various indicators of an individual business's financial situation. The midtermis fairly straightforward and the homework is not very time intensive. In my year the final exam was a bit odd, in that it was a 50 question multiple choice exam with a focus on international standards and obscure principles, but previous years' final exams seemed fairly standard."
