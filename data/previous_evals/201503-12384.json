   "comments": [
    "A lot of good material (for those who studied extensively for competitions in high school the material is largely that because of the focus on Combinatorics and Graph Theory). Ferber is great. Only criticism is a lack of notes but given it was his first year teaching this course I'm confident he could put something good together.",
    "Phenomenal class. Half combinatorics, half graph theory. I'd recommend this class to anyone interested in proof-based math who wants a fun, reasonably gentle introduction. Also interesting for those who already have some experience with proofs. If Asaf is teaching this class again, you should definitely take it with him. He's a genius and is also hilarious (in a young math professor kind of way).",
    "A difficult but extremely fun class",
    "'Twas a very interesting course. The problem sets did tend to be very difficult, but going to the problem sessions made them much more manageable. Asaf was an excellent lecturer and always presented concepts very clearly. I think the biggest knock against this class is that so much of the grade depends on the final, which is only 5 problems, so missing a single problem on the final can essentially bring you down a letter grade.",
    "The material for this class is awesome, and Asaf does a great job presenting it. Discrete math is fascinating, albeit extremely challenging. I had no exposure to combinatorics, graph theory, or proof-based math before this and struggled to keep up. However, you do come away with a lot more knowledge and appreciation of the beauty of math. There were 9 homeworks (30%), 1 take-home exam (15%), and 1 final (45%!!!!!). The homeworks were killer, and exams brutal. The homeworks took me 10+ hours a week, and I wouldn't have been able to do them at all without going to Asaf's office hours or the TA's help sessions (Andrei is super helpful if he is the TA again). There are help sessions EVERY DAY though, so if you are committed to doing your homeworks, it is 100% possible to get full scores on each one, as long as you spend A LOT of time doing it. I spent SO MANY hours per week for this class. I wish the final wasn't such a large part of the grade, especially since it is meant to be an introduction for people with no background. I feel like I learned a lot, and got near full-credit on the homeworks and midterm, but don't think I ended up with a good grade at all just because the final was so challenging and worth the bulk of my grade. Another thing, this class is full of super smart people who've done discrete math since birth and do competition math for fun. This is intimidating (unless you're one of these people, in which case good for you, but please help the rest of us out!) You're probably not taking this unless you have to. I like Asaf and I would recommend him.",
    "Fantastic class, the most fun math classes I've taken at Yale. The proofs are fun to think about but the grading is lenient so your problem set solutions don't have to be too rigorous, especially if you've never taken a proof-based class. Asaf does a great job making the material approachable, and he's very fair. P-sets are challenging but rewarding. Final was difficult.",
    "Learn some cool tricks to solve interesting problems. Asaf is enthusiastic and smart, but his lectures make it very easy to zone out as he proves most theorems more than once. Problem sets are a manageable 10 hours per week, and the final exam was reasonable.",
    "Excellent class",
    "Discrete with Asaf was a great class, and the material is really interesting. If you like solving trick problems or riddles, this would be a great class for you, but keep in mind that if you have little to no proof-based math experience, it might be a bit more challenging, though definitely doable. For the psets, try to solve the problems on your own for a bit, but if you get stuck, dont hesitate to work in groups to toss around ideas.",
    "This class a bit all over the place. You learn a lot of different tricks for solving combinatorics and graph theory problems, but it does not feel like there is a main theme. The problem sets are tricky and fun, but not too stressful. Essentially the answers to the questions on the p-sets are easy to write up once you figure them out but usually tricky to solve. This made the p-sets a fun group activity to struggle over, but when you were pressed for time in a week you could always go to the TA session get the answers and just write the up quickly. The exam was very stressful because it had the same types of questions, tricky to solve and super easy to write up. The exam was 2.5 hours long and it could be completed in less than 30 minutes if you knew the answers, but it was a huge struggle to figure out how to answer each question hence nobody finished early or at all.",
    "This is a fun, but hard class. I would say that the techniques learned in this class is similar to that of competition math. Mostly combinatorics and graph theory. THE PSETS LATER ON ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND NEED TIME. We had a take home pset as a midterm, and the final was not as difficult as the psets.",
    "Perhaps to a math major, but even then, i've warned people with less background in proofs away from it. It's a hard class with a pretty sizeable workload (if you want to understand the stuff). It's something i'd only recomend to people who think they might have need of the knowledge or are really into proof based math.",
    "Great class if you like solving problems and math. The problem sets are hard but can be solved by going to office hours or help sessions. A worthwhile class where you will become better at math. The problems you work on are pretty cool and different than other math classes. If you are applied math major or cs major take this over CPSC 202 unless you really don't like math.",
    "Good coverage of lots of techniques used to solve problems in discrete math, with half dedicated to combinatorics and the other half to graph theory. Professor Ferber himself really enjoys graphs, so you get to cover lots of interesting ideas and problems there. Homework are all pretty manageable, and working with classmates helps a lot, as some of the problems require good bits of insight.",
    "A challenging but great class.",
    "This was a great class. The professor really cares about explaining the material so that everyone understands. Even if you understand what's going on in class, the homework is extremely difficult because you just have to see the solution, and if you don't, well you should go to section. The TA is very helpful in explaining everything and helping with HW. HW ended up not being stressful because of him. There was a takehome midterm, which was great. The final is almost half your grade, which is very stressful, but there may have been a great curve (about to find out!). It was worth it anyways.",
    "Psets are tough, but with office hours and TA help they aren't bad. Don't correlate much with class, but definitely build off of the easy examples done in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The material was extremely interesting and fun.",
    "You should take this class. It's a whole new way of thinking. Especially if you don't have a huge math background. You'll be able to do it if you work hard.",
    "It is a great but difficult class. Make sure to go to TA hours and have friends in the class.",
    "Fascinating material. If you are interested in any quantitative field, it is worth checking out this course. Much of the class is not about learning facts, theorems, or techniques, but about learning how to problem-solve, and how to translate problems into more approachable forms. All very useful, and usually a bit of fun, as well. Be sure to see if you like the instructor first, though. The professor for this course seems to change frequently, and a good professor can make a world of difference. Definitely consider this class, but check it out before committing.",
    "I would recommend MATH 244 to fellow students if they really enjoy math and creative solutions. The class is very difficult as discrete is not an easy subject, but you will meet some awesome, smart people to work together with which makes the struggle worthwhile.",
    "It's an interesting class for STEM students. I feel the primary benefit of this class for me was learning problem solving strategies for combinatorics or graph theory problems. He homeworks can be challenging, but are doable if you work with classmates or go to office hours.",
    "This class was really hard. The topics are pretty interesting but the proofs are tough. The homework assignments are manageable if you're either a genius or you put in some solid effort. I think I got a zero on the final, so beware.",
    "Take the class. It teaches you to think in ways you regularly would not or at least much less concisely. Discrete math lets you learn how to think creatively and intuitively.",
    "Interesting class where you learn the basics of combinatorics, graph theory, and other arithmetic tricks.",
    "Take it for the problem sets and the CS major requirement. Go to class to keep up with what's going on, but don't really expect to have to pay too much attention in class.",
    "Discrete math was pretty cool, but much harder than I thought it would be. The class is full of people who are pretty good at math, and while it starts of with very basic counting, it picks up after a couple weeks and doesn't really slow down. Definitely don't judge it by the first two weeks.",
    "Half combinatorics, half graph theory, great fun. Work is definitely backloaded so account for that."
