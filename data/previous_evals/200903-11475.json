    "This course teaches you the mechanics of writing a grant proposal. It is useful for all BME majors.",
    "BME seniors have to take this class. This is a great class. You get to know the major fields of research in BME, and this course helps you pick a senior project lab if you haven't done so already. Not much work.",
    "Yeah it was cool. I enjoyed it. It was very laid back and a nice complement to a hard course schedule.",
    "i would definitely recommend this course but of course everyone in it is a BME major and has no choice but to take it",
    "This senior seminar is a good class. It is low stress most of the time - you need to go to seminar once a week, but you don't have to do anything before class (you can read papers posted if you want). There is a final grant proposal paper that throughout the semester you turn in small assignments related to your final paper. Good class, you probably have to take it for BME major!",
    "Just sit and listen when there are presentations. Relaxed atmosphere. Student presentations are not that difficult.",
    "Weekly lectures by different BME professors and you write a proposal on \"anything\", but for most people it's your senior research. It's good, gets you more knowledgeable on your research and you are exposed to many fields. You have to take it, but it's not painful.",
    "Very little work aside from the final paper, which this year was broken up into several small assignments - super manageable. You get to hear speakers on a variety of topics, and Dr. P makes it a point to bring in some M.D.'s since a lot of us are looking at med school: if you are, these speakers are more than happy to let you shadow them, and if you aren't, their research is still interesting. Other than the pieces which will make up the final paper, no outside work, and you don't have to take notes on the speakers' presentations. Since you're not taking notes, class can seem kind of long.",
    "You create a research proposal throughout the semester while listening to guest lecturers discuss their research."
