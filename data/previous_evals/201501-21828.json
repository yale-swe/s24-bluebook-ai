   "comments": [
    "Absolutely would recommend. It is not a light course though, definitely need to make space for real time commitment.",
    "The course is a great extension of the Fall Semester course (though it is by no means required to have taken CHNS 168). It taught various aspects of business, from business\/economic paradigms (e.g. Long-Tail Theory), to the state of private and foreign enterprises in China, to Chinese commercial law. It is really well taught by Zhang Laoshi. The class is surprisingly econ heavy, so knowledge of econ would probably be an advantage (I never took econ, but I definitely feel like somebody who has would have a slight advantage in the class). If this is not the first Chinese course you are taking at Yale, then expect some more of the same: every class must be prepared in advance so that quizzes and dictations may be navigated, every week there is homework and a listening comprehension, and every so often there are essays and exams and oral exams to be done. The work is somewhat voluminous, but never particularly overwhelming so long as you don't fall behind. For those who are considering taking this as the first Chinese course, two things: be forewarned that the class has a lot of work and will be taught at a faster pace than you may be used to, but also do not get discouraged: much of the work is quite routine, and once you get used to it, you'll find that it's easy to plan and budget enough time to get all of your homework done. Overall I would recommend this class to anybody who has any reason to be curious about business in China.",
    "If you like Chinese you should absolutely take this class. It is probably essential if you want to work in China, but is also worth taking just to finish off your Chinese education."
