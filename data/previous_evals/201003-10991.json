    "I would really suggest that this course require a prereq in the linear algebra theory that the course covers through the first 3\/4. Then the course would be able to focus more on linear systems and control theory, instead of delving into the background theory so much.",
    "Good content but not as applicable to research.",
    "Yes,I would recommend this course to a fellow student. The assignments are hard, however they challenge you just enough to keep you hooked and are not so hard that you would completely give up. Some HW problems give further insight into the subject. Prof.Morse also drops bits of information in the class that relate to the physical significance of some of the more mathematical concepts covered in the course."

   "comments": [
    "The course has certainly piqued my interest into how control systems can be generalized. As an engineer, I don't usually think of systems in terms of generalized abstractions, but this course has certainly got me thinking more towards that end.",
    "I hope to use the concepts learned in this course in other advanced controls courses that I will take in the future. I see this course as having helped me build my understanding of abstract concepts in linear algebra and how they relate to controls. I hope to apply these in my research as it progresses to a stage where a more rigorous approach is called for."
