    "Take this course if just to hear Frank Keil speak. He's a very stately, very professional, very brilliant man who also cares deeply for his students - a rare combination. Sure the exam questions thing can be difficult if you're having a rough week already, but on the whole, he makes it very easy to learn and enjoy and marvel the subject. I'm not a psychology major, but if all of the professors in that department are like him, I might consider switching.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because the grading and assessments are straightforward, there is not much outside work until the end of the semester, and it is actually pretty interesting.",
    "I initially took this because I thought it would offer a good foundation in developmental neuroscience, but over the semester, I realized that I came to really dislike psychological methodology as they are laden with confounds, purposeful statistical framing, and generalizations. So if you are a more science-oriented individual, I would avoid this and take a relevant biology course in either E&EB or MCDB. However, if you are a psychology major, I would take this course in a heartbeat over more questionable courses like Social Psychology. It is a decent survey but you may become angry at psychologists like I did.",
    "Developmental Psych is a good class. Can be somewhat dry at times and if you are a psych major chances are you've already learned a lot of information but it's interesting and not too complicated.",
    "Interesting topic. The lectures tended to be boring, although Professor Keil is certainly very knowledgeable. The midterm and the final questions were based on a pool of 20-30 questions given out ahead of time, which was very helpful. Sections and the corresponding reading responses\/progress reports were far more work than I expected and not particularly rewarding. However, having the progress reports was helpful to fleshing out ideas for the final paper. On the other hand, having both a final paper and a final seemed like too much and was overwhelming come finals period.",
    "A great course!! Make sure you're willing to put in the effort for the assignments though. The workload is a lot but its really worth it. I learned so much about developmental psychology. Professor Keil wrote the textbook so lectures go really well with readings. The tests are an interesting format but you do learn a lot from studying for them.",
    "Whether you are a psychology major or not, psyc 140 is an incredibly interesting class and the material is useful for anyone. Were you a child once? Is it possible that you will have a child one day? Take this class. It's not a lot of work (except around exam time) and Professor Keil is absolutely amazing. I wish I could take the class twice!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Having taken four psychology classes thus far, this has been my favorite! t seemed a little bit dry in the first half, at least for me. But the second half deals a lot with the development of personality, moral thought, abstract reasoning, social roles, and more. Lectures were interesting enough if you paid attention and the class was very well structured. Working groups also provided a nice way to get to know other students and debate fun topics that were relevant and applicable to life.",
    "Cute babies and interesting science. Definitely take it!",
    "I thought Developmental Psych was a fascinating class. I love learning about children, and we learned about so many facets of growth and development in such detail. Professor Keil is a sweet and brilliant guy who is obviously passionate about the subject and knows a lot about the field. Although lectures could get a bit tedious and you have to pace yourself to keep up with everything, I thought all the material was super interesting and worth the work. You do need to put in the hours studying for the midterm and final exam, but I think I'm going to remember the material for a long time because of the way he structures it. Working groups are awesome and they help you work on your final paper a little bit at a time starting way in advance so you aren't completely overwhelmed at the end of the semester. Definitely would recommend if this is a field you are interested in! It takes some work but I found it so worthwhile. Babies are amazing!",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Keil felt like a grandpa teaching the course and he managed to cover a lot of material in a really engaging way, particularly for a small lecture throughout the semester. He engaged with the audience and really knew what he was talking about, drawing from his own experience as well as the psychological explanations for development. Workload isn't too extreme, midterm and final and a large research paper, but that is spread out really well over the course of the semester.",
    "A lot of information in a lot of lectures. You learn about some interesting studies though!",
    "Solid, standard, run-of-the-mill psychology course. Would recommend to majors, particularly those looking to fulfill the social science core requirement, and any non-majors interested in things like education or even just why kids always do the darnedest things. Not a very stressful class, since you get a list of possible exam questions beforehand for both the midterm and the final, though preparing all of them takes a considerable amount of work. Final paper is kind of fun since you get to propose a novel research project, though the instructors hold your hand a bit too much throughout the whole process for my taste (sometimes it made me feel like I was still in high school). Weekly debate responses and progress reports are a minor hassle but no big deal, and the working groups are quite a bit more fun than regular sections as long as you manage to get along with the other 4-5 other kids in your group. Another reason to take it: you get to watch a lot of videos of babies and little kids doing hilarious things like yelling at each other in gibberish.",
    "YES TAKE IT!!!",
    "Brilliant course! Come for the insights into human development and the wonderful professor, stay for the excitement of lecture and the classroom camaraderie. 100% would recommend!",
    "Definite recommend!! For psych majors trying to decide which electives to take, you really should know developmental. The Working Groups are also the best type of section I have ever been in. The tests can be a lot to study for, but at least you have a sense of what you'll be getting in advance (questions given beforehand, 5-7 picked for the actual tests)",
    "2 exams, for which you get essay questions in advance to learn. Textbook is great to learn from. Lecture is pretty straightforward. Professor Keil is awesome.",
    "Dev Psyc was a great class, a small lecture with about 30ish students. Keil seems stern but he's like a smartypants grandpa who really knows the stuff (you read his textbook after all). So in theory you either go to lecture or read the textbook, but you at least go to lecture because it's small and the TFs came to every class. My TF, Richard Rick Ahl, was super helpful during section and office hours (Esp for final paper) - loved him. Peeking at the syllabus, you'll see it's structured in a way that the work is forcibly spaced out so you won't be scrambling last minute (even if you are, it'll be on you and it will still be very managable if stressfu). Yes you have working groups (Aka section) and they're very focused, but it's not too much of a commitment and helps contextualize the class, esp through informal debates (which I love) and evaluate final paper drafts. There are weekly responses but they're short, sweet, and not hard, so easy way to bolster your grade. Exams = all questions given in advance (25-40) and 5-7 will be asked - just study in advance and go through answers in study groups and you'll be fine. TL;DR: perfect if you like the material, want a structured class with deadlines to hold you accountable, and thus really managable assignments. Totally recommend.",
    "If you've taken a bunch of psych courses, I would not recommend this class. The reading isn't necessary to do, it is super redundant with the lectures. The sections were actually my favorite part."
