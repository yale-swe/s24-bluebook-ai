    "If you're interested in the material, take it. You'll learn a lot and be pushed to change the way you've always approached critical thinking. If you're looking for a gut, this isn't it. There is a lot of readings, and the papers are held to a high standard. But it's not impossible, if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "Take the class only if you are in the Religious Studies major.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to students who have sufficient knowledge and curiosity about religious thought and social scientific methods, and to students who are dedicated enough to really engage with the books and discussions. For these students it will be very rewarding."
