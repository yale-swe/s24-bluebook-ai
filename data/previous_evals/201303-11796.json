    "People often dub this course \"Scrapbooking 101\" but it's really a lot more complicated than that. The depth of the material took my by surprise at first, but in a good way. I would definitely recommend this course to a friend.",
    "This class looks at all the different ways we have of representing a person's life. We explore everything from headstones to found objects. There are weekly assignments where we capture the visual biography theme for that week, and we use different mediums such as text, photography, and film. There are some trips to various places on campus like the Art Gallery and the Medical Library. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it lets you explore different types of art and ask questions about what makes up a person's life.",
    "This class basically explores how to tell another person's story through a variety of artistic mediums. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It not only teaches you art skills, but also how to observe the world around you.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you love typeface, interesting albeit odd projects, and are interested in exploring Yale.",
    "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know how to begin summarizing this class, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it necessary because I would absolutely NOT recommend this class to a fellow student. This class was the bane of my existence freshman fall. I slaved over weekly projects and then received minimal clear feedback. Jessica did not seem to know how to teach a discussion class."
