   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, take this class! Your French improves so much over a semester because you meet everyday and the classes are conducting solely in French so you're immersed in the language and must use it to communicate. The texts are interesting and varied, albeit a little depressing, and you get to analyse them in detail. Even though there is a lot of work, the course has been meticulously planned so that it never seems overwhelming. Fantastic! Love French 140.",
    "I thought French 140 was a very solid language class, and that you should definitely take this class if you want to develop advanced grammar and reading skills. Some of the stories and books that we read are pretty interesting, and I liked being able to apply my French knowledge to more real-world situations, as opposed to simply doing grammar exercises. However, there are a lot of grammar worksheets as well, and there is generally a substantial amount of homework, often busywork, each night.",
    "Fren 140 is a course in advanced French grammar, although about half of the class is dedicated to reading comprehension and discussion. You'll read short works from a variety of Francophone cultures, Andr Gide's Symphonie Pastorale, and a book about the Holocaust that's popularly taught to French schoolchildren. The class ends with a ten-minute oral presentation on a subject of your choice, which seemed a little daunting at first, but ended up being really rewarding and interesting! Mme Sherak is kind, understanding, and really passionate about literature. We had some wonderful discussions about the books we read and the history we were studying. However, her class was a bit disorganized, and we often ended up cramming grammar for the tests rather than really absorbing and learning it. But overall, a very nice experience!",
    "Absolutely recommend. My french abilities have grown an astounding rate this semester.",
    "Take it with Sherak. She's fun and interesting, but make sure you do the homework.",
    "Great!",
    "Yes I would recommend if the student wishes to pursue french at the higher level.",
    "Absolutely yes. If you've taken French before and are thinking of switching to a different language, DON'T DO IT. The French department at Yale is amazing, and although the work is tedious at times, the course is definitely worth it in the end, since it really makes you a better French speaker\/reader\/writer. The only thing is that if you place straight into L4, you might have a harder time than the people who've taken L3, since the course is pretty much a close continuation of the previous. However, either way, the class is definitely manageable.",
    "You know how when you started studying French, you had this fantastical image of a moving, vibrant, expressive professor that would just make you feel French and fall in love with the language and culture? Madame Sherak is that dream brought to life. TAKE L4 with her. As for the course itself, you're still going to be learning grammarhopefully they will have updated the course-packet and audio programs before you take it. A lot of the readings are depressing, but at least make for interesting and vivid discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anybody who wants\/needs to take French. The class is never boring and you WILL improve your French significantly. Great class."
