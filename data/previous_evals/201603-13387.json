It combines sampling and design, fieldwork, GIS, writing, social assessments, and interacting with landowners all while working as a member of a team. I understand that the course provides us the opportunity to apply our skills, however, I felt that not all of the topics necessary to create a management plan were covered in depth by the instructor."
