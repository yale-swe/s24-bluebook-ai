   "comments": [
    "Yes. You'll learn loads, but it will be a struggle. You'll have to have an inherent affinity or talent for computer graphics. If you despite math this class will be difficult. If you're like me and are okay at math, and are a decent programmer, I highly recommend asking questions during class and googling homework assignments like crazy.",
    "A really interesting class that gives a (I think) pretty exhaustive overview of graphics. The workload is a little heavy, knowing C++ makes a huge difference as opposed to just knowing C going in, but the projects are fun and lecture is interesting. Prof. Rushmeier is a good teacher and cares about her students. Go to lecture!",
    "Take it if you're interested in learning how computer graphics are stored, modeled and rendered. It's heavy on math and theory, but assignments also involve programming. There are two larger projects: implementing ray tracing, which is cool but a lot of work, and a final project, which is an OpenGL game. Building a game is cool but it's really separate from all the low-level work you do before that point.",
    "Great overview of how computers process and display graphical content (2D\/3D). A bit dry and mathematical, but the homework and especially the final project are super fun--make your own game! Prof. Rushmeier is very enthused and engaged, and that also makes it a good course.",
    "CS478 covers a lot of wonderful material that is very useful to know in programming (such as making videogames from scratch), but by \"covers\" I mean \"makes you learn on your own\". Barely anything is actually taught or explained at a level that makes it useful, and most of the time they even explicitly tell you to learn something entirely on your own (like all of C++, OpenGL, FLTK, etc.). The projects are fun but very time-consuming since most of the time will be spent learning how to use tools that are not even directly related to computer graphics. I enjoyed the class because I'd already had experience with these tools, but I wish it could have been more accessible to others.",
    "First of all, realize that this is not an \"easy\" CS class. The midterm project, the ray tracer, is very involved and difficult and consists of finishing a poorly-documented program in C++, and will take forever. There is also more math than you might think, with lots of matrix manipulation (takes some getting used to). Lectures can be less than helpful and problem sets can have questions you have no idea how to solve (nor could anyone, if they were going just on what is taught in this course). Still, it's interesting and you make pretty pictures and a game for the finalproject. Read the other reviews.",
    "This course is a survey of a variety of topics in Computer Graphics. Apart from weekly homework assignments, one has to write code for a Raytracer (given starter code), as well as do a final project that has to be a video game. The latter two assignments, although time consuming, are incredibly fun and useful. Although linear algebra is not a prereq for this course, it helps tremendously. Without that background some of the assignments may feel a bit tedious or difficult but Professor Rushmeier does her best to keep everyone on the same page. Overall, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale is is definitely worth the investment if one is interested in Graphics.",
    "If you were already interested in Computer Graphics (particularly if you're interested in games\/animation\/visualization), this course would give you a great survey of the field. There is one time-consuming ray-tracer project in the middle of the semester and one potentially time-consuming final project (up to you to determine how time-consuming it is), where you get to make a game. Everyone seemed to enjoy building their games."
