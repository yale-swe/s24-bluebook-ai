    "All the projects were solving actual problems for actual clients.",
    "I enjoyed working with students with joint FES\/SOM backgrounds- the difference in approach to problems was enriching and informative. I enjoyed working for a client with particular expectations, and responding to those expectations. I enjoyed challenging assignment, the subjects of which I was not very familiar with. I learned a great deal about working in the business world, especially when compared to the government or policy world.",

    "I'm not sure the lectures were all that useful. The time could have been better spent meeting with teammates or individually with the instructor. Finding time for everyone to meet three times a week in addition to class was pretty hard.",
    "None. However, the experience of everyone depends on your projet, your client, and your team. If all three are great, you will have a great experience.",
    "Some of the lectures were more relevant to specific types of projects than others",
    "Grading system - 50% of the grades comes from the instructors evaluation of your work in the team. It is not clear how this evaluation was done.",
    "Rather than only having meetings once a week. Having scheduled times for us to actually get work done would be useful. So tailoring those meetings to be times for us to get together to act or delegate, not only discuss progress (or lack thereof).",
    "Not much. Maybe more prepping of the client so the students can get started more quickly.",
    "weekly meetings with the prof were not necessary and tended to drag on; once or twice a month would have been sufficient.the actual classes\/guest speakers were not particularly helpful as they didn't always relate to our individual projects. more hands on classes (like trying out marketing or financial analysis)may have been more useful."

    "Yes.",

    "Of course.",
    "The project result was very different than I hoped for. Same with the possibility of continuing a relationship with the client. That said, I learned a lot about flexibility and changing your goals and expectations as needed. So, I think it ultimately was not what I expected but still very good.",
    "Besides some challenges with the client, yes.",
    "I think I got a great deal more than what I expected. There are very stark differences between working in a strictly business environment and working for an NGO or a policy-oriented organization. I also learned a great deal about myself as a professional and as a person."

    "I was very disappointed with my teammates. This is the only group project I have done at Yale where my teammates did not step up to the plate. Perhaps the fact that neither of them were FES students was a factor. It felt like their priorities were different.",
    "I had a great group and we all had different strengths and worked really well together. It was a very good experience and we produced a better product than we would have individually.",
    "Advantages - Great learning experience. Team mates keep each other motivated. Progress is great and the team was very productive.",
    "The advantage is that you get the mental and creative input of everyone. Also everyone helps out with the work so it is less of a burden on one person.Disadvantage is when one person takes the lead, then sometime the rest of the members sit and wait to be told what to do, or alternatively feel that they are being bossed around.",
    "advantages - teaches you strengths\/weaknesses in group, more realistic work setting for the 'real world', learn to work with different personalities\/skills, etc. really good to leverage different interests and skills.disadvantages - different work ethics, different ideas of success, leadership, opinions.",
    "Dividing up work was extremely important. Scheduling very busy people is hard.",
    "Working with different people always helps me learn more about myself, and helps me identify the areas I need to improve on to become a better professional. My team members were extremely professional, but they came from different academic backgrounds, which was extremely enriching.",
    "Learning how to manage a project team was very useful.",
    "I liked the team evaluations - that was a good idea. This class can really only be done in teams because of the amount of work."

    "If you want experience with financial modeling, make sure to ask up front about that. Some projects do, some don't. Choose a client who has worked with the clinic before or is local. It was really great to get to meet the client, see their offices, and develop a relationship with them. Some other clients were not so available.",
    "get as much as you can out of your client(s)",
    "Pick good teammates.",
    "Take it!",
    "Make sure workplans are well done and followed as closely as possible. Plan to turn things in well before finals start if possible.",
    "The work is great - definitely take it if you want to learn something new and want to be in consulting.",
    "Make sure you establish effective communication with the client very early. If you need them to respond within 72 hours of an email or phone call, make sure you are both on the same page about that. Outside of school, some organizations work on very different timescales. For this project, it doesnt work if the client does not respond for 3 weeks.",
    "very group based class, but real world practical skills. fun!",
    "Choose the right project.",
    "It helps to research the client company as you are choosing which company to work for.",
    "Front load your projects",
    "Choose a project you are really interested in - you will spend a lot of time on it. Don't worry as much about sector\/company.A devoted\/engaged client is also important but you cant always determine that before."
