    "Absolutely take this class if you have any interest in early modern Europe. Professor Jordan is wonderful and the class material is fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class--Professor Jordan is incredibly kind and helpful and you will learn so much without having too stressful or painful of an experience. Highly recommend!",
    "This is a solid seminar with an excellent professor. If the material at all interests you, take the class! You can't go wrong.",
    "A incredibly interesting class that takes the Golden Agenof Spain and presents it through the view of every kind of person who lived at the time. The end of the reconquista from a spanish and moorish point of view, the view of the church from the point of view of a little boy to that of a king, and the view of leaders from then view of the common people of the time to the romanticized views we may have today. All incredibly interesting and in the end, it makes it so that we can answer the big question oursf. The course was centered on \"Was the Golden age really a Golden age or was it a time of turbulence and dissidence?\" Before the course I would had said \"Why Golden Age of course!\" Now I could make equally good arguments for either. I would absolutely recommend it to another student, but my advice would be to organize his\/her time well and allot a given amount of time to the readings each day. If there is one thing I regret it's reading fast and not savoring everything there was to read."
