   "comments": [
    "Buildings and Power is low-stress in comparison to other classes. Readings, due to the fact that many are highly technical, are actually not essential to the class. Attendance and attention in lecture are. Lectures are enjoyable and each comes with a fairly detailed handout, so the ratio of carefully listening to furiously taking notes is blessedly low. Also, no mandatory papers! Take the class!",
    "Buildings and Power is a fantastic course that is filled with interesting examples of beautiful architecture serving a purpose. Professor Genoni makes the course completely manageable and fun, plus she has lots of personal research relating to the cities covered by the course. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking for something a little different - you won't regret it.",
    "The intersection between architecture and politics is an interesting perspective, but I feel like the topic could've yield a lot more nuanced, sophisticated conversations that simply weren't included in this class. The class has a heavy emphasis on the professor's own research - which is fascinating to read about, but should not represent the body of research that's been done in the field. The course could use a bit more organization and \"driving the point home\": a great part of this class is just a bunch of random correlations thrown at you while it remains unclear why a particular work is being discussed. Also, there were few moments in lecture that moved beyond stating the obvious: the only insightful part of the course for me is the discussion of how the Palazzo Medici moved from the tower-piazza model to the fortress-courtyard paradigm. However, this doesn't change the fact that the entire class is still basically about finding the new and recognizable parts of a specific building\/sculpture - if it has both, then it has power, that's it. It gets old really fast and there was technically nothing new during the second half of the course. I felt that there was just more new examples of old theories to fill the time. There were other moments when she tells jokes not to help the learning, but just to elicit a few cheap laughs. We spent two of the lectures watching movies. I wish it were more intellectually rigorous. Dean G is very passionate about teaching and rarely loses your attention in lecture. She is strict, but fair. But she can be very narcissistic. She ostensibly displays her close relationships with certain Berkeley students taking her class, which could make others uncomfortable. She gives a lot of individual attention to students, but it also feels like high school. Also, her extra credit questions on the exams make me question how much this class is concerned with serious scholarship. In terms of workload, all you need for a decent grade is to go to lecture. You don't have to do any of the readings because the exams are almost entirely based on lecture. Before the exams, professor will give you a list of 2-4 readings that may come in handy, so no need to do extra work beyond that. A good 5th class.",
    "This is a very interesting class, Dean G is very passionated about what she teaches, and class was intriguing most of the time. The tests are harder to study for because there is so much information.",
    "YES! If you want a fun course to learn about something totally different, take it! If you can put the time in to show up, pay attention, and be open to learning about a way of thinking about art history (in terms of power) then definitely take this course. It is not too much work, and you learn a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "Take this course if you have never taken an art history course. It may be too easy if you are already an experienced art history major.",
    "I would definitely recommend people to take it. I already have!",
    "Very didactic and interesting",
    "A tour through Italy and the societal, political and historical implications of art and architecture. I would absolutely recommend it because its a history class that exposes one to art and architecture and the way in which it has been used to attain power throughout history - fascinating idea.",
    "Very cool history course. Its a great distribution of architecture\/engineering ideas, historical and political ideas of study. The tests are exactly what the professor says they will be, so are the surprises. Its a great class to take if you want to take a fun Yale course....pay attention in every class and you will be fine.",
    "Interesting class on Renaissance Italy",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in art\/architecture\/Ancient Italy or is just looking for an elective class that has interesting material.",
    "Extremely interesting and makes you appreciate the architecture around yale",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I would be hard pressed to find someone who did not enjoy it.",
    "Would recommend it as a solid fifth class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. For not a lot of work put in (no mandatory written papers), you will learn about things for the joy of learning - and you will remember them for life."
