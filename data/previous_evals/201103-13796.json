   "comments": [
    "The library lacked many of the bibliographic resources I needed to complete my research paper. I had to rely heavily on the books I could acquire through interlibrary loan. I suggest the library develop a program that seeks out student suggestions for which books to purchase as part of their collection.",
    "All resources were available. Never a problem at YSOA.",
    "I do wish that the library held longer hours near the semester's end, so as to allow for more work to be accomplished, especially as the due date for papers nears. That one has to compile one's research around the hours of a library does not seem like something that a university would wish to propitiate. However, I would assume that such information (in one form or another) would be made available for the students at least at this crucial point in the semester. I mean, really, closing at 5p on a Saturday while opening at 2p on a Sunday? Our fabrication labs don't have such limiting hours, nor do some other university libraries, so why should our collection?",
    "The library's hours are a joke. It's sad how inconvenient their hours are."
