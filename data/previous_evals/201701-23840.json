    "This was a very useful course. I feel like I became more organized with my scientific ideas and my writing became clearer. In addition, it was a chance to delve deeper into some topics other than what I work on in the lab and this will help me in the future.",
    "What can I say about this course...it was worse this semester than last semester. This time around, the instructors did not even provide feedback (except for Dr. Nguyen several weeks after--which was admittedly helpful feedback, but not useful in the sense in could be used to improve future assignments) making the weekly assignments even more blatantly \"busy work\" than anything useful.",
    "As with the first semester, Seminar once again helped me develop my grantsmanship skills. As the semester progressed I became more and more comfortable with reading the papers and identifying possible questions that still needed to be addressed.",
    "Learned grant writing skills."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: introduces new fields and concepts; requires high level of logical thinking and writing; introduces faculty we would not otherwise meet; fosters interesting discussion; improves presentation skills Weaknesses: limited or not very consistent feedback",
    "The strengths of this course lie in its ideals, and the weaknesses lie in its execution. The idea of the course is great, but when feedback is not supplied, there is no point in writing the assignments, as we do not know whether we are doing a decent job or not. The different styles of the professors is also hampering to continuity in the course.",
    "More timely feedback would be appreciated. It is difficult to improve on our writing when we do not receive feedback in time for the next submission."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Although it is challenging, it is very useful in many aspects.",
    "Absolutely not. This course is tons of work for no return. Writing the weekly assignments was a waste of time, and being in the class almost more so. Admittedly, some of the guest lecturers did provide their opinions on individual student's specific aims, but I was far too put off by the course to appreciate anything being said.",
    "I would recommend this course to all incoming students. While it seems daunting at first, the skills garnered from taking the course will help one throughout their graduate career and beyond. At the end of the class, you gain the ability to more critically dissect papers and identify what issues need to be addressed. This class also enhances your scientific writing ability and, at least for me, helped me hone in on a concise scientific rhetoric for all of my mock grant submissions."
