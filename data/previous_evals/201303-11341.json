    "So . . . you read a bunch of tales that are as obscure as they are bawdy. Despite the title \"Medieval Humor,\" this class is all about the Fabliaux. It will be fun. You will learn. You will become comfortable with saying \"cunt\" in class.So yes, take this class. But only if you're interested. One of the best things about was that it was a small class and everybody was into it. Don't show up, looking to slack your way through a gut. It might appear that you could, but you'd stick out like a priest's testicles (and those tend to get cut off).",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It has a lighter work load and fascinating literature in the syllabus. The teacher is a wonderful man and a professor of the highest order.",
    "A close reading of the fabliaux genre and an exploration of the nature of comedy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! There is something wonderful about taking a medieval course with Professor Bloch - I loved being able to strip away a lot of modern theories and interpretations that students might want to automatically throw themselves into after several literature classes at Yale. Though the Fabliaux seem like crassly amusing and pointless tales, they give way to extensive discussion about all aspects of life - marriage, social class, humor, family. I also love the way Professor Bloch uses the time we have in class because he's never in a rush, and our digressions are always very meaningful.",
    "Take it. It is fascinating in ways that far exceed the realm of what you may believe to be medieval lit. I had no prior knowledge, but really found myself looking forward to the class every week. The humor theory\/philosophy material is a great supplement to the fabliaux. Highly recommended."
