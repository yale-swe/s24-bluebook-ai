   "comments": [
    "This is a complete waste of time.",
    "This was a great class, I learned alot",
    "The course had a diverse subject matter and was relevant to my division and area of interest.",
    "I don't think this class should be required. Reading papers and analyzing them seems trivial at this point in the educational track. We get this info in epi.",
    "I liked the presentations and the issues they brought up. The homework fed well into the overall teaching objective. I just wish that the pedagogical method did not rely so heavily on lecture. More interactive learning could help.",
    "I was surprised that this is a requirement for SBS. Did not think that we covered new material in this course and would have like the flexibility to take something else at this time. Felt like a bit of a repeat of measurement issues.Would have liked more information on how the final assignment may or may not be carried over into Trace's class next semester...still wondering about that.",
    "The class strengths were the variety of topics covered, including the various guest lectures that brought expertise in a number of subject areas. It might have been interesting to work on the paper in a different way though. The review was very intensive and challenging. Since there is no TA, I realize a rough draft and feedback would be difficult. Instead, perhaps if students could partner with one or two others and read anothers paper to provide \"reviewer comments\" similar to a peer review process it could help us to refine and improve the final papers, as well as to understand how to peer review.",
    "This was a good course. I wish it was a bit more academically interactive. With more feedback or small projects throughout.The weakness I saw was in discussion. Students didn't usually base their comments on research but rather individual feelings. Sometimes the discussions borderlined an alcoholics annonymous meeting or rehab of some sort. I like my fellow students, but I also don't need to hear about their personal issues in the middle of a class.",
    "Nice course. Come in hear a lecture, participate a little, and you get out early most of the time. CHeck out the syllabus but everyhting was easy.",
    "The course was just ok. The types of interventions covered were actually fairly broad and interesting.",
    "The discussion component was well-executed, but a more general assessment of prevention theory would have benefitted class.",
    "The course started strong with interesting, engaging, funny, and informative, but Melinda sort of gave up teaching as the semester progressed. The topics became less interesting and class seemed to just be a formality. She admitted that she did not care about the material and it showed in her lectures. Most, if not all, topics were covered in Epi II and measurement issues.",
    "Unfortunately, a lot of the material covered in this class overlaps with SBS. And, we should have spent more time talking about intervention design.",
    "This course was well designed, all of the main topics that are important to preventive interventions were discussed.I enjoying the discussions in class that allowed many of my classmates' experiences to exhibited to re-iterate the theories and ideas taught in class.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this course. Onthe one hand, I enjoyed attending class each week and thought we generally had interesting discussions about different papers. On the other hand, I don't feel that I had learned anything new by the end of it. The course offers you the opportunity to learn about RCT design, read and critique intervention papers, and write a literature review\/critique. It's not difficult or particularly time consuming, and Dr. Irwin is an engaging lecturer. But at the same time, I'm not sure there's enough material covered to justify this as a semester-long course, and don't feel that I gained any particularly new skills or insights at the end of it.",
    "-I thought Measurement Issues this past spring was the most useless class I\u0092d ever take. Well, guess what\u0085I was wrong!!!! At least measurement issues gave assignments that forced you to think a bit.-This class was total misery. I learned jack shit, was bored out of my mind, and felt that it was a complete waste of time. Thank goodness we almost always finished early...but at the same time, I'm not sure how I feel about taking a class that always finishes early. There should be enough material and preparation for the full hour and 50 minutes.-Final paper? Absolute BIGGEST waste of my time. And I needed that time to do final assignments that required intellectual energy. OK, so I learned a bit about my topic, but it\u0092s nothing I couldn\u0092t have gotten on my own. Otherwise, writing 20 pages summarizing approx 5 articles is totally pointless. Thank goodness I liked my topic -- I would have gone nuts if I had to spend all that time dealing with something I wasn't interested in.-Other assignments were total bullshit. Yes, it's blunt. But it's true.-I remember Dr. Irwin saying the first day of class that this class was supposed to prepare us for Trace\u0092s class next semester. It absolutely did not do that. And now I am extra-terrified for Trace\u0092s class.",
    "The readings were very useful and will utilize them in the future. Also enjoyed the guest speakers.Would have been helpful to have the syllabus and readings posted online. Would also like more detailed feedback on essays submitted throughout the semester to know what the instructor wants, and to determine which concepts students are mastering, and which areas need to be worked on.",
    "strengths - fascinating materialweaknesses - none come to mind",
    "It was interesting to learn about all the different prevention programs and initiatives that are in place for different diseases. I enjoyed the fact that Dr. Irwin brought in experts in the particular area to teach us about the difficulties in implementing prevention programs in their field. There too many mini assignments and I felt I was saying the same things over and over again at one point. It would be better if the professor had assignments that were worth more as oppose to multiple assignments that were similar and worth less."

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Irwin does a good job of commanding respect for who she is and what she does. I liked her, even though I don't want to be on the other end of her debates about daily exercise.",

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0See above.Feedback and grades seemed random. Her feedback was sometimes \"Well argued, but I disagree\" (and she took off points as a result).",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0The lectures should not be based on PowerPoint so much. But other than that, Dr. Irwin's presentations were good: succinct and interesting.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0good lecturer, charismatic, engages students well",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin was a great instructor. She had interesting anecdotes to make the lectures more applicable to the real world and also encouraged us to discuss and talk about our own experiences and contribute to the class.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Professor Irwin is a good lecturer, especially when lecturing on topics on which she's an expert. I think the class died down a bit toward the second half of the semester when a lot of guest lecturers started coming in, but I enjoyed Dr. Irwin's classes.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Great professor.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0-General comment: I don\u0092t understand why she is an SBS faculty member. Exercise research with cancer patients\u0085this strikes me as more of a CDE type of thing. Endpoint has to do with cancer. Exercise is physiological. It really doesn\u0092t seem to fit with what the SBS department is all about.-Apparently, you can\u0092t do well if you don\u0092t agree with her! I got an H on every assignment but one. When the deviant assignment was returned to me, I looked over it to see absolutely no writing other than \u0093I don\u0092t agree. HP.\u0094 Are you fucking kidding? It\u0092s not the grade that pisses me off here\u0085it\u0092s her bullshit explination.-I really got the impression that she had zero interest in anything related to this class (with the exception of the first few classes on exercise, of course). She barely even prepared \u0096 making a few slides with basic statistics on them and then spending the rest of the time discussing the articles we read for HW couldn\u0092t be more of a waste of my time. And it\u0092s not like we actually critically discussed the articles, it was a bunch of superficial crap, which is why I stopped reading in-depth.-I found her attitude to be very condescending, though I'm not exactly sure how to explain it. I generally felt there was a superiority complex.-She should never ever ever ever come to class chewing gum!!!!!!!!! No professor\/speaker should!!!!!!!!!!-Oh, and if I don't exercise 5 times a week (at least), I'm going to hell. I get it.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Good lecturer and very encouraging to have students participate during class. Also really liked the class topics. Felt they were very applicable and relevant to public health research today.The instructor was also very accessible via email and during office hours.Would have been nice to have more detailed feedback throughout the semester on assignments to enhance our understanding of the subject matter. Also would be good to read literature reviews prior to the end of the semester to help with the final project.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0She's concise and presents only material with substance. She requires the same of her students. I would rate her highly."

    "A good introduction to behavioral interventions for different diseases.",
    "This is a requirement for SBS students, so many do not have an option but I do not think that it is a necessary class.",
    "Good opportunity to learn about interventions and study design issues. Final project is a great chance to learn about a given subject and also to practice a review of literature. Reasonable course load and engaging discussions took place in class. Yes, this course is recommended to those interested especially in behavioral interventions.",
    "I would recommend if the student is looking for a qualitative course and not worried about the quantitative nature of interventions.",
    "Take it if you want a nice easy epi course that reviews your knowledge.",
    "Course was just ok. I'm not sure what I learned from it yet. The lectures were interesting, but the coursework was boring and involved pretty much just critiquing articles, which we've been doing ad nauseum for two years.",
    "Solid introduction to prevention topics.",
    "I would NOT recommend it.",
    "It is a good class to take if you are interested in designing interventions. The final project will help you research a particular public health problem and you can think about interventions you would like to propose.",
    "yes, good course and useful info gains",

    "I'm sorry that you're required to take this course. If you're not, just leave now, unless you want a class that is a frustrating waste of time. Just bite the bullet, read the required articles, participate a bit here and there, and start working on your final paper early because it is incredibly time-consuming.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students who are interested in designing and implementing behavioral interventions and randomized clinical trials. I felt the class really improved my understanding of randomized clinical trials and critiquing randomized clinical trials",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone because it gives you an overview how to analyze prevention intervention studies. However, it can be repetitive at times."
