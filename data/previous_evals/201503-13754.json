   "comments": [
    "Take it if you love screenwriting and you want to learn its basics and fundamentals!",
    "Definitely take this course. The environment is really relaxed, you learn a lot without getting a ton of work, and even when assignments are longer, they're relatively fun to do",
    "I would if they are already interested in screenwriting and linear narratives. It doesn't feel like there's much room for developing screenplays in general -- ones that aren't necessarily linear. So I would only recommend it to someone interested in that particular kind of storytelling.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS BECAUSE YOU WRITE STORIES THAT ARE FUNNY AND THE CLASS IS FUNNY AND YOU LEARN AND NOT A LOT OF WORK IT IS GOLD",
    "EXCELLENT seminar. Light workload, yet incredibly satisfying. As a STEM major, this was actually my favorite class of this semester--do everything you can to get in. Price inspires, and every seminar was a treat. By far the best class of this semester for me, and one of my favorites at Yale.",
    "YES. That's all.",
    "This class is a very precise and thorough approach to the crafting of a screenplay, beat sheets, and treatments. I definitely learned a lot--Professor Price is great at giving you the tools you need to continue screenwriting in the future.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn how to structure a screenplay and begin their own individual project.",
    "Definitely take it!! If you're interested in writing and the entertainment industry, absolutely take it. If you're not, STILL TAKE IT. Learned so much about storytelling and screenwriting. Also, not too much work. Weekly assignments that do not take that long. DEFINITELY TAKE IT.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class - it's been one of my favorites at Yale. Brian is amazing, funny, and great at making his expertise available to his students. The work is very manageable, and even better, it's lots of fun. The class focused mainly on the structure of screenplays, and I now feel like I have the knowledge and understanding of how screenplays work to really put together my own projects. Take it, it's a dope class."
