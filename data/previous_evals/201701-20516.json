    "To be honest, I didn't take much away from this class besides a reinforcement of basic microeconomic concepts. I didn't find the reading exercises from the second half of the course help my understanding of innovation. Instead, we just rudimentarily summarized previous research.",
    "How to be an innovator",
    "Analysing innovations and the factors that impact them.",
    "Not much",
    "Great overview of papers",
    "I learned different methods in calculating the incentive to innovate across different types of firms and different types of technology (drastic vs. non-drastic). The second half of the course taught me how to actively read an economic research paper -- questioning what the author is doing and how he\/she is doing.",
    "Learned all about innovation and how it affects economic growth",
    "Reading analytical skills. Helped me determine what was important in economics papers",
    "I learned different theories about how innovation can affect markets and which scenarios provide more incentives for innovation in the macro economy."

    "strengths: professor cares about his work class is well organized according to a well-defined syllabus weaknesses: class engagement \/ participation is low presented material can be a bit dry",
    "I wish that the class was a bit more structured after spring break.",
    "The best part of the course in terms of actual learning was going through the economic concepts of replacement and efficiency effects. I think it would be interesting to look at case studies of these effects and see how they actually manifest themselves in the real world. I think a major weakness of the course was the paper summary \/ presentation format post-Spring Break because I didn't learn much from the papers and class engagement was incredibly low.",
    "Guest Speakers who are well-known innovators",
    "Well prepared although the exams were too long.",
    "Strengths: gutty Weaknesses: boring as hell",
    "Great all around course just needs more engaged students",
    "The Professor creates a very comfortable environment for learning and asking questions. The sequence of material makes sense and the end of the course ultimately puts the student in a place to apply the theoretical framework of innovation to real world settings.",
    "People need to show up to class more",
    "Strength: Interesting subject Weakness: Some of the papers we were tested on had pretty intuitive and obvious conclusions and little applications for the real world."

    "you'll be exposed to the theoretical economics of innovation and you'll learn how to read, analyze, and respond to an economic research paper. However, the class material is a bit dry and you'll find that class participation \/ engagement tends to be low.",
    "This is the kind of class where you never really know what's going on, but is not intellectually difficult, so if you're looking for a senior econ course that won't break your brain this is good. The second half of the course gets very tedious with two paper responses a week, and I'm honestly not sure how the course is graded. But it was relatively painless.",
    "Take this course if you need the ECON 400 credit and don't care about not learning much.",
    "Take this class because it will change the way you view the world (in a good way)",
    "Yes, great econ credit",
    "Pretty chill level 400 econ",
    "Haphazardly organized (the second half of the class is entirely student presentations on economics papers vaguely related to innovation) and constantly teeters between asking much to little and far too much of one's baseline economics and econometrics knowledge. But Igami is a sweet guy, not at all a bad 400 level.",
    "Good 400 level econ class",
    "Take this course! It is a great 400-level senior economics course. Professor Igami is the best -- he wants to see you do well! He may try to scare you during shopping period, but I promise the course gets a lot more interesting and less intimidating after the first 2 weeks or so.",
    "Yes. Great Class! Students just need to be more committed."
