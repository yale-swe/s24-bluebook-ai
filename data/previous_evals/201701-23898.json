   "comments": [
    "It felt like a lot at times, and it also requires a weekly meeting outside of class. The workload split is a bit weird depending on the makeup of each group. Since this is a class geared towards theatre managers, they were often left with more work. In general though, it was doable.",
    "I don't have a solution for this comment, but I felt like we stage managers were fairly useless to our groups during SRP and Spring Project and Rep techs. There is a noticeable dip in our ability to attend any meetings or produce any work\/content when we're in tech week. (Although maybe that's just part of group projects in grad school? Our classmates were fairly understanding but I'm sure they were annoyed some days.)",
    "The workload for me was the perfect combination for the course. It wasn't daunting; it was inspirational.",
    "The amount of work required of this class is somewhat disproportionally distributed. The theatre managers are asked to do far more work than any other department, and while the class is technically a theatre management course, it is presented as being for all of us. The overall work required felt very appropriate for the length of the course and the course objectives, however having more mini due dates thoroughout the semester might have aided in time management when it came to completing those assignments.",
    "I thought this course had an appropriate amount of workenough to be a really meaty course, while no assignment felt gratuitous. I do think different positions within the MPP teams don't always have a balanced workload. I felt our managing director had the most work, while our stage manager had the least, given the nature of the assignments; I don't know if there's anything to be done about that, and I do feel that all members of our team stayed engaged regardless.",
    "The personal workload did not seem overwhelming, though it felt appropriate. I feel that the group workload was a bit higher, but spread out between many."

    "I completely forgot about our online resources, which would have been extremely useful time savers for the project. Reminders about the resources would be helpful (although if I'm the only student with this problem, then that's all on me and nevermind!)",
    "I wish there was one more class after the group presentations for people to share what was useful or not useful about how they went about their process as a theater company. For example their was a google doc that our Artistic Directors used when trying to consolidate what shows to pick for the season that I didn't know about in the moment, but afterwards when they showed us I thought was just a really useful tool to keep in the back of my mind",
    "The course was organized well. Each class covered a different aspect of managing the production process and the information was presented in a clear and digestible way. The documents we were given were also very well organized and I feel confident that I will be able to refer back to them in the future without any confusion.",
    "I felt the course was very clearly organized, and I benefitted from each distinct lesson in turn. I don't know if this slight deficit was intentional, but I would have loved to know more about commissioning and commercial producing before the Millicent Megabucks negotiation assignment."

    "I really enjoyed Vicki as an instructor--she has a great, approachable teaching personality and offers detailed feedback, while also being supportive in class.",
    "Vicki is great! A wonderful resource for theater management.",
    "There are some inconsistency in the the description of what the XYZ Theatre has. And that may be part of the project to make sure we are paying attention and asking the right questions, but if it's not supposed to be doing a cross reference of the different documents to make sure they are consistent would be useful for the future I think.",
    "Vicki Nolan is a gem. One of my favorite instructors in YSD, i'm so glad i got to study under her. I feel set up for the near future in so many ways. Very inspirational and charismatic instructor.",
    "Vicki is a really excellent teacher. She presents the material in a way that is clear and not intimidating for newcomers. She wants her students to succeed and she is good at encouraging a classroom environment that involves worthwhile debate and healthy competition. Vicki often answers questions with examples or annecdotes and that makes the material much easier to understand. Her wealth of experience is a huge asset and her students benefit from it tremendously. It was alsoo inspirational for me personally to have Vicki as an instructor. She understands that as a woman in upper management, one faces certain challenges. Vicki moves past those challenges with tact and grace, but never allows herself to be bullied or made to feel small. That example has been vital to my growth as a student and an aspiring artistic director.",
    "I found the instruction clear and well-paced, with a density and depth of information covered at a brisk but manageable rate. Personalized feedback on our group's work always felt focused, like our work was really being seen and considered by a very present mentor.",
    "I felt that the class and material was laid out in a logical and easy to follow order. I did not have much experience in this topic and it was great to learn a new aspect of the business from a seasoned and easy to follow professional."

    "Overall, great visitors with helpful comments.",
    "The visitors were fantastic. I learned so much from them!",
    "The visiting guests were great! I very much enjoyed those classes and hearing from professionals in the field.",
    "All the visitors were great - I really appreciated the ones like Gordon and James who didn't pander to our assignment, but just gave big broad strokes overviews.",
    "Each visitor brought wonderful insight. They were a great addition to Victoria Nolan's already great pedagogy.",
    "It was great having all of the artistic and managing directors visit the class. Just experiencing the difference in energy with both conversations between Yale Rep's and Long Wharf's artistic and managing directors was an education in itself.",
    "All of the visitors were very interesting and informative. There was also a good balance in terms of topics covered by visitors. I appreciated that our visitors included members of the YRT, New Haven and NYC theater communities.",
    "James Bundy's visit was super informative, both in terms of general strategies for season planning that are broadly applicable, and in terms of enriching my understanding of the Rep. I also loved Sue Frost's visit. Her combination of regional theater and commercial producing expertise really complemented the curriculum, and she was an engaging and informative speaker. Gordon Edelstein shared a more sobering vision of regional theater season planning. He's not someone I would as directly emulate, so it didn't have the same inspirational feel, but I think hearing from a regional theater without all the advantages afforded Yale Rep is essential.",
    "The visitors were very helpful in our process and I referenced what they said often.",
    "Having visitors\/professionals from the industry was a great perspective into how others approach and deal with real world factors. It was also great to have a honest and candid look into how someone else deals with a season.",
    "Everyone was fantastic! It was great to hear from people who work in different theaters, roles, and industries."

    "I very much enjoyed this class for the practical experience we gained in planning and budgeting a season. Though this exercise is ultimately for a hypothetical theatre, there were a lot of lessons to be gained from the process. At the same time, it was invaluable in teaching us how to learn as a group.",
    "I learned a lot and will take what I learned with me into the field!",
    "Overall good experience! All of the pros and cons one would expect with a group project. I think that the Stage Management students should learn about Equity rules before we take this class. Equity rules and calendars are the skills we have to offer in the group project, but we dontt have that AEA background until 2nd year.",
    "best decision of my emerging career to audit this class.",
    "This class was really useful for me. It filled a big gap in my knowledge, and I think that I will regularly refer back to things I learned this semester. The class is a good overview of the many aspects of managing the production process and I feel that the interdepartmental nature of the class will fuel future collaborations at YSD.",
    "I feel I became much more confident leading a team and fluent in budgeting and planning. I hope to reference my notes from this class for years to come.",
    "Very difficult and very valuable. Improved my leadership abilities, my excel abilities, and my overall understanding of how budgeting happens.",
    "I learned a lot about how to work with other people and actively collaborate in an administrative setting."

   "comments": [
    "This actually isn't indicative of Vicki's teaching, but the class seems to bring out some ugliness in terms of the feedback we get after our presentations. In general, I didn't appreciate some faces made during presentations, as well as the shadiness from specific classmates. I know this isn't something that can be monitored or controlled, but if Vicki is so supportive during presentations, I don't understand why some of our classmates can't be as supportive.",
    "A few more specifications in the XYZ Theater resources would help clarify questions in budgetinge.g. what do we have in stock, do we have a shop crew or do we have to budget for that, etc. I also think that we would have benefited from a reminder about \"assuming good will\" during presentations. I think groups often felt like they had to defend their choices to the class,but we would have benefited more from listening to our classmates thoughts and saying \"You're right, that would have been a good idea.\" Generally having more room for discussion, feedback, constructive criticism, and offers from classmates (instead of that instinct to defend each theater as \"the best.\") I'm mostly offering this thought because I thought (1) it was helpful when John questioned some things on my calendar that I hadn't thought of and (2) it was in good humor when Matt made the comment about better crew pat but the rest of my group was all bent out of shape about their classmates \"throwin' shade\" around the room.",
    "I'm not really sure how, just due to the complexities of Excel, but try to encourage groups to spread out the workload of the Artistic Budget beyond just the TM's in the group. Excel Online helped for us, to a degree.",
    "Everyone takes that class for different reasons which sometimes can make the group project part a little harder because some people are dedicating more time than others. There's nothing really to do about that, but just something I noticed. I also wish there was a little more of how past theatres presented their work available to see. Though I did enjoy having to do it all from scratch with no subconscience input from the past",
    "My only suggestions is that class that I wish it was mandatory like Drama 6 and Drama 50. I feel like this is the perfect course for cross-departmental collaboration. It's been foundational for me.",
    "I do wish there was an opportunity to collaborate with people outside of my own group. In-class assignments that gave us the opporunity to work with other class members would have been nice.",
    "It felt like all the groups had a bit of a mad dash to finish their work at the end. I don't know if that's avoidable (or if making the teams set their own timelines is part of the pedagogy), but maybe another interim deadline to keep people on track? I loved this class!",
    "It would be nice to hear more from each of the groups more throughout the semester so the final presentation doesn't feel like a competition. I enjoyed learning what everyone else was envisioning, but since we only heard about it twice in class there was a tense atmosphere around everyone's projects that dampened the experience. I also would have loved to get feedback on our final projects. We try to create budgets and supplemental material that were as realistic as possible, and comments on what we submitted would be helpful for the future."
