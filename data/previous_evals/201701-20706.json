    "I learned SO much about intellectual history -- from how to analyze it to simply learning the trajectory of this. I gained so many insights into the rest of my humanities courses. I'm a junior history major and REALLY wish I had learned all this before! Absolutely required material for any liberal arts education.",
    "Lots of really good and interesting information about important philosophers of European history.",
    "I learned so much intellectual history and the History of European thought after Nietzsche.",
    "I learned about the history of european philosophy and received a basic introduction to key ideas in the philosophical canon. Names like Kant, Nietzsche, and Foucault have new meaning for me now that I have taken this course.",
    "I managed to learn about highly complex intellectual movements and ideas throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "Reading and understanding all sorts of people who I had heard of but didn't really understand, and then reading other people who I had not previously heard of but now can \"read into\" everyday life",
    "An important course to take to understand the trajectory of Western thought. Professor Shore is one of the best lecturers at Yale. You have to take it.",
    "I learned much about how History repeats itself and all ideas are everyone's property.",
    "Survey course of different thinkers with a focus on the late 19th and 20th century. I now know how the enlightenment led to existentialism, but that's pretty much it",
    "It was a wonderful overview of western thought since the later 19th century. I have a much better understanding of this area of philosophy.",
    "Intellectual history covers relevant philosophies of various thinkers within their historical context. We talk a lot about the philosophy, but we also talk about the context of these thinkers.",
    "I learned how to think philosophically and engage with thinkers of the past.",
    "Before taking this course I had never taken any course in philosophy. But this proved to he an excellent introduction to some of the greatest thinkers in European History. I think i've learned more material over the course of this class than any other at Yale, and I doubt I will forget it soon -- the material is fascinating even for someone who has no background in the subject matter!",
    "The class was a great introduction to Western thought. I learned about the basics of philosophy and the way it has changed over time.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and certainly the best lecture course. Professor Shore is an amazing lecturer and I feel that I gained an entirely new way of looking at the world and thinking about ideas and history.",
    "A general overview and understanding of European intellectual history going back to Hegel. This adds context and allows me to better understand both historical and contemporary intellectual movements.",
    "I learned about the main ideologies and movements in Europe since the Enlightenment.",
    "An excellent overview of the breadth of intellectual history from Enlightenment to post-structuralism. Given the vast amount of material there is to cover, Prof. Shore's attention to detail and nuance with respect to each thinker was very deft and satisfactory.",
    "I began to learn how to read and analyze older, philosophical texts.",
    "As someone who doesn't have a solid background in philosophy and intellectual history, I thought that this course was a great survey to know and understand a lot about history and philosophy. It gave me a lot of material that I can further expound on or take more concentrated classes about.",
    "I learned about the evolution of European intellectual thought from Enlightenment to Present.",
    "In this class I learned how to read quite difficult primary texts and really grapple with them until I understood what they were about.",
    "A level of engagement with the most important European thinkers of the 20th century that gives you a starting point from which to delve deeper into each of them individually as you please.",
    "I learned about a wide range of philosophers and how their thoughts related to the historical circumstances that they were in. I also learned to write in a more succinct manner.",
    "In this course, I learned the keys that unlocked everything else I had previously \"learned\" at Yale. This class taught me how to think, how ideas can be powerful, and how everything around us is intellectual history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures are amazing - readings are super manageable. I loved every bit of this class!",
    "This course is fantastic. It's designed so well to facilitate student learning: the tests are really good ways to force students to bring the material together, and the essay was an accessible way to delve deeper into some of the topics. The lectures are phenomenal, and the readings are well-designed to be penetrable but challenging, concise but explanatory. I wish every course were designed how this course is designed. I think the only weakness is that some of the themes felt impenetrable until later in the course, but that's why it was great to have to study for a final to bring it together.",
    "Lots of awesome info.",
    "The course becomes a little difficult to follow at times due to the complex nature of the subject at hand. Things however begin to fit together as the course progresses.",
    "The lecture is great, and the readings are helpful complements to the course material. I think sometimes the broader themes of the course could have been made more clear or contextualized historically better.",
    "Professor Shore is a very effective teacher, giving anecdotes where appropriate to bring abtruse academic concepts home to the listener. She always has excellent lecture lines, and preparation is highly evident. However, her kids (while very adorable) sometimes distract her during lecture...",
    "While the overall arc of the course was informative, I found that some of the lectures lacked substance. I understand that Professor Shore does not aim to show the \"right answers\" to philosophical questions, but I found that some lectures did not even discuss *any* answer. I do not understand what it means for a philosophy to be \"edgy\" or \"restless.\" In these lectures, perhaps more historical context would help.",
    "Would benefit from a longer time-slot; some of the lectures were kind of rushed at the end. The non-powerpoint nature of the class works very well since Prof. Shore is a great lecturer.",
    "Great content, great lectures, great TAs.",
    "This course could be improved if there were more of an emphasis placed on the historical importance of each thinker. It was evident with Heidegger, but not with many others.",
    "This is a great class to take. I'm so glad I took such an important survey. Sometimes it got confusing but I think that is just unavoidable given the dense material. Marci Shore is so cool and inspiring and smart.",
    "I thought that the synthesis of thinkers in each lecture was good, but I thought that the grading was really not transparent at all and that the IDs were hugely specific.",
    "Lectures were fantastic! Prof shore is so engaging.",
    "Lecture are absolutely excellent. She is possibly the best lecturer I've had at Yale (I'm a graduating senior). She is warm and encouraging. The course is also incredibly interesting and the topics are really interesting.",
    "Strengths lie in Professor Shore's ability to explain very complex philosophical theories. No real weaknesses.",
    "This course has many, many strengths. The material is interesting and while it feels like we learned a ton looking back, the course actually moved at quite a steady, reasonable pace. There are three major opportunities to check how you are doing, so its not a mystery all semester. And both professors and TAs are engaged in the material and encouraging with students. Honestly, and for the first time ever, zero complaints.",
    "I enjoyed the course. The lectures were always interesting and the readings chosen to reflect the lectures well.",
    "Lecture handouts didn't necessarily map on to what is covered in class. This made it difficult to take notes on these handouts.",
    "I found this to be one of the better survey courses I've taken at Yale. The only weakness I can think of is that the lectures often slip off topic, which is a shame given the limited amount of time and the wealth of material.",
    "Everything about this course was top notch. My only complaint is that Professor Shore's incessant complaining about the Trump presidency made things a bit uncomfortable for students on the right.",
    "Less time on biography, less time on anecdotes about Prof Shore's children.",
    "I don't know that much could be improved. It was pretty great.",
    "This course is an excellent survey course but there were not may opportunities to directly engage with the material outside of understanding its basic tenants.",
    "The strength of this course is that the material is very well organized and Professor Shore is an incredible lecturer. One weakness is that we cover a lot of material and it would have been helpful to have more sections devoted to really mapping out how the ideas connect and the timeline. Also, Professor Shore's handouts were very, very helpful!",
    "Prof. Shore is a truly phenomenal lecturer. Her lectures were absolutely amazing, and constituted the strongest part of the course. The readings were way too long for some weeks, and very hard to comprehend before hearing the relevant lectures. That may be deemed a weakness.",
    "The readings are difficult but well picked. They give a good overview of each philosopher. I think that a visual aid to accompany the lectures would be beneficial.",
    "overall a good overview of some really important thinkers in eurpean intellectual history. unfortunately, the course structure seemed to encourage no more than a mediocre regurgitation of what Prof. Shore said about the thinkers, and section discussions were rarely interesting.",
    "Lectures were engaging and wonderful.",
    "I think the class would be better structured if the professor wrote down the names and important events as she talks about them, just to make sure that all students are on the same page, especially since some of the names are in German and French and can be easily mispronounced or misspelled.",
    "The strength of this course is the breadth of knowledge that we receive just because of the large expanse of time that this course covers. I was really able to gain a clear picture of how European thought has changed based on the historical events in each period. The lectures were extremely interesting and in depth. I liked that each lecture focused on just one person or a group of people. The reading were always very interesting. And section was a very useful time to gain a overall perspective and historical context for each thinker. I also liked that there was a very defined conclusion or take-away from the course. The weakness is perhaps how fast-paced the course is because it covers a new thinker each lecture. I also wish that we were able to cover more of the nuance of each thinker within an intellectual group such as Husserl's Children or Frankfurt School. I found myself cramming during the final to try to figure out what each thinker in a larger group was contributing to the intellectual dialogue.",
    "AMAZING, loved every second of it. Fantastic course and incredibly necessary at this point in time.",
    "The lectures are absolutely great. I actually was not intending to take this class, but I just kept showing up for the wonderful lectures-- and eventually realized it was too late to drop. The readings are a bit too much at times. The Heidegger readings especially were too long and too daunting, but perhaps this is a necessary evil of history classes.",
    "The lectures were very engaging, and the worksheets were helpful to follow along. Since the syllabus was so thoroughly written out, it allowed students to know what to expect every class. A weakness could be that it breezes by so fast because it covers many philosophers within a short span of time; maybe if it could focus on less philosophers with more time spent on each one.",
    "The class is organized in a way that is very conducive to actually learning. The one-thinker-a-week model is very effective, and allowed me to feel like I understood each subsequent thinker. The weeks with groups of thinkers were always harder to follow, because there was too many ideas in too little time. The two women thinkers - De Beauvoir and Arendt - were by far my favorite lectures. Are there more women to talk about? Gender equity is only one issue, as the syllabus is seriously colonial. Maybe the course should be renamed."

   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Marci Shore is amazing - every lecture will leave you with goosebumps, you'll want to do each of the readings (which are super manageable), and you'll come away from the class learning so much.",
    "The best part of this course is when Marci describes a philosopher as \"seductive\" and then you google them and they're hideous.",
    "This is the only course I've ever taken that I would say is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED FOR EVERY YALE STUDENT TO TAKE. Does that not convince you? This course is ALSO the only course I've taken in my three years at Yale that provided an extremely high level of intellectual challenge and intellectual reward while having a relatively low workload. Absolutely fundamental to understanding the humanities and to being a competent liberal arts school. My only complaint is that I didn't take it earlier. The readings are short but challenging, the assignments are useful and doable, and the section (in my experience at least) was actually great. MUST-TAKE!",
    "If this topic interests you at all, then definitely take it. It is great info to know",
    "Absolutely! Professor Shore is fantastic and the class is so interesting. Studying for the midterm\/final is made so much easier by the handouts Professor Shore gives and the paper, although not easy, can be really fun to write.",
    "Definitely! Great introduction to philosophy and european history and no prior knowledge necessary.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Thinkers which feel highly abstract and distant, will gain a new relevance to both 20th century historical events and perhaps your own life. Also, you don't want to miss Professor Shore's amazing zingers (talk to anyone who's taken the class and been to lecture).",
    "Professor Shore will warn you that this class does not provide \"answers\" to philosophical questions. It is, after all, a history class. But the class does not know whether it is a philosophy course or a history course, and many thinkers are given an awkward intermediate treatment, with little historical context but no more than a catch phrase to describe their ideas. Even if you aren't looking for \"answers,\" do not take this course if you want to explore philosophy in depth. It is an extremely high-level overview that can be very frustrating.",
    "This is much more a history course than a philosophy course. You don't focus on evaluating a certain's thinker's ideas and don't really discuss your opinion of the ideas. The class focuses more on how one thinkers' ideas relate to the others. If you generally enjoy philosophy, poli sci, or EP&E seminars because you get to engage with the ideas in the class, this might not be for you.",
    "Yes, the ideas in and of themselves are very interesting, and intellectual history is also a pretty different subset of history--not really about memorizing random battles and the like-- worth knowing about. Prof. Shore is able to demonstrate her expertise in the field by making lecture full of interesting tidbits and analyses.",
    "Definitely! I can't believe I didn't take this class until my senior year. After learning about all of these important thinkers, I realized how much their philosophies come up in my other courses and readings. I feel like I am now so much better able to engage with my other courses now that I have a strong background in European philosophy.",
    "Absolutely - this is a MUST-TAKE CLASS (this is coming from a spring semester senior.)",
    "This is a straightforward course that will broaden your perspective!",
    "This is a great class to take. I'm so glad I took such an important survey class. Sometimes it got confusing but I think that is just unavoidable given the dense material. Marci Shore is so cool and inspiring and smart. She does a great job of distilling the essence of the thinkers' points.",
    "Not really from my side. As a STEM major, I thought that a lot of the comments made during lecture were super over the top (eg the 20th century wouldnt have happened if these two people didnt meet!), and that the material really dropped in interest after the midterm. It's advertised as intellectual history, but honestly all I learned was philosophy with very limited historical or biographical context.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I came away with a much better understanding of western thought, -'d Professor shore's lecturing style is so engaging and accessible. She is amazing!",
    "Absolutely, I would even make it a requirement to graduate from Yale (I'm an econ major). The topics are really interesting, the grading is incredibly fair, it is well taught, the workload is reasonable and fun.",
    "A MUST-TAKE CLASS. I was initially 'meh' about this course, but by the end I really learned a lot and was super glad I took it. You learn about the philosophical musings of thinkers like Nietzsche, Heidegger, de Beauvoir, Derrida, and many, many more. Professor Shore's lectures are clear and engaging - I especially enjoyed when she mentioned her children, who sometimes made cameo appearances in class. In section, you delve more deeply into the readings (which are excellent and well-chosen). Try to get Andrina Tran as your TF if she's still doing it next year she's amazing!!! Workload is as you'd expect for a history course: one midterm, a final, an 8-10 page paper, and reading responses.",
    "Totally! Maybe I enjoyed this course a lot because all me and my friends do is debate continental philosophy, so section was second nature. Jumping into continental philosophy is sorta weird if you aren't familiar with any of the thinkers. I think that due to the broad range of topic covered in this course, you'll walk away with the major concepts of all these thinkers. That being said, it is very surface level discussion. You could have an entire series of courses dedicated to Nietzsche, Foucault, or Heidegger, but you will only spend 1-2 weeks focused on them, tops. Nevertheless, it is an interesting way to get to know the European thought of the 1800-1900's.",
    "Yes! And if not this course please take a course with Prof. Shore. She is amazing!",
    "Yes, must take!!",
    "The first half of the class is a useful and interesting summary of 20th century philosophers. The second half is a repetitive amalgam of crazy, impractical ideas.",
    "Yes. Super interesting lectures and synthesis of ideas from major thinkers.",
    "For me, this is one of the humanities classes at Yale that everyone should take. The lectures are enthralling and the material is fascinating. It's high level and abstract subject matter, but the readings are concise and the tests are very fair. You will come away from this having learned a great deal about the context of the intellectual space that we occupy.",
    "Absolutely - everyone should take this course, regardless of their major.",
    "This class is a great overview of western intellectual thought during the past couple centuries. It is material everyone should learn at some point in their lives. I would definitely recommend to a friend, but be aware that it is not a walk in the park. The paper takes a very specific method of engaging with the material to do well.",
    "I would absolutely definitely recommend this course. I actually took it Credit\/D but never missed a single lecture or section or reading because it was so fascinating and exciting. Every lecture is so enlightening and the course as a whole provided me with a new way of thinking and understanding the history of thought.",
    "Absolutely, this is a great class for anyone it has important contemporary implications, does not go over anyone's head, and is an altogether pleasant and worthwhile experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who does not have a background in European philosophy since the Enlightenment. This course is definitely a survey (a very good one!), so if you are looking for really in-depth analysis this course is not the way to go. This course is an excellent choice if you want a taste of philosophy or just to have a basis for future courses. Professor Shore makes handouts for every lecture that have important people, events, terms, and passages. All of the exam passage ID and term ID are from the handouts. The assessment is very fair.",
    "Absolutely yes. Take it even if you are majoring in the humanities and\/or have done DS. Prof. Shore's lectures will change the way you think about 19th and 20th centuries, and give you a firm background for further study in any of these thinkers and movements.",
    "Great course everyone should take.",
    "Yes, would recommend this class. Professor Shore has a wonderful way of distilling information. She is incredibly articulate and so her lectures are always really fascinating and well described. Learned about important people in accessible but sophisticated ways.",
    "If you don't have a solid background in philosophy, this class will beautiful lay out some of the most important thinkers and philosophical concepts and put them in a historical context that can help you tie them with other important historical events as well as give insights into why certain thinkers were influenced by major historical events such as WWI and WWII.",
    "Yes, you really get to understand how historical events have influenced intellectual thought, which includes philosophical, artistic, anthropoligical thought and more. As someone who had always heard of certain artistic movements but did not really understand their background, this course clarified the historical context and reasons for such movements. Also, you begin to see the world in a new way as you get to notice all the philosphical underpinnings in art, society, and literature.",
    "YES TAKE IT IT WAS AMAZING",
    "great class for anybody, not matter what your major is.",
    "So I took this course mostly by accident. I really wasn't intending to take this class, I just kept showing up for the interesting lectures and then it was midterm. This class has changed the way that I think about religion and about history. The main theme throughout this class is, \"After Nietzsche declares 'God is Dead', what do we do?\". This class made me think about what purpose religion has served, if we can get rid of it, and what to do now that we have. This course also has exposed me to a of incredible authors such as de Beauvoir, Sartre, and Havel. If you are looking for a philosophy course, this is not it. However, I recommend it to absolutely everyone else.",
    "If you want an entryway into 20th century intellectual activity, this is a good one.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in philosophy and who is good at conceptualizing dense material.",
    "Absolutely, yes!!! Marci Shore's Intellectual History class should be required for all Yale students. As a senior, it helped me finally understand what I thought I had \"learned\" in all my previous classes, but didn't realized that I had never actually understood. Professor Shore makes big and intimidating concepts approachable, so that you have ownership over them by the end of the semester. You'll be hooked on intellectual history, like me, and you'll have the confidence to learn more on your own after this course."
