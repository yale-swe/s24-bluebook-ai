    "TAKE THIS CLASS! By far my favorite class I've taken at Yale thus far. The topic of the course is so important to study and Professor Grewal selects the perfect texts to read and leads interesting and informative class discussions. You will become a better writer and a more active thinker.",
    "A fascinating look at the history of Muslims in America.",
    "Islam in America is a seminar about the history of Islam in America starting from slavery to modern day and post 9\/11. I would definitely recommend this class to someone, no matter their level of previous exposure to Islam. It is really informative. Definitely not a religious studies class but rather a history course about Islam in America.",
    "This course is a look at the deep-rooted history of Islam in the United States. Though Muslims reached the American imagination after 9\/11, Islam has been around in America since the declaration of independence. The readings and coursework were always engaging and the 75 minute seminars seemed to fly by. I really enjoyed that Professor Grewal was a very flexible instructor in that she was willing to let the students dictate the direction of discussion, and often incorporated current events into the course as well.",
    "VERY interesting material. Lots of readings and such but not a very writing intensive course. However, I can't speak for next time this class is offered because the professor is very disorganized. When I took this course, readings were about 150 pages of rather dense material. There are 2 smaller papers, and two longer papers: a midterm and a final (8-10 pp). The key to succeeding in this class is to go to the professor a lot. It's a lot of reading but if you think you'll be interested in this sort of stuff, go for it.",
    "\"Islam in the United States\" was an awesome class! I learned so much and thoroughly enjoyed discussing every topic that was covered. Professor Grewal was great at leading the class and she kept it very interesting. I would definitely recommend it if you have any interest in this area of study.",
    "Great course, it gives you a great understanding and vocabulary to discuss islam in america, quite a hot topic in modern politics. Be warned that it is a lot of reading.",
    "Yes! Especially if you want to see if you're interested in ER&M\/AMST\/understanding people better.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Islam in the US is the best class I have ever taken. Professor Grewal is fantastic, the material is extraordinarily engaging, and the class will change the way you think about the world"
