    "If you have any interest in formal models in Political Science, this class is practically a necessity. I would recommend that students seriously consider taking a class in intermediate microeconomics or game theory beforehand, though.",
    "Yes -- despite my difficulties this semester I think the course is excellent, and it opened up an entire world of political science work that was before unreadable and inaccessible for me.That said I think future students would benefit greatlyfrom some kind of text.",
    "I would urge incoming graduate students to consider if they have had several upper-level college courses in mathematics or economics. If they have, this class will be challenging but probably worth it.If they have not, I would urge them to either take additional undergraduate math classes or Intro to Game Theory or both before taking this class, and I would also suggest that they and their classmates lobby for a textbook to be included as part of the class. Even if the text was composed of various chapters from other books and Jud's notes, it would still be a big help.Better yet, I would again urge the department to create another course to start the Modeling sequence, so that incoming students are entering a course designed for them.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because of the prevalence of modeling in contemporary political science literature. However, I would insist on intensive TA-ing and a textbook.",
    "Yes. It is useful."
