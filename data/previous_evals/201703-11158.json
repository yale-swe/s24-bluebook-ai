   "comments": [
    "FREN 195 taught me a lot about new literary techniques in writing. I do not think I developed as much new vocabulary as I learn new modes of expressing myself in French. Additionally, the course clarified a series of types of writing (e.g. portrait, narrative, dissertation, etc.) that I found helpful.",
    "I learned how to write more effective fiction and non-fiction in French. The most important to me are the rhetorical techniques I gained from in-depth discussion of other authors' pieces.",
    "I continued to practice speaking French but mostly learned a great deal about writing in French. We practiced different types of writing, including essays, dissertations, letters\/resums, fiction etc.",
    "This course was very helpful for my French writing. My grammar and proofreading improved, but the greatest change was in my style. We emphasized a lot of stylistic elements of French writing that I would never have learned without this course. It was incredibly useful.",
    "I have taken eight years of Frenchand the best language course Ive ever had is the one Im presently taking, Advanced French Writing Workshop. Each week, we study masterful examples of a form of writingfrom persuasive essays, to character portraits, to literary analysesand then create our own version. Madame Pinzka challenges us to expand our vocabulary, understand the differences between English and French writing formalities, and become competent at writing anything in French. The course succeeds because of a combination of rigorous expectations and constant, individualized feedback. For each form of writing, we are expected to do three drafts, forcing us to continually revaluate not only our writing techniques, but our fundamental arguments and ideas. For each draft, our professor writes personal comments that guide us through our specific struggles, ranging from vocabulary, to grammar, to style. Her feedback is practically useful, but also instills in us an invigorating confidence: someone believes in our ability to improve. The best in-class exercise we do is called Synonyms. Simple but deceptively helpful, students are simply asked to choose any 23 French words that are similar in nature, and then clearly define their nuances for the rest of the class. For me, this is an opportunity to pinpoint an area of vocab confusion, while also opening doors for students to learn from others mistakes. Often times, language classes are stalled because students are scared of sounding silly or incompetent; but because this exercise is predicated on what individuals dont know, the class becomes an inherently nurturing and humble community. The synonyms that individuals pick outfor example, intelligent versus smart; or complete versus comprehensiveallow students to penetrate the superficiality of memorizing vocab and obtain linguistic mastery. In writing, our teacher ensures engagement by allowing us to pick topics that interest us. By leaving prompts open-ended, I have been allowed to write an op-ed about the Paris Climate Accords, a biography of my best friend, and a description of my hometownall topics that excite me to engage deeply with the task at hand. In addition, our teacher engages us by bringing our subjects outside of just the classroom. In assigning us to write a description of a place, we took a field trip to the Yale University Art Gallery, and chose paintings that we were to describe. In assigning us to write an op-ed, she encouraged us to send our work to on-campus foreign-language publications. In these ways, she has fulfilled a student desire for culturally and career relevant pedagogy. The sum of these individually engaging componentshigh expectations, constant feedback, room for error, outside classroom engagementsynergize to make an ideal learning where students grow to their fullest potential. Should I have the privilege of being a Yale-China Teaching Fellow, I will draw upon these pedagogical and curricular techniques to try and replicate this magic.",
    "I came into this course with fairly rusty french, not having studied or spoken any French in three years. This course helped me to regain my french, especially my written French. The course improved my vocabulary and my understanding of the conventions of written French. I feel more equipped now to operate in French both within academic and professional environmentsto write essays, but also to write emails to coworkers, etc.",
    "My French improved SO much through the diverse kinds of writing assignments.",
    "This course taught me how to write French essays in numerous different styles. We wrote argumentative essays, film reviews, short stories, and more, all while receiving wonderful help and guidance from Madame Pinzka. I truly loved this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The only reasonable weakness one can suggest about this course is its time. It shouldn't be at 9 AM ever. Period. Not Lauren Pinzka's fault though, she's a saint.",
    "A strength is certainly that the course is easy to follow. Expectations are clear and the textbook is a useful anchor that follows exactly what what Mme Pinzka is teaching. Its greatest weakness is that is a bit dry. By no real fault of its own, there is only so much to be discussed that sessions felt excessively long and simple ideas had to be over-explained for sake of filling time.",
    "I liked the course a lot. If anything, I thought the atelier's were unhelpful and didn't really help in the construction of the final draft for each project\/assignment.",
    "I'm hard-pressed to find a weakness of this course. I wonder if emphasizing reading more in French would have been beneficial for me, perhaps with a small research-oriented task. We didn't cover how to format citations for formal French writing which I think would be helpful. Professor Pinzka was terrific and I think her thoughtful and thorough feedback on multiple drafts for each assignment was the most useful element of the class. I am certain that preparing for each class on top of giving us so much individual attention was enormously time consuming, but it made all of the difference and was greatly appreciated by all of her students.",

    "This course was incredibly well organized, and I have a hard time thinking of any weaknesses. The structure of assignments was very good, especially the way that some of the longer written assignments were assigned early in the semester.",
    "Only strengths! The structure is ideal for anyone aspiring to improve their writing abilities.",
    "This course is heavily discussion-based, which allows you to extensively practice your spoken French while discussing valuable strategies for perfecting your written French. Students cooperate on peer-editing with the extremely valuable help from the professor. If you seek to improve your French writing in any capacity, you should take this course."

    "Of course, if you want to improve your written French, take this course.",
