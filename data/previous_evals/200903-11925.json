   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student because of the professor. If Master T isn't the teacher then it won't be as enjoyable or worth taking.",
    "I have mixed reviews for this class. On the one hand, it definitely is really easy. Only 2 tests and a term paper, all of which can be done the morning of and you'll still get an A. HOWEVER, if you're the type of person that needs an organized class with clear expectations, DO NOT take this class. It is often very frustrating to not understand a single thing the professor says and not have any idea what's on the test or what the term paper is supposed to be about. If you're the type of person that doesn't get bothered by that sort of stuff, then this class will be very enjoyable and easy. The lectures are fun--if crazy--and it's a nice breath of fresh air from the typical yale class. Plus Master T is the smartest\/coolest person ever.",
    "This course is about learning about black culture and how it started everything in America.",
    "I would recommend it as a must take at Yale. Very different experience. Lectures are like concerts.",
    "Take it for an easy random grade. Don't take it otherwise",
    "This is a fun and relaxing class, and you learn as much as you want to. Readings are interesting although not necessary, so you can really do as much work as you please. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about African influence in the Americas without taking a very demanding class.",
    "Master T clearly knows what he's talking about, and sees art in such a different way from most people one can really learn something from him. His lectures are amusing and you learn alot from them. The readings and the lectures are really different, though, so if you want to do well on the exams make sure you know what the reading covered.",
    "New York Mambo is as much a form of entertainment as it is a course. T dances around the room, exhorting students to join him. He yells and plays instruments, sings and slaps beats on desks. He is a force - take a course with him.The workload is light - if you show up to lecture and take notes, and spend an evening studying before the exam, you'll do well. There is virtually no work throughout the rest of the year, but for a term paper. The prompt is nebulous, but essentially boils down to, \"write why\/how something is black\".T is retiring from his Master position in TD at the end of this year, but I don't know what that portends for his teaching career. New York Mambo is apparently nearly identical to Black Atlantic Visual Tradition - if either course fits your schedule, sign up now, while you still can.",
    "Everyone should take this class, its a lot of fun.",
    "Yes. not much work and kinda fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they were genuinely interested in the subject. It may just go over your head if you don't care, and the class loses a lot of its value.",
    "must take",
    "Totally recommend this course. It's fun and easy. It also makes you look at things from a whole new perspective, whether you believe it all or not.",
    "I would recommend New York Mambo to another student; the material is interesting and the professor is very passionate about the topic. There is also not too much work.",
    "I would say that it is an insightful and fun class and that it is definitely worth taking before graduating.",
    "New York Mambo is a great fourth class for someone who wants an interesting credit but is already overloaded with work and reading for the semester. Not too difficult, and very entertaining.",
    "I would recommend this class if a person is looking for a light humanities credit",
    "It was a very fun and easy course. If you need another course to finish your schedule then take this.",
    "It's a great class and this course was such a joy to take! It was so much fun and I learned so much about African American\/ Latin heritage and their origins.I would recommend this course if you're looking for a course to lighten up your schedule. It's definitely a class experience like no other.",
    "Mambo is a potentially very dull art history class that becomes an exciting experience because of Master T. He has an anecdote for everything that keeps the students interested if not laughing, and his methods of delivery make sure that you remember the material. There are two tests that are very manageable, and the one essay you have to write can be about most anything you've learned in the class. Definitely recommended.",
    "This is a great class. It's very low stress. Lectures are fun and engaging: Master T really likes to get students involved. You learn most of the material in class and you get to pick what to write your 10 page paper on.This class is a mix of everything: there's history of African music, art, and dance as well as its manifestations all over the Americas.",
    "Yes. This is a fun class that is informative and not too exhausting. It reminded me of how much fun learning can be.",
    "Yes of course I would recommend this course because you get to learn about something that you wouldnt ever really learn about yourself in a very entertaining and relaxed environment.",
    "African American Studies could be described as an African Art History class focusing mainly on African dance and song. On top of being extremely interesting it was tons of fun to participate in dances and experience different aspects of African American culture.",
    "It's fun if you need an easy course, but you don't learn that much substantial knowledge. but interesting nonetheless.",
    "Very light workload and interesting lectures",
    "I would say it is a very interesting class which i recommend.",
    "Take it if you want an EASY humanities credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is not that much work, and its a fun class to go to. I learned a lot from the readings, which were all very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you are looking for something that requires minimal daily work then take this class. However, you do have to write a ten page paper, but the topics are very interesting.",
    "I recommend this class to every student at Yale. Whether you think you are interested in the topics discussed in NY Mambo or not, you will love this course, I promise.",
    "It is an interesting and easy class. I would recommend it to another student because it is not much work at all and entertaining.",
    "highly recommended. i'm a potential double major in history and economics so i took this class on a limb with no intention other than to see what is was like. definitely a must-take for no other reason that it exposes you to a totally different side of life.",
    "Good choice for a fifth class if you're in need of a humanities.",
    "This class is awesome because RFT is so crazy and passionate about what he's talking about, however,it's unclear what you really learn beause it's all of over the place. The workload is totally manageable because you don't have to do the reading, only if you want to, and the two 1 hr tests are one essay question. Take it if you want to be thoroughly entertained or want an easy humanity.",
    "It is a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend the class. You learn a lot of things that connect with the real world that you will have in the back of your mind for years to come. Take this class!",
    "The course showed how deeply African culture has influenced the traditions of the Americas. The readings are engaging and Professor Thompson is very dynamic. I'm glad that I took the course because I gained more insight into the world around me.",
    "Take it. Interesting material, not much work.",
    "Great, interesting fun class that I'd recommend to anyone.",
    "Get ready to feast! Excellent!",
    "Yes, take this course. There isn't too much work, and the lectures are wonderfully entertaining. Take it especially if you like the idea of dancing in front of the whole class.",
    "New York Mambo is a quintessential example of a class only possible here at Yale. Master T is an incredibly dynamic lecturer and a pioneer in\/originator of the field. The material covered in this class is unique to it and can seem very airy if you're not really engaging with it. As the class is structured, if you don't really commit to delving into the opportunities it presents, your time is betterspent in another class; however, the class regularly brings in world-class dancers to teach and discuss what they do.It could be one of your best classes if you buy into enjoying it or a cheap credit pick up otherwise.",
    "The strength of the course lies in Professor Thompson's lectures. He is animated, knowledgeable, and truly excited about the material he covers. However, the lectures can also be a bit disjointed, and the tests can be completed just by reading the books and entirely ignoring the lectures. A fun class, a very light workload, but don't expect this course to change your life. Recommended.",
    "This is about as perfect a credit\/d\/fail class as it gets, but it really shouldn't be taken as a gut for an easy A, because it's not. RFT is a fascinating teacher who's lectures (if they can be called that) are as crazy and wild (and as interesting) as they're billed to be. There will be plenty of incredibly funny moments throughout the semester that you will be glad you witnessed. With all that, it gets very difficult many times to understand what he's saying, the reading load is deceptively large, and much of the material is frustratingly abstract when it comes to papers and exams.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was very fun and crazy and definitely unlike any other Yale course you will ever take.",
    "Yes I would because it was a great experience and an interesting topic",
    "take it if you are looking for a relatively interesting class with a light work load.",
    "This class is a good way to delve into the connection between African art and the overall life experience in western cultures. I would recommend this class to another student because it is one where you can learn something that is enjoyable and it opens your eyes to the way African art and culture influences our culture today.",
    "not much work, really fun, need to do the readings",
    "Brilliant class. Robert Thompson is a genius, so if you're at all interested in the subject matter you should definitely hear him talk about it. If you're not as interested in the subject matter, he may change your mind. A good fifth class, interesting readings, easy exams.",
    "TEACHING",
    "NY Mambo is a really fun class. Master T is a trip, frankly, but usually a good one. If you go to class, you'll learn stuff... and be cooler for it.",
    "It's worth taking. It's a pretty low stress class and you learn things you probably won't learn anywhere else.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you are not interested in the subject, Master T makes the course fun and interesting for all.",
    "I loved the course, but that's also because I have some interest in the subject. If you hate learning about dance and music, then don't take it, but since that is rare, especially at Yale, I suggest you try it!",
    "It is a course that if you put your work into it, then it is quite rewarding. There are plenty of interesting things that you would not quite understand unless you take a course like this on them. However, if you just take this class because you heard it was easy, then you will probably do well, but not learn anything valuable that are taught in this class that can be associated to everything in our world today.",
    "Recommended highly, epic course. Manageable workload while still learning a lot.",
    "Fun, unique, easy class to add to your schedule. Go for it.",
    "I thought it was great and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it because this class was a breath of fresh air and a break from the stressful workload Yale offers.",
    "Please don't take this class as a gut. It's annoying. This class is possibly one of the most rewarding classes you can take at Yale, but only if you commit yourself to coming to class, truly thinking about it, and, above all, ENJOYING it. New York Mambo is a joy, and if you open yourself up to smiling and dancing along with it, everyone can reap the greatest benefits from it. If you are going to sit in the back and facebook and snicker and think Lindy Hop is stupid, why are you here?If you are ready--and eager--to sit in the class and open your ears to the sounds of New York Mambo, you will have a wonderful semester, throughout which youboth look forward to being entertained in class, and gain a greater understanding of the connectedness of the art of the world.Try this: on the first day of class, close your computer, put down your pen, and let your foot tap along with the Kongo drumming.",
    "Yes, take this class. This is one of those classes that everyone at Yale should take. Lots of fun and interesting too.",
    "Take this as a 5th class.",
    "yes! take this class!!",
    "Yes- the class is very different from any other class I have taken. You learn a lot about culture and you also get to dance in class!",
    "not good",
    "WORKLOAD: one 10-page paper on pretty much anything even vaguely related to Africa (due by the end of class). That's literally all the work you have to do.TESTS: one hour-long mid-term (two essay questions, which only require a basic knowledge of three books) and one hour-long final (basically the same as the mid-term, with two essay questions, which again require a very basic knowledge of the other three books for the class).GRADING: there are tons of people in the class, so you have to show a little more specific knowledge if you want to get an A, but even that's not very difficult.ATTENDANCE: if you really don't want to go, you really don't have to, except to show up for the mid-term and final (and to turn in your paper). However, I highly recommend attending most of the classes, because they're always fun\/funny; on any given day, you could be singing, dancing, dance-fighting, or just sitting in your seat, listening to Master T tell a hilarious anecdote or try to be the single most random human being ever.",
    "I would recommend this course but keep in mind that it is mostly an exposure to the material rather than a deep exploration. Also, the title of the course is slightly misleading... rather than covering New York Mambo, it consists mainly in the study of the Black Atlantic aesthetic tradition in general- definitely important to learn about.",
    "This is a great class! must take.",
    "Absolutely. It is a nice elective where you have fun in class by doing rediculous dances.",
    "This is an enjoyable course that could make a good fifth class. The information for the course is pretty interesting, and Master T is an entertaining lecturer. He really knows the information and works hard to make class fun and interactive.",
    "This is a good class to take. The material is mostly interesting, and Master T makes lectures fun.",
    "It was a class that you should take if you are really interested in the material, OR if you are willing to take a course that is far from ordinary. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Very fun interactive class. good change up from the typical sometimes boring lecture classes at yale. i would recommend it.",
    "Take this class, lots of fun and interesting paper topics and not too hard at all",
    "Great, easy class. definitely take it",
    "Easiest class i have ever taken. Attendance in lecture is not necessary.. just read the books for the exams.",
    "I would recommend this class! Master T is a great professor!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. It is a fun class that teaches you a lot about the tons of different cultural influences, and is to demanding to where you lose sight o what is actually being taught.",
    "It is a fun class about the Black Atlantic tradition and how African culture has infiltrated the New World; I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "It is really interesting and will be sure to get you out your seat. No literally, he will call on you to join him and other students dancing.",
    "A very new type of class (different from high school) where you get a mix of book learning with practical learning (ie listening to music).Highly recommended.",
    "Fun class. Master t is a legend with a well deserved reputation. Definitely a must take",
    "This is a pretty good fifth class. There are two hour-long tests and one ten-page paper due before reading week. There is a fair amount of reading, but really you can do as much (or as little) of it as you want. You can do fairly well without doing the readings, but at the same time the stuff we're assigned is fun and interesting. The most frustrating part about this class is the fact that it has no real syllabus. It's strangely organized so it doesn't feel like the class has any kind of overarching coherent narrative structure. The lectures are kind of all over the place. The textbook selection can feel kind of random and arbitrary, so sometimes you end up questioning how on earth what you're supposed to be reading relates to the stuff T talks about in class. That being said, the class is an absolutely unique experience. Master T is a pioneer in his field. In no other class can you hear the kinds of crazy stories he tells--about hanging out with Keith Haring and Grace Jones in 80s New York, being interrogated by Latin American guerrillas with machetes... it's unreal. He's crazy, colorful, and totally not PC--this class is not for the faint of heart or for the easily offended.",
    "GREAT CLASS. Always fun and entertaining. And I felt like I learned a lot too. RFT is amazing.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to other students. In one sentence it will expose you to the vast influence African culture has had around the world.",
    "The course was worth while and interesting, with a light workload and engaging subject matter and lectures."
