   "comments": [
    "Understanding how to measure the effect of institutions on economic variables is very useful in designing policy to reform these institutions. The papers we read were extremely relevant to economics in general, reinforcing topics one would learn in introductory and intermediate courses with more detail.",
    "I learned how to read, understand, and (to an extent) evaluate economics research and writing, which is a skill that other economics courses do not teach. I learned to look at events in history with an inquisitive and analytical eye, and to seek out the reasons behind phenomena that we observe in the world. In doing so, my concept of an \"institution\" was expanded, as I came to see it as any construct that plays a role in the organization of resources. I was also exposed to methods of research and analysis that I had not seen before. I was also able to make a first attempt at creating a research paper and economic model of my own, which I felt was an invaluable culminating experience not only for the class but for the major.",
    "This course taught me about reading papers in economics critically, theories of economic institutions, and the performing research in economics. I learned to build models to describe economic phenomena, to employ data and econometrics appropriately to evaluate economic hypotheses, and to criticize the shortcomings of theoretical and empirical shortcomings of different strategies.",
    "I thought the readings were excellent, and in particular I felt like I got an understanding of (a) some seminal papers in economics (b) some ways in which economists test, model, or otherwise understand things that typically resist those types of approaches. I also learned some economic history.",
    "I improved my ability to take a variety of research papers and compare their arguments and views.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is genuinely interesting. It allows us to look into economic history and try to understand the events we see, and challenges us to really consider the causes, effects, parallels, diversions, and seemingly random circumstances caused by the institutions we have created. From my point of view, the course is constructed in a way that effectively minimizes stress while maximizing free space for exploration. We are held accountable for doing the weekly readings, but there is no cumulative exam that would cause us to approach them with anxiety. Instead, we approach them with interest, and the class sessions are a time where we examine them in greater depth simply out of a desire to learn and understand, and out of a realizing that there is so much in there to learn from. I feel that my engagement in learning was much more positive under this kind of structure than in a normal class. The one weakness of this class for me was the fact that the large assignment of the semester - the paper and accompanying model - was never explicitly discussed during class time. We were left largely on our own to figure out how to approach it. In a major where most students arrive in their first seminar with zero experience either writing economic papers or creating economic models, this is a difficult thing to navigate. The professor was helpful outside of class if we were looking for guidance, but I still believe that more built-in, explicit guidance along the way would have helped.",
    "I thought there could be a grade for class participation, which would incentivize students. I think some of the math heavy readings weren't ideal. Despite it being very burdensome, I though the response papers were worthwhile.",
    "Subject matter was interesting but sometimes a bit dry. I think fewer\/shorter readings would've allowed students to engage more deeply with them and have better discussions.",
    "Seminar, all are encouraged to participate.",
    "Weekly worksheets on readings are kind of tedious and repetitive. I felt that they were mostly a waste of time. Other than that, the readings and other assignments were great."

    "This class is designed extremely well. You read 2-3 papers and write a response for each paper due each class. Class is then spent discussing the papers and relating it to institutional design. You have 3 problem sets and 1 final paper. The final paper is written in drafts, so you end up not having so much work at the end of the semester. You come out of the semester having read some really interesting papers that are relevant to political and economic institutions. You also know how to analyze institutions according to their effects on economic variables. Highly recommend this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, particularly someone who is feeling tired out by the economics major or wondering what the purpose of it all is. The material in this class helped me learn how many exciting things are going on the in the world and in history that can be better understood from an economic perspective. The structure of the class (weekly readings and discussion of readings in class, a couple problem sets designed to teach you relevant frameworks but whose material you are never tested on, and a final paper) is one that liberates you to simply learn interesting things and improve your ability to think critically. In this course your are free from the seemingly useless and futile battle against math that makes no sense and appears to have no purpose, and instead you come to understand what kinds of things people actually use theory for. The final paper is a huge opportunity. It is a chance to put the tools and understanding we have spent years of lecture classes developing to use and to create something for yourself. For most Econ majors, this is something we have never done before within our own major, so this is a chance to really take ownership of what you have learned (you may find you have learned more than you think) and do something with it. Professor Espin-Sanchez cares very much about his students' intellectual engagement, gives you an incredible amount of freedom to learn, and is always more than willing to help you along the way.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in institutional economics and the economics of distribution. I would also recommend this course to someone interested in economics research, because you learn to critically evaluate actual published papers in economics. Professor Espin Sanchez has great insights about the different papers, and he is really good at helping and guiding students as they write up the final paper, which involves a research proposal of your own. The only drawback is that sometimes the quality of class discussion is not very high, but I think that very much depends on who is taking the course.",
    "Yes, there is a fair amount of reading, but if you are interested in learning about economic history, definitely do it.",
    "Good if you're interested in theoretical political economy, but can be a bit dry at times",
    "Yes, really opens your eyes to the role institutions play.",
    "This is one of the better senior econ seminars. There are weekly worksheets that have to be completed on the readings that are quite tedious, plus three problem sets that should be no problem if you passed intermediate micro. There is also a final research proposal paper 12-15 pages, but Professor Espin-Sanchez is very good at making sure you are working on it throughout the semester which is actually awesome since it's much less stress during finals. The readings are actually very interesting and include some of the most important economics papers about how institutions affect our world. Would recommend this class."
