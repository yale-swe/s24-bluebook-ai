    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in an overview of the global energy challenge and how different energy sources play into that challenge. The course maintains a realistic, neutral approach. Also, Professor Kessides is really nice and reasonable.",
    "Not too much work, fairly interesting material (if you actually pay attention), though lectures are dry. take it, if you want.",
    "very informative, a lot of information packed into a class Prof.Kessides is extremely knowledgable bout the different economic ramifications of varying energy sources. He is also very approachable and understanding of the needs of the students and eager to help students who need it. The assignments require a lot of writing, so you will become well versed in the topics you write about",
    "yes, very interesting and important material",
    "Just an ok class. Professor Kessides is nice but not particularly engaging, and the material is broad but not very focused. Kessides is very knowledgeable and smart, coming from both a World Bank\/pub pol and engineering background, and has a pretty clear stance on most issues. The class did feel very monotonous and boring at times, but the workload is manageable (midterm and final paper). Just be aware the the final paper is 20-25 pages long.",
    "The material covered in this class is interesting. However, the course as it was taught this semester wasn't really a seminar; the professor simply presented information to us using PowerPoint slides and there weren't really discussions (at most there were a few people asking questions). The class has potential to be more interesting and engaging given the controversial nature of many aspects of energy policy) although this potential can only be realized if the format of the class changes. Workload isn't too bad - two papers (6 pages and 20 pages) and a 2-page research proposal.",
    "One of the better senior seminars (I took 4). Low stress, interesting, Cool topic",
    "Yes, I would!",
    "This was a lecture class in a small room. Professor Kessides reads off of a PowerPoint for two hours on a Monday morning, which is fine if you are interested in energy. I basically caught up on emails and read the news, which was fine because student participation was limited. Professor Kessides is incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and helpful though when it comes to final papers.",
    "Yes",
    "It's a great overview of basic energy policy. Prof Kessides makes sure to take a realistic approach, presenting the pros and cons of many issues. Be prepared for it to be taught as a lecture, but it was actually nice to sit there and listen to important things that everyone should understand.",
    "The course was alright, Prof is nice, but the class turns out to be more lecture than seminar.",
    "Take it. Professor Kessides is an excellent and very thorough professor who deeply cares about the course material and his students.",
    "Take it over any seminar"
