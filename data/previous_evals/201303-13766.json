   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Course was challenging and it may be better if it requires prerequisites so that everyone is at the same starting level. May be good to spend more time on the basics of MATLAB before starting the actual labs.",
    "It was a good general introduction to the topics. Posting the lab answers (to the Word doc) would have made it a little easier to focus on just doing the lab instead of making sure I had the answers down. Having a small project (analyzing a data set of some kind) in lieu of a final would have been something I enjoyed but I can see pros and cons to both.",
    "This class was useful in that it gave me an overview of some of the methods used in infectious disease epidemiology. However, I am not confident that I would ever be able to use these methods in practice on actual data. I ultimately don't feel like I gained a mastery of the material, but rather just an understanding at the most basic level of what the methods are.I think this class is more appropriate for students with an extensive math background (aka, PhD students), and it's a shame that there is not currently a quantitative EMD class appropriate for MPH students. I would suggest that this class be divided into 2 separate classes in the future: one for PhD students and one for MPH students. The EMD PhD students have a much more extensive math background than most of the MPH students, so it would make more sense to separate the class into a \"Beginners\" and \"Advanced\" option.",
    "I think this class has a lot of potential and I think the subject matter was really interesting. However, the class was really math and modelling intensive which ended up leaving me very confused most of the time. If a lot of the math was explained before it would have made more sense.",
    "Strengths were that we had exposure to MATLAB, and had ample class time devoted to practice.Weaknesses included the numerous errors in the lecture slides, homeworks, and even take-home final. The homework and final questions were so poorly worded that to attempt finishing these assignments without extensive help from the TA or professor it would have been impossible. This was incredibly stressful for me as well as the students I spoke to. The labs were also equally stressful- MATLAB is quite finicky, and I would often spend more time trying to copy down the code projected on the screen before she moved to the next question than listening to the reasoning behind what we were doing. Often, I would miss something early on in the code and then spend the rest of the class just sitting there in frustration because if you miss one line of code- you can't complete the rest. So. Frustrating.The visiting lecturers were great, however they often would show examples of the statistical procedures they would use - but NOT IN MATBLAB!",
    "It's a new course so there will obviously be kinks to work out. I think it's great that it introduced so many topics adequately enough that I can go out and know where to start when trying to implement them on my own. It actually did a great job of that and I learned a lot. The level of difficulty dropped off during the semester but it didn't need to-- it was helpful and felt great to actually implement methods being described in the literature, as it's not all that useful to do something so trivial that you don't earn much from it. I would up the quantitative level in the second half and maybe drop the spatial lecture.",
    "One strength is that the course content was organized in such a way that topics built on one another and gave an introduction to several infectious disease modeling methods. While many methods overlap I thought that we were perhaps presented with too much and this course could have been broken up into two classes. The problem sets really helped to solidify the concepts and I think the course could have benefitted from having a few more or maybe even a midterm exam similar to the final exam. Also, I thought at times the lectures focused on a lot of the math theory behind the models which was personally a little difficult to follow. Perhaps the lectures could focus more on the applications and exact steps to building the model versus the theory (just a thought).",
    "The course material is very difficult, particularly for the student's who don't have a background in modeling. I think it will take some time to work out the kinks in this course and make a syllabus that is perhaps less ambitious and spends more time making sure concepts are learned. Asking questions when people have no idea of the answer is not a great way to learn. I would have appreciated working through problems in lecture to learn how to truly understand the formulas and principles before translating it into code.",
    "More MATLAB instruction would have been very helpful. The majority of the time I dedicated to this course was used to try and figure out MATLAB, not the actual course material. I am grateful that we did used MATLAB as this is a skill set that I am excited to have and will be very helpful to me in the future. I felt, however, that there was not enough time or exercises spent going over MATLAB fundamentals.",
    "This was a tough but good class. This was the first time it was offered, so there were some issues with figuring out the level of teaching, but the professor adjusted throughout the semester and got to a good level. It is a survey course of methods for discrete types of problems, which was difficult because there wasn't a narrative of the course, so it felt like (and was) a collection of unrelated lectures. It would help to give some kind of overall plan for the course and an outline for individual lectures, so we could know better where we were at any given time.This course was also really useful--it covered a selection of topics that don't seem to be treated elsewhere, and did so at a high analytical level. I now understand and feel confident doing some sophisticated analyses that had before been very mysterious to me. The labs also gave us code we can use for our own work, which will be useful.",
    "Hardest course I've taken and resulted in countless nights sobbing in front of a computer.",
    "The content is very interesting, but there is too much to cover in one course. It became difficult to keep up. The lecture slides are well made and informative.",
    "The course does a great job in providing mathematical tools to understand infectious diseases and their interventions in a simplified manner. Learning and understanding the software used for the course, \"MAT LAB\" was taxing initially as it can be the case with any new software. Some quantitative topics were quite intimidating.It is an emerging field and the course provides an interesting perspective using approaches from \"infectious disease modelling\",\"econometrics\", \"signal processing\" etc.",
    "This is a great quantitative course for those interested in an introduction to many math modeling techniques used in current research to examine infectious disease. This course is unique because the exercises assigned are often exact replicas of actual published studies on influenza or measles, which gives students practical experience as well as a solid understanding of the advantages and limitations of infectious disease modeling."

    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0She's very knowledgeable and attentive to student questions and concerns.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0I think Ginny will be an amazing professor one day, as she cares a lot about her students and she is responsiveto questions.That being said, there were some major issues in teaching this class. Her biggest weakness, I think, is that she was not able to teach the material at a level that MPH students could understand. Most of the MPH students do not have an extensive math\/stats background, and it would have been helpful if she realized this and modified the way that she taught the material.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Really knowledgeable about the information, but pretty disorganized.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0As this was the first time this course was offered, it is expected that some kinks were present. I'm sure next year's course will run much smoothly in terms of homework assignments and lectures. She was a wonderful teacher and seemed to really care about her students grasping the concepts conveyed during class and lab. However, as this work is more like second-nature to her, while many of us have limited statistical backgrounds and have never used MATLAB before, we were sometimes lost in the jargon and even larger topics she thought we would be able to grasp as intuitively as she had.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Maybe a little nervous but it's to be expected with a new course as it a huge amount if work to put together. I think a slower pace through the lectures and maybe some on-the-board derivations would make it a bit more intelligible and easy to follow, rather than being confronted with an onslaught of equations on slides",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Although this is the first time V. Pitzer taught the course, I thought she did a wonderful job. Her lectures flowed well and I think as time goes on she will be more comfortable teaching the course.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0The lectures were very good but perhaps too dense. I would usually stop following at some point half-way through. I would appreciated less condensed lectures that focused on fewer concepts going forward.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny's responsiveness to our class was nice. As mentioned above, she adjusted the level of the course (lecture and lab) to better fit our class. I really appreciated that most lectures had some basic introduction to the question\/method of the day, since I was not always familiar with them. It sometimes seemed there were a lot of errors in slides or labs, but those will be corrected by the next time the class is offered.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0She has a sincere interest in making sure her students succeed.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0The instructor has great presentations and lab-notes to guide you through some rough \"quantitative terrain\". There was ample help through codes to navigate through the software. The lectures move at an adequate pace to follow.The home-works required modifying codes some of which were time-consuming to understand.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Dr. Pitzer is an excellent teacher who is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter if this course. It was obvious from her lecture slides and labs that significant work went into constructing interesting and informative work for her students. Additionally she chose current research rather than hypothetical situations.Strengths: attentive to student demands, obvious knowledge and care about subject matter, good pacing and awareness of material, approachable, calling on students a useful techniqueWeaknesses: some students obviously had not done the reading wouldrecommend she stress this aspect of the course more, wouldn't wait so long for student to answer a question, would also suggest a matlab tutorial at the beginning as homework"

    "Instructor: Katharine Sassandra Walter \u00a0She's very knowledgeable and friendly.",
    "Instructor: Katharine Sassandra Walter \u00a0Katharine was just okay as a TA. I don't think she went above and beyond her responsibilities as a TA (ie, she knew that many of the students in the class were struggling, but she never offered special office hours to go over things or willingly make herself available beyond the 1 office hour that she had each week). It would have been helpful if she held more than 1 office hour each week, because many of the problem sets were due in class on Mondays before her office hour (thereby rendering that office hour pointless).I also think she needs to work on explaining and teaching things at a level that all the students could understand. The time series analysis lab that she taught was probably one of the most confusing labs of the semester, and that's because she moved through the material quickly and didn't explain the reasons for why we were doing each step of the lab.",
    "Instructor: Katharine Sassandra Walter \u00a0It would have been helpful to have more office hours. Only 1 hour a week during prime class time made it really difficult to get help on problem sets.",

    "Instructor: Katharine Sassandra Walter \u00a0Katharine was wonderful. She was always very attentive to our questions and concerns.",
    "Instructor: Katharine Sassandra Walter \u00a0Katharine was helpfulbut perhaps not so timely with answering emails. I think taking more than a day to respond to emails is not acceptable particularly with a due date approaching.",
    "Instructor: Katharine Sassandra Walter \u00a0Katharine went out of her way to make sure she was available to students. She provided excellent explanations of difficult concepts",
    "Instructor: Katharine Sassandra Walter \u00a0I didn't talk to Katharine much about the class, so I have little to evaluate. The few times I did though, she was prompt with a helpful response. The one lab she gave was good.",

    "I'd definitely recommend it to everyone pursuing a PhD in EMD and most MPH's in EMD too. You need to be able to work\/understand quantitative data somewhat and do some kind of basic computer programming in MATLAB or anotherlanguage no matter what you're doing and this is a good intro to it!",
    "If you are an MPH student, I would not recommend taking it unless you have a very strong math background. You will spend more time trying to de-code the lectures than you will actually learning the material, and lot of the material is not really anything you will ever use unless you're going on to a PhD program.",
    "Survey of quantitative methods for infectious diseases. It gets you to the point where you know where to start in the literature and can figure out what you'd need to do from there. Useful and definitely recommended in its current form, even if it's a bumpy ride at the moment.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The course is a thorough introduction to different infectious disease modeling methods. While we didn't focus on one single method we where able to see how some of the methods are combined and interchanged. I would suggest having somewhat of a moderate to strong math background as it is very easy to get lost otherwise.",
    "Needs a lot of work for future improvements. But it is a good idea and really adds to the EMD curriculum.",
    "This is a survey of advanced analytical methods for various infectious disease epidemiology questions (ex. vaccine-related studies and transmission in various contexts). I would recommend the class, particularly to people who already have a strong quantitative and epidemiology background and are looking to further their skills in those areas.",
    "Advanced information that moves very quickly. only take the course if you are already familiar with matlab.",
    "It is a challenging course providing a mathematical approach to infectious diseases and evaluating vaccines. I would recommend this course because I believe the future of infectious diseases and interventions is headed in this direction.",
    "A great survey of interesting and current research techniques to examine epidemic data. The course focuses on modeling with a heavy coding component such that I would recommend some special interest or a solid quantitative background."
