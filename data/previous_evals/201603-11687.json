    "Meeting every day can be tough, especially if you already have a heavy courseload. However, I think it did really help me to learn Spanish much more quickly. In comparison to other language courses I have taken, this course was as (or more) effective and engaging. Learning languages are hard, there's no way around that, so overall I think this course is very well designed."
