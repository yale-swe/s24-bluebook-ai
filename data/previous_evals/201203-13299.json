    "I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, take this class. First, Guinnane is a really entertaining lecturer. Second, the class is valuable in that it allows you to apply the micro\/macro theory you've learned in a unique (that is to say, historical) context.This is also a good class to take if you're interested in basic strategy at the level of the firm or from an investor's perspective.What you learn is applicable to more than just European history from 1815-1945; hardly any fact memorization required.",
    "This is a very good choice for an econ class that's more on the fuzzy side. Not very difficult and pretty interesting for the most part. Professor is genuinely friendly, if a little awkward and makes an admirable effort to get to know everyone.",
    "Despite whatever good reviews about this class you may read, euro econ history is horrible, just like every econ class taught at Yale- besides some of the senior seminars. Prof. Guinnane is terribly picky and will give you horrible grades unless you somehow manage to produce answers\/write the exact essay that he is looking for. His lectures WERE interesting and I enjoyed them, but his teaching style, the fact that he was a completely unapproachable man, and the fact that he gave out horrible grades made me regret taking his class.ALSO- THE MAN DOESN'T CHECK HIS EMAIL. I know that HE thinks this will encourage students to go meet with him during office hours. BUT he doesn't understand that some people are busy during his office hours. SO if you ever have an urgent question for him and email him, he will never respond. I also felt that he strongly favored the students who made an effort to go and talk to him during office hours. Pretty much if you are a suck-up, you will do great in this class. Otherwise, prepare yourself for extremely mediocre grades on everything.",
    "The course is an overview of European economic history from roughly 1850 to World War I, with a focus on Britain and Germany and occasional cameos from the other European countries and the United States. We covered everything from trade policy to how to make steel to urbanization to banking systems to how the modern managerial business firm came about. Professor Guinnane is funny and an engaging, clear lecturer. One of the better econ courses I've taken, and it's nice to get a historical perspective on economic trends!",
    "This is a great class, especially for mathier history students or econ majors who don't particularly like economics (I consider myself the latter). The workload is sometimes intense: there are psets, a long paper, a short paper, a midterm and a final. But class is often engaging, the readings are interesting and the topic is well executed. It's off-the-beaten-path, but I loved it.",
    "This is a history of Europen economic development in the 19th Century, with a focus on trade. I would recommend this to Econ students, particularly ones who are burned out from theory courses. This is econ in action, and you learn a lot about the genesis of the modern economy, which, to me, is really cool.Be sure to arrive on time and to laugh at Guinnane's jokes.",
    "One of the few great classes in the econ department. Professor Guinnane makes the whole difference.",
    "A fabulous class, take it if you can.",
    "This is a very interesting class. It puts micro and macroeconomic theory into historical context and gives a greater perspective into European history. Take it.",
    "Great course! The professor is one of the best I've met at Yale. The lectures are extremely interesting and the work load isn't bad at all.",
    "Rull good - a great combination between the superstructural things and the underlying mechanisms moving history. Guinnane is great, just roll with his style and you'll enjoy it. That or sit near the back. And know that if you venture an answer you better be ready to defend it. Also good for actually looking at general econ theory in practice.",
    "Definitely take it! It's a great introduction to economic history as a field and lets you apply basic econ that you've learned in the core classes to real historical examples. The reading is manageable, and he walks you through it in lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Material is very interesting. Lectures are engaging and fun. Professor Guinnane is great.",
    "I would recommend this class to any Economics major interested in a different type of economics course. The class does a great job of emphasizing the intuition behind basic economic concepts (something that is often forgotten in other Economics classes) by applying them to European history. The problem sets and exams do a great job of tying back to discussions in class. The reading for the class is greater than what you would find in another Economics class, but they are mostly quite interesting and give you great practice in reading academic economics journal articles. There are 2 papers in the class, both of which I had a good time writing. I found them useful training for possibly writing a senior thesis in Economics. Professor Guinnane is a character, and his conversational lecture style is great. Overall, I had a great time in this course.",
    "It was a pretty cool, not super difficult class. The most econ you'll really need to know is the Solow model. Take it if you like European history or just want to know how a Bessemer converter works. The psets aren't terrible (and he drops one) and the essays are really straightforward. I would recommend it as a 5th class.",
    "This is the best Economics class I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Guinnane makes this class (our TF Cihan is great too though). The course material is fascinating, and it's one of those rare courses where you can apply economic theories to the history. I'm an economics major because I think it aptly describes how the world and humans work. This course helped me to see that economics describes how the world came to be too and the financial institutions that arose from economic behavior. This class made my semester and confirmed that I love economics. Professor Guinnane keeps the class in good spirits with his jokes. They may take you aback at first, but he's actually pretty funny. Also, follow his advice and do things early! And go to office hours! He's a great guy and a great mentor. He's a much more approachable person than you may think! Don't be intimidated. He asks one simple thing of us: just don't be late to stuff. Punctuality is a thing in the real world, so just follow his advice and don't be late.",
    "Econ 187 was the best course I took last semester. Timothy Guinnane is an excellent lecturer and the material is fascinating. The course is really interesting as a whole. It includes three problem sets, a midterm, a short (2 page) and a long (7 page) paper and a final. The course is challenging if you want to get an A, because the grading is a bit rough and you must do all the readings. Overall I would definitely recommend this course to everyone.",
    "A tough class to get a good grade in. There is no curve at all so be cautious.",
    "Good course for those who'd like to broaden their knowledge of economics. For historians, be aware that there is some math.",
    "This was a really solid econ elective, showing you how all the economic theory and models you learned in into classes can be applied to real-life situations. It really is a perfect blend of economics and history. Don't let the subject matter scare you away -- railroads and steel and that kind of stuff sound really boring, but they're so much more interesting when you look at them through an economic lens. Professor Guinnane is pretty good: he's an awesome, engaging lecturer, and he makes it really clear what he wants you to know and what his expectations are for every assignment. He does have an annoying tendency to pick favorites, but oh well. The classhas a lot of assignments, which is annoying: three problem sets, two papers, a midterm, and a final. But the grading breakdown is very forgiving in case one of those things doesn't go well. I definitely would recommend that any econ major looking for an elective shop this class to get a feel for Guinnane's style.",
    "The course provides mostly coverage of the latter half of the 19th century with some before and some up to World War I. Both the content and the professor are excellent. I strongly recommend the course.",
    "Great. The class is excellent. The professor is excellent. Lectures are engaging and well-organized. Expectations are clear. Grading is fair. Readings are quite interesting in the first half of the course and towards the end. I think that's it. Oh, and I enjoyed this course immensely.",
    "Great lecturer but very strict (albeit fair) grading. Apparently no curves and is very strict marker in exams. A lot of memorization but interesting topic (if you're into the British empire). Professor is fair in his strictness though as points are taken off not arbitrarily but when you are unable to link the different concepts correctly or think critically about the topic. Involves papers and psets, so definitely not the easiest or most straight forward economics class. Kinda regretted taking it since I didn't do too well, so definitely think before attempting this class. But if you do excel in this class, it has great materials with a great professor who definitely knows how to lecture and really teach the material."
