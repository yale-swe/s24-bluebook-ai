    "Of course I will recommend. It is such an important course for the archaeological studies.",
    "I recommend Archaeological Studies 719 01 to fellow student interested in Cognitive Archaeology and Museum Studies",
    "Yes, I would like to recommend this course to another students. It is interesting and helpful. It facilitates us to think about the relationship between ethnohistory and archaeology in varied ways rather than telling us what the answer is. Besides, all of us got many chances to express our own ideas formally which are very useful for our professional improvement."

   "comments": [
    "What is the most significant is that we were taught how to use archaeological material and ethnographic documents to learn about people's life in the past. Methods were also introduced. From the presentation by ourselves,we have deeper thinking and usage of the study.",
    "The course helped me much on how can I interpret my archaeological finds through ethnohistorical understanding",
    "Before this course, I thought that I had already knew what would be taught, but it turns out that I was wrong. There is no definite right or wrong answer, but to think about the problem in a broader view. What I learned from this course is far more than the content related to different cultures, but the way to think, which is crucial for my future research."
