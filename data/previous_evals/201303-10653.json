   "comments": [
    "At the heart of this class, there is a very cool concept. That those who don't even have any musical experience can learn how to better appreciate classical music. Nevertheless, I don't think this class is as successful as it could be. I don't feel that I will emerge from this semester as a much improved listener of music. The course, however, has certainly introduced me to the world of classical music, and I am very to excited to explore this further in the years to come.",
    "I would recommend it if you enjoy listening and analyzing music.",
    "I would summarize this as a survey of Western music from the Middle Ages to 20th century.",
    "Yes, it was a great introduction to music-especially for someone with a limited background.",
    "An overview of classical music from the Medieval Ages to the present. Some mention of pop, world, and jazz music. The skills you pick up in this class will help you listen better to all types of music.",
    "An amazing class but far from a gut. Be prepared to do a moderate amount of work outside of class but ALOT of work prepping for the exams.",
    "If you want to learn about what's going on in music and what's important to know in the field of music, take this class. It's not unduly difficult but do not take it if you're looking for a real gut--you are expected to learn and understand material and do more than regurgitate it later. It's pretty enjoyable I think, and it really has broadened my musical knowledge and, most important, intensified my appreciation of music, which I already thought was considerable before I took this class!",
    "Music 112 is an entry level music course where you'll learn a lot about the different eras of music. During most of the semester, the class is very little work, but for the exams, you have to memorize a lot of vocabulary and be able to recognize a lot of pieces (name, composer, era) simply based on hearing snippets of them.",
    "I would recommend this class to another person. It was cool to be exposed to a new subject. Even though I like math and science more so than the humanities, I found this class interesting.",
    "This was a very fun class. Even if you do not like classical music, this course will teach you to appreciate it. It provides a good balance between learning about the fundamentals of music, the lives of various composers\/music history, and how music \"works\"--in other words, exploring why we like it, which is a fascinating topic. It also changed my mind on opera, which I did not like at all previous to this course.",
    "It was an enjoyable course. You learn a lot about music and music history. However, it's not as much of a gut as people think. There are a lot of assignments and exams are ridiculous. I wish I took it Credit D\/F.",
    "Take this course. It's not a gut, and sure isn't always easy, but it's definitely worth your time if you want a background in music history and need a HU credit.",
    "An enjoyable class that combines music appreciation, music theory, and music history all into one class. We get to hear a whole range of musical selections that will definitely expand your music library. Professor Wright is very knowledgable in this field and it is very cool to hear guest performers bring in their respective instruments and play for us! A great rest\/change from most classes - here you get to enjoy yourself while learning and figure out exactly why music makes you feel this way.",
    "A great intro lecture on the history of Western music, from middle age chants to renaissance madrigals, through classical works and operas till the modern and postmodern composers. It's a great way to learn about the \"important\" composers and musical styles. You'll actually learn that not all \"classical\" music is the same - you can actually tell what's from the 1700s and what was probably written in the 20th century. If you think that's valuable and want to go to lectures 2x a week about it, then sign up!",
    "Amazing course, not a complete gut though. The material is difficult for some. It's a very interesting course, and is definitely worth the time.",
    "This isn't a gut class. You will be asked to memorize lots of facts about music history\/musical genres. Lots of memorizing required for the midterm\/final. Less theory based and more fact based. Interesting for those looking to learn about music history. Not much about music post 1900.",
    "Great intro class to music history\/music. A fair amount of history, understanding different musical periods, and also lots of listening to music, which I really appreciated. Fun, no assignment mattered too much which was nice, the tests were very fair and required a normal amount of review...just found myself smiling in class all the time. Take it if you have the chance.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student; not a heavy courseload, and you will definitely gain a greater appreciation for music of all genres.",
    "I highly recommend the class. It taught me to understand and appreciate music in general and classical music especially. I am now literate in the basics of the Western canon, a pretty impressive accomplishment for one class.",
    "Definitely a great class. While very little of the class focuses on contemporary music, the knowledge and insights gained certainly open the world of classical music. The tools learned do even help you analyze contemporary music if your newfound love of the classical genre is not enough. Take this class before you leave Yale.",
    "Listening to Music is great. Fun lecture, relatively easy assignments. Keep in mind, however, that it is kind of difficult to get an A in this class because the grading is finicky. If I did it over I would take it c\/d\/f since I wasn't using it for any requirements. But aside from that I would highly recommend the class. It was great to learn the basics about Classical music and have some sense of the big names in composing and performance.",
    "DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!! The music is really relaxing to listen to and you actually learn a lot!! The professor is awesome and sincere. He is very easy-going. The listening exercises are fun but also make you think and learn. The exams are not gimmes so you need to study but studying is actually fun! Because you're just listening to music!",
    "MUSI 112 is a challenging and fun class to take. There is a lot of material to remember, but it is enlightnening to see how music has not only evolved over the years but how our tastes have been shaped by it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to whomever wishes to understand and appreciate classical music. No musical background is needed; they will try to train your ear, rather than expect it to already be in place. Yet this class, despite its extremely interesting subject matter, is no cake-walk. Serious studying is required for the mid-term and final. Day to day work is less than average, but don't take this class as a 5th class you expect to coast through.",
    "The class is a great intro to listening to music in a new way. I had no musical experience, and after taking this class, I feel like I know a lot more and can now understand many subtle aspects of the music that listen to that I would otherwise not have heard.Prof. Wright is passionate and very flexible as well. I definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "Take this class! It's fun, pretty easy, and a nice way to round out yourself as an educated person.",
    "Regardless of whether you know how to play an instrument or not, Music 112 helps all students alike gain an appreciation for the most noteworthy composers and pieces of Western music. This class definitely takes a lot of work and, given the weekly listening exercises and constant assignments throughout the term, requires a fair bit of effort. That said, I definitely came out of this class feeling more well-rounded.",
    "This is one of those classes that everyone should take before leaving Yale!! The course is inspiring - it is guaranteed to change your experience of listening to music. Beyond music, this class is truly part of a liberal arts education - of freeing yourself from whatever post-grad ambitions and career goals and worries you might have and instead learning something for the sheer pleasure of learning and digesting information about the elements of music and music history. I would highly, highly recommend this course to all Yalies and to anyone who can watch it online.",
    "I would recommend MUSI 112 if you are interested in learning about music history and the ways we perceive music. I definitely don't regret taking the class, but this is NOT A GUT. This class is a significant amount of work on par with my mechanical engineering required courses.",
    "I would recommend it for a student who has a background\/who has grown up listening to classical pieces..otherwise, if not, be ready to work pretty hard."
