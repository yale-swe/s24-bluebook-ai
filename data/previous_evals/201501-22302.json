    "Yes I would it's a good way to fulfill history department distributional credits and learn abotu a period of history that is rarely taught, but is actually quite relevant to our world.",
    "Hist 384J is a great class to take if you want to broaden your horizons and also work on your writing skills. It is a rich overview of a time and place that many of us know little about but that has had a lasting influence on the world as we know it today. The class is run well, and there is plenty of space for students to evaluate the material for themselves. Professor Allouche is extremely knowledgable and an invaluable resource for students who want to understand the Middle East, both in history and in our own time. As for writing, I would not hesitate to say that this class has made me better, both in short and long assignments, while still being a manageable commitment."
