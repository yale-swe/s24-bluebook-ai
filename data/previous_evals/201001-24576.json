    "YES. Past evaluations are good to read for this class\/professor. I agree with them.",
    "Our theme this year was \"Myth and Memory in Modern France\". Some days were really reading heavy, some days weren't at all, but it was always (theoretically) manageable. Grade is something like 10% participation, 15% a presentation (in powerpoint - pretty easy, just research on wikipedia, etc.), 20% first paper (4 pages, can redo it), 25% second paper (4 pages, can redo it), and 30% last paper (6 pages, no redo). Pinzka is also the French language writing tutor, so you can always hand it in to her earlier if you can, and she'll correct it in that capacity, then just hand it back in to be graded for real.All in all, written work is really light. Readings on the whole weren't fantastic, but she does a good job of propelling conversation, as long as you read a little bit of it. Subject matter was definitely interesting, learning about France's conception of myths of history.",
    "Would recommend - the readings can get kind of dry at times but Mme Pinzka is so sweet and the material is pretty interesting and comprehensive.",
    "Get ready to learn French History. It will come at you at a pretty quick pace, so stay on top of all of your readings. If you need any help, please talk to Professor Pinzka whenever you need anything or have any questions. You will be glad you did. I recommend the course for her, if for nothing else.",
    "Yes I strongly recommend this class. It was a great way to look at French history without the tiresome facts of a history class. It was interesting to look at history from a critical perspective, trying to understanding the myths that were created. The readings were interesting.",
    "It is probably THE BEST French course I have ever taken. Mme. Pinzka is not only wise beyond her area of study (literature) but she is also determined that her students learn how to argue effectively in French. I loved the theme of myth and memory, and would really recommend taking this course to any of the French history courses taught by the history department in English (if you have the appropriate French level, that is).",
    "No, I would not recommend French 172 to another student. Instead, I would simply point them towards French 170 Intro to French Lit, as the syllabus seems much more put together.",
    "This is a great course. Each year's theme is different but Prof. Pinzka is enthusiastic enough to always bring about a great classroom atmosphere. The reading may be quite heavy at times but the discussions are fun and the written workload is very light - just 3 papers.",
    "I think it's a really enjoyable class with interesting books and movies (some of the articles are less interesting and quite dense). I would say that if you are really looking to improve your French, then it is up to you to make the effort to participate fully in discussions. It's really not a hand-holding class, and you can \"get by\" easily. In order to do better than just \"getting by\" you have to really try to dominate discussions and do the readings. Otherwise, you might find yourself slacking off. Make sure you ask Mrs. Pinzka to proofread the essays ahead of time.",
    "French 172 is a good French class that enhances your French reading ability and to a lesser extent also your writing skills. Their is quite a lot of material, but its very manageable if you can read \"smartly\". The papers, depending on whether a topic sings to you or not, can be a bit of a hassle, but all in all, a recommendable course that gave me a better understanding of France's culture and (treatment of) history."
