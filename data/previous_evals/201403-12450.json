    "This class is more of the same as 110 and 120, learning grammar, translating things, etc. Turkish is the best.",
    "Turkish is a chill class where you learn some and enjoy some. It's not intense, so if you are looking for a serious commitment I would look elsewhere. There are a lot of resources for you to learn, but I think there are better language courses that you should invest in.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Turkish to any student. Turkish is a really interesting language to learn and the workload is very manageable. Etem is a really fun professor to have and he makes each class period fly by. If you need a language, you really must consider taking turkish.",
    "Yes, it is a fabulous course."
