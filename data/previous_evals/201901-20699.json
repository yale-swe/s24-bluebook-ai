   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very intense and hard problem sets but the professor was great.",
    "the sections were extremely helpful for the psets. pset 3 was way too long. I love Julien as a TF.",
    "This course is very well taught, balancing theory with heavy calculations. If you don't have experience with math\/calculus, this will probably be hard at first, but it gets easier.",
    "Strength of the course is that the slides are very comprehensive and conducive to learning all the material - weakness is that lectures are very confusing and Eva is very funny but often hard to understand, and she moves really quickly...I leave every lecture feeling like the material is super complicated, but then I read the slides and it seems very simple and I am left uneasy as to whether I am not studying something I should be etc.",
    "Eva has great lecture slides and is very thorough in her explanations and examples. However, she sometimes moves too fast.",
    "The course is taught very well- both by Eva and the TFs. It is well organized and expectations are communicated clearly. Lectures are clear. All of that being said, I think the actual content taught is really quite useless and boring. As much as Eva tries to connect it to the real world, it is outdated material and I question the existence of a course like this in the first place.",
    "The biggest weakness is that the learning is heavily focused on math rather than concepts. The majority of people in the course are taking it to develop an understanding of the concepts behind economics, not to practice calculus and algebra. Psets take hours not because they are teaching you difficult concepts, but because you have to carry out tons of math. Eva was a good professor, but the course itself felt pointless. It could be improved by dropping significant amounts of mathematics and focusing instead on understanding the concepts driving the equations. It honestly adds nothing to the course and takes away from time that could be spent developing an understanding of the topic.",
    "Pretty boring stuff generally.",
    "Strengths: 1. Professor really cares about the students!! and takes feedback well! 2. Lots of office hours 3. If you do your PSETs and understand most of it, you'll be fine in the course because the exams are PSET questions but easier. Don't be daunted by how hard the practice questions for the exams might be. 4. It's not the demon that people make it out to be. Weaknesses: 1. Can become a very competitive environment depending on who you hang out with 2. Abstract concepts 3. More math than actual economics--and I didn't always feel like I learned about *economics* as much as I did how to take a partial derivative",
    "Good course",
    "The course was incredibly organized, which I really appreciated. The course was also very well-taught and facilitated student learning. It could have been improved only with quicker responses to Piazza questions.",
    "Very organized, clear lecture slides",
    "Need to upload solutions to problem sets that are fully correct and re-upload if it is not. Solutions do not show the full process as to how answers are found.",
    "Something that would improve this course a lot would be review sessions of the material before finals. There is a lot of material covered, and for students who are not good at Economics or Math, the review sessions would be good to help understand concepts (instead of brute memorization, which is pointless for future uses).",
    "The main weakness of the course is the Professor. She often stumbled while explaining key concepts and spent more time explaining unnecessary things than covering materials relevant to assessments. Another weakness of the course was the amount of unnecessary time spent on homework assignments, specifically the podcast responses. It wasn't clear why we had to do these for our homework assignments. The strength of the course is the TA's. Most of the learning takes place in section as opposed to lecture. Another strength is the lecture slides, which to an extent compensate for the Professor's lecture style. Professor Chalioti has some of the most thorough lecture slides of any class I have taken so far.",
    "Very clear teaching, helpful TFs and sections, fair psets that matched the exams well.",
    "There should not be a curve in this class if it deflates student grades. I think it is demoralizing and encourages competition rather than collaboration. I also felt like a lot of the material is psets were not taught in class so it was necessary to attend office hours. People who have more free time will do better because some of the TAs basically give people answers, but if you dont have the time, then you are at a disadvantage. I feel like this is a corrupt model.",
    "Very straightforward course and it is well taught.",
    "Strengths: Overall not too difficult of a class. Some material is really interesting. Workload is not unreasonable and I enjoyed the mathematical focus of the class. Dr. Chalioti is a great professor. She's also super sweet and always willing to help. This made the class much stronger. This class is also very well organized. Weaknesses: The psets are TOO long and tedious. Everyone seems more interested in beating the curve than learning\/doing the best they can. Lastly, Dr. Chalioti starts off her lectures slowly but is going way too fast by the end. No one could keep up with the last 5 minutes of her lectures. This isn't a huge problem because slides are uploaded immediately after class.",
    "Strengths: Professor was pretty good, Eva Chalioti helped me learned so much! She taught the curriculum well and I learned lots! Weaknesses: the slides given and the psets and tests did not entirely match up. It seemed as though they assumed our intuition of economics was greater than what it actually is",
    "It teaches a lot of economic theory. However, it feels like after learning the initial idea of maximization, the rest of the course follows fairly naturally. The way the new material was presented was sometimes more confusing than it turned out to be.",
    "A weakness of the course was the great variability of problem set difficulty. Some were tediously long because of the complexity of the utility equations, while others were surprisingly short. It would have been nice to have consistently medium-length psets. A strength of the course was the straightforward nature of the exams. Especially the second midterm and the final seemed totally fair and seemed like good assessments of students' knowledge.",
    "This is moot -- you'll only take this if you have to. Way more math than necessary. Eva is the best teacher who teaches micro, but she still sucks at explaining things so that's just a reflection of the sad state of teaching in big econ lecture courses at Yale. Curve is unduly harsh (need almost-perfect scores to get an A). Is there really a difference between someone who missed four points for algebra mistakes and someone who didn't in terms of knowledge of microeconomics?",
    "I really really loved the lecture slides. I think they are easy to follow and offers just the right amount of material necessary to help us review for exams and also remain as concise as possible. I also liked having weekly problem sets, that albeit long, definitely helped us practice what we are taught in class. Allowing collaboration was also helpful, since it actually encourages me to discuss the problems with other people, and as a result trade ideas off each other in a way that is beneficial for everyone. I think the midterms were definitely fair, in the sense that they are similar to the problem sets, but always had an additional concept tied in in order to make it just challenging enough.",
    "Strengths: Professor Chalioti, most of the TFs, good slideshows. Weaknesses: classmates (people were really rude\/disengaged), mismatch between textbook and course (apparently there was a better textbook but this wasn't made clear until I had already bought the \"required\" textbook), lack of meaningful practice problems (mismatch between practice problems before exams and the exams). The problem sets were often short in terms of concepts practice but long in terms of wrangling with complicated numbers and set ups.",
    "Strengths: exams were very predictable, and you're given lots of review material Weaknesses: not the most engaging, just given how repetitive the material is. But that can't be changed",
    "This course did well by introducing the main tool early on and expanding on it very well",
    "Heavy derivatives of math. Liked the podcast.",
    "The course is a bit disorganized, however it is understandable given the size. My biggest issue with the course is the lack of review sessions and organized review material and practice exams.",
    "Make the course about teaching the intuition behind the fundamentals of micro, not just an applied calculus class.",
    "Strengths: learn the basics of economic modeling; given external readings and resources for deeper understanding for those that so desire Weaknesses: sometimes, there was a discrepancy between what was taught and what was tested",
    "Good use of the Lagrangian method to a wide range of problems. Psets helped to reinforce concepts. However, lectures often didn't help in solving pset or exam questions. Professor Chalioti isn't clear in her explanations, doesn't help to develop our intuition. A lot of the math is glossed over and we are left wondering why what we are doing works. Exams are set too easy and an exact replica of review problems. How are you going to test if students actually understand the material?",
    "The problem sets were hard despite being graded on effort. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from struggling to do them. I think the problem sets were my primary way of learning in this class though, the lectures were really good at explaining the concepts. My biggest problem with the class was intimidation. I was unable to perform well on the first exam because I was scared that I was unable to do the work. That change after I reviewed the questions I missed on my own and recognized that I was able to do them. I do think that intermediate mircoeconomics has a bad reputation for being extraordinarily hard which is why I was so scared during my first midterm exam. While it is a difficult class, it is definitely doable.",
    "Professor Chalioti does a great job of covering a wide expanse of material over the course of the semester by utilizing real-world examples and going through examples of the problems. The pace is quite fast; it is really useful to know the Lagrangian method before coming into the class. I had a hard time feeling engaged at times because it's such a large lecture class. Furthermore, some of the pset material does not reflect the material that we go over in class.",
    "Strengths: good lectures- very based in practice examples Weaknesses: practice material for exams should be more representative of the exams",
    "The professor and TFs were kind and clearly tried their best to offer help and support, but the required teachings for this class (and unclear textbook) made me feel as if I was suffocating.",
    "This course makes Yale look like a joke. I am an economics major, not an \"advanced algebra\" major. It only tests your algebra skills. Pathetic. This course should focus on the microeconomic concepts. I didn't learn any. Good thing I took intro. NOt the algebra.",
    "Lectures are very bad and incredibly hard to engage with. Section is where you really learn how to do the problem sets.",
    "The lectures are relatively engaging but they focus mostly on explaining mathematical concepts, proofs, and graphical appraoches to solving the set questions. Not that much time is spent actually discussing how these mathematical concepts can be applied to real-life economic scenarios. The sections are very helpful at providing tools to solve the pset and exam questions. Some of the topics and approaches are discussed only briefly or at surface-level in lecture. The psets help to better understand lecture material, and the weekly podcasts add a bit of real-life context for the generally mathematical focus of the class.",
    "The highlight of the course was the real world applications. Sometimes the math was overwhelming and there was a lot of theory to digest at once, but reviewing the concepts in terms of current events through discussing excerpts from the news\/podcasts\/etc really helped my understanding of the course material",
    "strengths: taught extremely well, doing practice problems during class when teaching the topic area for the first time, posting practice notes before exams, productive and helpful TF office hours, straight-forward and not trying to trick you",
    "The lectures are clearly outlined, and office hours are always announced clearly.",
    "Strengths: No real surprises on exams and they are graded fairly, section seems fine and there is plenty of practice material, professor Chalioti actually takes feedback and is willing to work with students Weaknesses: The curve was always insane, especially since they made the second exam too easy, another slight weakness is that the class material is not so diverse (basically just Lagrangians all day)",
    "Lectures were often hard to understand and not well explained. Sometimes slides were clicked through simply to get to the end of the lecture, if we were running out of time",
    "Strengths: a lot of resources to do well",
    "strengths lie in interesting sections and great review during lecture while weaknesses lie in psets being exponentially harder than what is presented in class",
    "Strengths were the sections. Slides could include more information.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is that the TA's can really teach students the material during section. To be honest, most of my learning happened during section. I think this course could be improved by focusing mostly on the types of problems and running through more clear examples during lecture, as if it were a section.",
    "Professor is good, but class often felt like a waste of time because you could learn the same amount by just reviewing the lecture slides she posts.",
    "Professor Chalioti is an excellent professor and a great lecturer. I enjoyed her lectures. However, the material was extremely difficult, especially with regards to the level of math. The prerequisite for this course was a math course level 112 to 120. There is a great difference between having taken 112 and 120. I was not prepared for the calculus involved in this course having taken math 112.",
    "I think the pacing is pretty good but the lectures arent very helpful. I learned mostly through section",
    "An emphasis on public policy debates is needed. A more detailed explanation of welfare theories.",
    "Straightforward and thorough.",
    "One strength was that Professor Chalioti tried to emphasize many of the real world applications of the topics we were studying, which was an aspect of the course that wasn't really covered much in Intro Micro. Perhaps it would have been nice to have access to previous exams while studying for midterms and the final.",
    "Overall, a very good course. Lectures could have been slightly more engaging but overall great.",
    "This course was fine but a little tedious. Some of the psets were excessively long, but overall the coursework was manageable. Some of the concepts are simpler than the slides make them out to be, so clarity of instruction could be improved.",
    "Tests were way too easy, making the curve really brutal for people who understood the material but made a small mistake.",
    "The lectures for this course are very good and the study material available is great as well.",
    "Good lectures",
    "The concepts could be better explained and the syllabus better organized. It was honestly hard to follow what was happening in lecture. I would say Eva and the TAs are probably the strengths of the class.",
    "This course is very well-organized and therefore, relatively easy to follow, although the content can be challenging at times.",
    "Many strengths",
    "This course is well structured and the material is explained well. I also like that the problem sets are based on effort. The disadvantage is that the class is too big and finding the correct resources can be difficult. Additionally, more concrete examples of problems can be done during lecture.",
    "The lectures and slides were very good and helpful. The sections could be improved because I felt like we went through topics too quickly.",
    "It felt like there was very little standardization of what concepts we were expected to know and how to approach these concepts. Additionally the course did a bad job of putting each concept in its context and relating concepts in a clear way.",
    "Really excellent overall. Julian and Professor Chalioti were both very strong at explaining some tough material, and managed to be personable and kind as well. Also, the materials provided to help us study were thorough and useful. One change I'd like to see is more explanation of the limitations of the models we study. Economics is not (by any measure) an exact science, so it would be useful to cover how some of these ideas are used in the real world and how they fail and succeed.",
    "The course has a reasonable flow and is reasonably well-structured. Everyone in the course was helpful and took notice of how students in general performed to adjust for the tests. However, there are times when problem sets or practice materials are significantly harder than what is taught in class, which rendered a lot of people worried more than necessary. I do think that the topics covered are reasonable in breadth and depth; maybe some more easy-to-understand practice materials can help.",
    "Strengths: Great variety of topics, very interesting Weaknesses: \"Front\" heavy, in that the hardest topics were introduced first I feel. Perhaps this was necessary though.",
    "Professor Chalioti did a fantastic job of making sure that the material was accessible and made sure to start each class with an application of the concept we were learning that day. She also included podcasts on each of our problem sets, which I really enjoyed because it helped make the class feel like an economics class rather than plug-and-chug math class. It could be improved by having more standardized p-sets, p-sets that utilize real numbers rather than variables, and exams that look more like the p-sets (or vice versa).",
    "I wish we had done producer theory right after consumer theory and then moved into welfare, taxes, insurance, etc. That was my only qualm.",
    "Strengths: (1) Professor Chalioti. She's just amazing and seems to actually care about her students and how the course is run. Her attitude every day during class made a real difference in my overall experience of this course. (2) The podcasts. These were kind of a pain in the butt to listen to every week, but I really did learn a lot! They were super interesting and I'm glad that they were a part of the assignments (3) Well-organized and fair exams that actually test the topics covered in class. (4) Plenty of office hours that were scheduled throughout the week. Made it possible to accommodate really busy schedules. (5) Quick turnaround on grading psets and exams Weaknesses: (1) The practice material posted was much appreciated, but the topics covered there tended to be much more complex than the ones tested normally. So perhaps just adding a practice material page with more straightforward problems in addition to the more complex sheet. I think both would be helpful in their own way. (2) The pset numbering and lettering. Would be really great to standardize that. The current system was pretty confusing. (3) My friend says that there's an easier way to optimize with constraints instead of doing Lagrange? I don't 100% remember what his method was. He learned it from taking Econometrics though. Would be great to standardize best practice methods across these courses. I'm sure more than one topic overlaps as well, so maybe there's an opportunity there to cooperate on more things as well. Overall, minor weaknesses. Definitely a well-organized and well-run course.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Eva. She is such a kind, lovely woman-- I really wish I didn't dislike her subject so much. At times, I found myself wishing that she would teach material at a slower rate or without unnecessary math. For example, to this day, I don't understand the point of learning Slutsky. Furthermore, I don't understand the point of testing us on Slutsky since I cannot imagine a time when I will be required to Slutsky a real-life scenario without the help of a calculator or the Internet. Also, problem sets were way, way too hard and time-consuming. I am not kidding when I say that I spent a good 15 hours working on one of our problem sets. It's nice that they're graded on effort, though. Also, didn't like how we didn't get comments on our PSets.",
    "The course is a standard lecture. Chalioti is a clear and thorough lecturer, and you learn the skills advertised.",
    "The course provides a slightly more nuanced look at microeconomics since the models we used were more complex compared to introductory microeconomics. However, the course really didn't focus on economics and felt more like a mathematics course applied to economics.",
    "Sometimes the lectures were hard to follow, as we rarely did examples from beginning to end. However, I found section extremely helpful for this, so there was a balance.",
    "Professor is great just hard to be taught in a lecture setting. Seminar would be so much better.",
    "This is a terrible course. The professor was difficult to understand due to her style and her poor handwriting. Classes lacked cohesion, and seemed more like random math concepts than an overview of economics.",
    "This class was fun and simple. It did not give too much work most of the time. They should tell us though why we lose points on our homework because they would not give us any clue."

    "If you can take this class and do above average in it, you can do anything in life. This class was the hardest class I have ever taken in my life. This class is the price they make you pay for trying to be an ECON major at Yale University. Everything is earned in this class. I am just glad I got through it.",
    "Absolutely recommend taking this course with Prof Chalioti. Extremely well organized and straight forward.",
    "gotta take it for econ",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. It has more practical economics concepts than some of the intro classes, and it gives you a lot of important math skills for optimization. If you have to take it for the major, TAKE IT WITH EVA. The problem sets are graded based on effort, and the exams are super fair (no surprises). The econ curve (50% A A-) is also great.",
    "You're probably only taking if you have to, but honestly it was better than it could have been for a dry quantitative requirement. Ended up being quite fun, and while the psets were hard, they were useful. A little weird that Eva seemed to want to keep the grade distribution a secret for the entirety of the class.",
    "I would only recommend this course to economics majors.",
    "I would not straight up recommend this course. If you do have to take it for a requirement, I would take it with Eva because she organizes it really well and makes it as manageable as it can be. I would hope it is not a major requirement\/ updated in the future to be more in line with how economics works today.",
    "You're only taking it because you have to, so good luck.",
    "Not really unless for your major. The math is super basic (people always complain about it and it's literally MATH 112-level calculus). Just generally pretty boring.",
    "It is a lot of work, so I would only recommend taking this course if you're an economics major.",
    "You'll take it for your major, most likely. If you just want a QR or SO credit, this isn't the course for it, unless you really want to learn a specific method of doing specific economic things. It's not really good for getting an understanding of economics per se (not as much as intro micro or macro), and if you want to learn more about calculus, the actual calculus courses will give you more depth. But, if you need to take it for your major, it's a well-taught course! Strengths: 1. Professor really cares about the students!! and takes feedback well! 2. Lots of office hours 3. If you do your PSETs and understand most of it, you'll be fine in the course because the exams are PSET questions but easier. Don't be daunted by how hard the practice questions for the exams might be. 4. It's not the demon that people make it out to be. Weaknesses: 1. Can become a very competitive environment depending on who you hang out with 2. Abstract concepts 3. More math than actual economics--and I didn't always feel like I learned about *economics* as much as I did how to take a partial derivative",
    "More office hrs and to give the tutors the answers",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is genuinely interested in microeconomics and micro theory. I would not recommend this course to a student who is unwilling to commit to giving the material and assignments the time they deserve.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I thought that the material was actually very interesting. I would warn that you should be very comfortable with calculus, as this class is basically a math-based class about economics. Many students take it for their major.",
    "Yes if you are an econ major, otherwise not really",
    "Only if you're a Global Affairs, EP&E or Economics major, in which case you have to take it. If you're serious about trying to get an A in this course, it depends solely on the exams, as everyone receives nearly perfect scores on homework because they are graded on effort. If you want to receive high grades on the exams, scrutinize the practice materials that the Prof. hands out before the exam. The exams EXACTLY follow the practice materials and homework; no surprises.",
    "Yes. Professor Chalioti is absolutely wonderful. Curve can be harsh though.",
    "Only take this class if you need to to fulfill a prerequisite.",
    "Yes if you need it for your major.",
    "Honestly not nearly as scary as people make this class out to be. Yes the psets are long, but theyre not exceptionally difficult. Prof Chalioti was great!",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who is interested in Econ\/needs to take it. This class is not nearly as hard as people make it out to be so don't be afraid to take it. The psets are long (and unnecessarily tedious at times) but the class as a whole is not too hard or time consuming. The tests are also straightforward and similar to the psets. Dr. Chalioti is amazing and made this class even better. Would definitely take, and DONT let people convince you this class is hard. It's definitely reasonable.",
    "YES totally! Spring Semester Professor Eva Chalioti was AMAZING! She taught the content very well, although she missed a few things that I didn't know how to do on the PSets and stuff (but that's what office hours are for)",
    "Not sure. I would maybe go for econ theory if I did it again. Felt like the difficult part of the class was being fast and not intellectual challenge. But that could just be a bias of what I prefer -- as a math major, I tend to like\/do better in harder classes where the difficult part is to understand it conceptually. In other words, where time isn't an issue, but the grappling with the ideas is the difficult part of the class.",
    "I assume you only are taking this course because it's required, and that's the only reason I think people should take it. It's certainly not a bad class, and you can enjoy the material to an extent, but there's no reason to take this for fun. It's a simple nuts and bolts economics class.",
    "This is moot -- you'll only take this if you have to. Way more math than necessary. Eva is the best teacher who teaches micro, but she still sucks at explaining things so that's just a reflection of the sad state of teaching in big econ lecture courses at Yale. Curve is unduly harsh (need almost-perfect scores to get an A). Is there really a difference between someone who missed four points for algebra mistakes and someone who didn't in terms of knowledge of microeconomics?",
    "Yes, this is definitely a fun course even for non-econ majors. However, just make sure that you really master the Lagrange optimization technique that is introduced in the beginning of the course, since this technique will serve as a base foundation of everything else done in the course.",
    "Professor Chalioti teaches the course well, so, if you have to take intermediate micro, I would take it with her. If you don't have to take intermediate micro, I'm not sure that I would -- I had hoped it would help me evaluate the economic system more effectively, which it didn't.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs it as a requirement for the major. Definitely take the course with Eva - her exams were super straight forward, and she makes lectures enjoyable",
    "Yes, this is a great course to follow intro micro.",
    "Yes, midterms are manageable. Just watch out for the final, itll get ya.",
    "Yes, interesting micro.",
    "I would recommend the class, I think it teaches a lot of interesting topics and the professor really cares about students and the material.\/.",
    "If you're in the major and have a handle on calc, you'll be fine. The class is well-organized even though the material itself is rather dull and irrelevant to real-world skills. If you don't need to take it as a requirement, though, there are more interesting courses.",
    "Yes. Even if it's not a requirement, it gives you insight into economic modeling and human\/market behavior. Major concepts you'll learn include: optimization with the Lagrange multiplier, the Slutsky Equation, Marshallian vs Hicksian demand, leisure and labor supply, uncertainty and risk, Pareto efficiency, Edgeworth Box, Walrasian equilibrium, and market structure and profit maximization. Googling some of these terms beforehand will help you understand what you're getting yourself into.",
    "If you have to take it for your major its not bad. Otherwise, I dont think its the most practical class ever unless you keep going in Econ.",
    "Yes, as a technical and quantitative approach to economics",
    "No, not unless you absolutely have to take it. And even then, proceed with caution.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT WITH EVA!!! EVA IS INCREDIBLE!!! I LOVE EVA",
    "While I very much enjoyed this course, I recognize that only people who are interested in Econ should take this class. I would recommend it to those who enjoy studying econ, but not many students outside of that field.",
    "Yes. Although its probably a required class for you, the subject material is actually very interesting. You learn the intuition and foundation of how economists model behavior as well as production by firms. While there is, of course, substantial math, Eva takes the time to go through the basic problems in class and then allows you to expand this knowledge onto the problem sets assigned each week.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the more mathematical aspect of microeconomics. However, I did feel like the class lost sight of the more economics side of things, as all the problems are pretty math-y.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Econ major. Chalioti is a very reasonable professor and her exams are reflective of what is taught in lecture.",
    "No!",
    "If u have to take it u have to take it. It's pretty easy Idk why people say it's hard. But remember: know ur algebra",
    "Only take it if you have to. It's not a fun course.",
    "I would recommend this class to students that enjoy math but not to non-majors who are looking for an interesting Econ class.",
    "If they have to take it for their major. Otherwise, it can be a lot of work just do take for fun and the material can be more challenging than most other classes.",
    "Yes if it is relevant to their major",
    "Yes, the material is very interesting, and the course follows a certain structure that is easy to understand.",
    "Well if you need it for your major, then of course take the class. If you just want to know more about economics, then you probably don't want to take this class in particular -- it is pretty much just a math class with econ flavoring.",
    "If youre not an Econ major then no",
    "Yes, if looking to major in economics",
    "Take it if you're trying to take higher level Econ classes and if you need it for your major, but other than that, it's not really a class \"for fun.\"",
    "yes as it allowed greater application of economic concepts to real world",
    "It is required but yes",
    "Yes, you generally have to take it but its really not that hars",
    "Yes, if you are need it for your major. If not, I dont it being too applicable or necessary.",
    "Chances are, you have to take it anyways for the Econ\/EPE\/Global Affairs major. I came into the class hearing that it was one of the toughest courses, and while there were certain parts of the course that were challenging, Professor Chalioti made sure to teach the lectures and review sessions at a pace that was very manageable and reasonable. A few of the problem sets are quite tedious, but they will pay off in the long run by preparing you well for the range of questions you might encounter on exams",
    "I would recommend this class to another student but probably only if they have to take it. A little too complex and inapplicable to other fields if you're just taking it for fun.",
    "I would only recommend this course to people who have to take it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student that has a strong background in multi variable calculus because the class is heavily based around partial derivatives.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, its taught very well.",
    "No",
    "Dont take it unless you have to (which you know anyway). This class will be incredibly easy for anyone with a math and calculus backgroundeveryone else will spend more time doing math than actually worrying about Econ, which is a shame! In terms of the actual economics, its unfortunate that you dont learn anything more conceptually than you do in intro micro, you just learn the math behind it.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it covers a lot of material in a structured, comprehensible manner.",
    "Yes for sure",
    "If you have to take it for your major, definitely take it with prof Chalioti. She is super nice and fair and has very reasonable expectations.",
    "Yes, I would, specifically for someone interested in firm and consumer directed economics, but not to someone looking for just a QR credit, the individual would have to genuinely be interested in microeconomics",
    "If you need to take it, take it. Its not he most engaging or well-organized economics class for people only looking for an interesting economics class.",
    "Yes! This course gets a bad rep because a lot of people are forced to take it for their majors. I actually found it really interesting and fun. The psets were graded on effort, which really helped facilitate learning, and the sections, office hours, and review sessions were genuinely useful. Obviously it's quite math-based, so if you struggle with algebra or differential calculus you may have issues. But overall a pretty cool class.",
    "Yes, especially with Professor Chalioti.",
    "Yes - a great professor and very interesting content!",
    "I enjoyed learning about microeconomics. This course was EXTREMELY challenging. My advice to other students is to credit\/D the class if you are able to. I would not recommend this course \"for fun\".",
    "Yes! I know this is pre-req for a lot of students (it was for me), but I actually ended up enjoying this course more than I thought I would. Professor Chalioti was a really pleasant surprise. She seems to actually care about her students and puts in effort to make the course relevant and interesting. Microeconomics in general isn't always the best, but this course is really well-organized and well-run. If you've got to take it, take it with Professor Chalioti. It wasn't all rainbows and sprinkles. The psets tended to be long and twisty. There might be only 3 questions, but each question had a-g. Highly recommend taking this with a friend or group of friends so that you can go over psets with them. I really had to put in time to study and comprehend the material as well. And definitely know that if you screw up submitting a pset online, Professor Chalioti will not work with you to resubmit no matter the circumstances. Check and then double check every submission because psets matter in a class with a curve this tight.",
    "Only take it if you need it.",
    "Yes, if you need it.",
    "I'm indifferent between recommending and not recommending this course to another student. One one hand, the course taught me more about microeconomics in depth and caused me to think about some of my own day to day actions. On the other hand, students didn't really need to understand economics to do well in the course. Everything was math based and conceptual test questions were in short supply.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as I did learn a lot.",
    "Yes it was interesting but maybe a good credit D if not required.",
    "Definitely not. The only reason you should take this course is as a requirement, which is probably the only reason anyone takes the course right now",
    "Yes, it's chill if you're good at Math.",
    "If you need to take it, you need to take it. Otherwise...no."
