   "comments": [
    "I learned about chemical reactions in water bodies, and gained insights on the importance of adequate scientific knowledge in management of water resources to ensure public health and safety. It also served as a great review of chemistry for me.",
    "I learned quite a bit about how to quantify various chemical characteristics of natural waters. Many of the concepts were familiar but I had only explored in laboratory settings where the variables can be isolated and controlled. This was more like systems chemistry and I really enjoyed the subject matter on metals, solids and geology in general. Also, I think the discussion on flint was some of the most engaging material on redox chemistry I've ever covered.",
    "1) Water Systems in the natural world. 2) Learnt so much more about Aquatic Chemistry 3) Most interesting course for me of the ones i took this semester.",
    "The course began with a useful review of some chemistry reaction basics. The course progressed logically, with segments building off each other, to look at methods to solve for the pH of water or the concentration of a species in a variety of conditions. We learned about redox chemistry, acid-base chemistry, complexation, dissolution and precipitation. Also looked at thermodynamics. The course principally taught water chemistry problem solving, so that given a fixed set of information and a variety of methods and formulas, you can solve for the missing piece. Learned approaches to make assumptions to make problems more tractable."

   "comments": [
    "One session dedicated to a general chemistry review might be helpful for people who have not had chemistry in a long time. No complaints here though as Desiree was quite effective in walking us through the relevant concepts throughout the course.",
    "This class covers a lot of material. I was very satisfied with it the way it was taught. I do, however, think that the amount of math taught was disproportionate to what a student can be expected to take away with them and recall later. I think it was perfectly acceptable during the course and very manageable but I probably wouldn't be able to remember these equations after six months without the book and a lot of time. What I mean to say is that the material that was taught was taught excellently. I personally retain material better in the long run with more discussion that anchors meaning of the math. This probably isn't true for all students but if someone were to design the course for my learning style we would do more discussions like flint. Then couple them with more complex problem sets which we could solve with software to simplify the calculation time, and finally produce some written content discussing the results their implications.",
    "1) I think this course is very important to understand the the way water systems respond to chemical changes. 2) It is definitely very important for people who are in water research or in future will want to become water engineers.",
    "Strengths: -Classes very well organized -Notes all written on board, included all the information you need to solve homework problems (more engaging than powerpoint) -Instructor very knowledgable Weaknesses: -ChemEQL software program somewhat difficult to use Improvement: -If possible, bring in real-life examples \/ case studies more often for class or homework; Flint MI example was especially engaging"

    "Yes, this is a good course for anyone wishing to conduct water quality related research.",
    "I thought the course was very interesting and the work was challenging but the workload was very fair. I wish I'd had more time to do more reading on the material outside of what was expected in class.",
    "Absolutely 100%.",
    "Yes! If student is interested in water chemistry, they will gain a thorough grounding in the subject."
