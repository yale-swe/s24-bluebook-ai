   "comments": [
    "International Democratization is a great survey of a number of theories of democratization, and looks at a plethora of interesting examples around the world, including Easter Europe after the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the Arab Spring. The readings were very though-provoking and Marinov was a great professor. Take it!",
    "This is a great way to learn about global affairs. Marinov is a brilliant professor, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "I'd recommend the class to students who are willing to do a lot of reading and who are interested in democracy. Students also should have a basic knowledge of current events in international relations. They need to be willing to speak up in class.I would not recommend this course to a student interested in the theory behind (rather than practice of) democracy. This class is driven by historical examples, and if the student doesn't like history, then he\/ she may notenjoy this class.",
    "It's a class on the variables that influence democracy. We also study the external factors that might affect the emergence or consolidation of democracy in the developing world. It's an interesting course. I think the students and teacher made the course not that great though...",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in the question of how the international community can best promote democracy in transitioning nations.",
    "Yes. Important material, quite thoroughly covered. Loads of long readings though. And the focus is really on Eastern Europe and the Arab Spring, with some material on Latin America--definitely less focus on Africa or Asia.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this to another student. The class centers around 2 hour long discussions that, once you become involved in, seem way too short. Discussing political theory with other brilliant students in a small classroom setting makes you learn a great deal on the subject. Professor Marinov is a fantastic professor who fostered discussions and made us think in very different ways. The class is very reading heavy (about 200 pages of long political papers a week) and thus, if you don;t have time to do most of the readings, I'm not sure if I would suggest it. The readings are extremely interesting though and if you put the time into doing them you will really enjoy the class. The work is manageable, most of the grade focuses on themidterm and final. Professor Marinov is an extremely fair grader so if you put effort into your exams you will get a very good grade. The only qualm I have is that the final was 12 hours long (take home essays that must be done in one sitting) and was pretty daunting. Other than that, one of the best classes I took",
    "If you're interested in understanding how international forces can lead to the democratization of countries, by all means, take this class. I would say, however, that it would be best if you had some outside knowledge about regime transitions - particularly for the latter half of the course, which focuses on the Arab Spring countries. Prof. Marinov is very approachable, but class discussions are essentially run entirely by the students, so your classmates will determine how much you get out of the course. This year, there were two take home essays with time limits. Make sure that you keep up with the readings, as class time is devoted to reviewing them.",
    "Not going to be offered again by Marinov, but the reading list is great so if it's offered under another professor, take it.",
    "It is a great class and you should by all means take it! Prof. Marinov offers a great overview of all aspects of international democratization. The workload is similar to that of other seminars at Yale. We had a take-home midterm, a take-home final, two assignments (the first one was individual, the second one we did in groups), and a lot of reading. All assigned readings were presented in class by one of the students.",
    "Definitely. Reasonable amount of work, important subject material, engaging but not stressful. This course is what you make of it, and if you do the readings, they're really interesting and help you make substantial contributions to the discussion and your own understanding of democracy promotion abroad. If you just sit by and listen, you'll be wasting the experience, but still learn a lot from Marinov and the class discussions.",
    "I would whole heartedly recommend the class to a fellow student. It covers a broad spectrum of matters related to democracy. If you want to study the theoretical aspects of how democracy works and how it spreads then take this class. Discussion was never dry in class and we usually incorporated current happenings in the world into our discussion. Professor Marinov was very well versed in the subject that it was always a pleasure to take part in the discussions. Also, he is kind and helpful and would make sure to assist you with any questions you have regarding the topic. The work load is pretty standard for a seminar- weekly readings, participation, two assignments, a take home mid-term and a take-home final. I absolutely enjoyed going to class. Take it if you can get in."
