   "comments": [
    "English 115 is an awesome class because it allows you to work on improving your writing while reading some incredible works of literature that may be ignored by other instructors. The discussions are always interesting because the material that's assigned as reading is not boring, but rather, quite intriguing. It's a class that makes you look at intimacy in so many ways besides the predominant view involving a romantic relationship between two people. I thoroughly enjoyed this literature seminar and I recommend it to students who want to improve their writing while working on literary criticism.",
    "The readings and discussions were very enjoyable. Natalie Prizel is a great instructor. She was very passionate about the topics (and anything to do with the Victorian period).",
    "Would definitely recommend this course, good introduction to college-level English.",
    "As a freshman, I thought \"Strange Intimacies\" was a wonderful introduction to the English department at Yale. The class was not at all intimidating and the workload was very manageable. The reading list was interesting and varied, and class discussions were always accessible. If you're a little nervous about your writing skills coming into Yale, this is a great first English class to take.",
    "An introductory course to analytical writing. It's a very good class if you want to perfect your analytical writing.",
    "I think this is a good course for improving writing skills. The workload is not too demanding, and the readings are interesting. Of course, you need to put in the effort and work necessary in order for your essays to improve.",
    "Take this course. Incredibly interesting reads, and the papers are NOT stressful in any sense of the word.",
    "In English 115, You will do a lot of reading (for me, a non-humanities major), sometimes in unnecessarily elevated language, but the texts are interesting and You can usually decipher what the critics are attempting to argue and it'll be discussed in class if You're not 100%. I feel that the gradin is fair and You learn about writing, but You should come in knowing the basics of writing a paper.",
    "Intro English course, so it has its ups and downs. It's definitely relaxing during class. Just do your readings and know what you're talking about. Don't approach the class in a competitive manner because you'll be the person who ruins it. It's a class where you can freely state your opinion without judgement. Definitely recommend. Just be prepared to work on those papers. Grading varies.",
    "Reading texts, class discussions, and papers. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to improve writing skills and interested in literature.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. If you're planning on writing lots of academic papers--which you probably are--115 is the way to go. I learned how to incorporate and engage with literary criticism in my essays, and they keep you writing at a fairly constant pace without the relentless paper-a-week of 120 or 114. This could've just been my section, but the class discussion was open, fascinating, and even funny at times. This was hands down the best writing class I've ever taken, and my writing skills have improved my essays in all of my other classes as well. Do this, and if you can, do it with Natalie Prizel! Amazing professor.",
    "English 115 is a challenging but manageable introductory english course that focuses on various topics in literature and analyzing and arguing different aspects of the literature in four essays over the course of the semester. I would recommend this class because its workload is manageable, the class was small and the classes were enjoyable because of the discussions we had."
