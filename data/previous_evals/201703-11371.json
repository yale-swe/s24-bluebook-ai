   "comments": [
    "Learned about the history of global development efforts.",
    "The inter-connectedness of problems related to and emanating from poverty. And the insight that poverty itself had to be problematized and conceived of as an issue.",
    "This is a good class for an overview of the evlolution of international development and poverty alleviation initiatives from 1950s until now.",
    "This class gave me a broad understanding of some global poverty relief efforts spearheaded by the United States beginning during the Cold War and into the present. It helped students develop the research and writing skills that are expected to be through seminars. In addition to that, I think it helped me become more critical of charitable efforts and poverty relief efforts, both in the past and current. It allowed us to see how they have unintended consequences, how they are often used as justification for self-interested goals, and how they are often misrepresented in history.",
    "Primary source analysis, critical evaluation of assumptions",
    "I gained knowledge on the history and unintended consequences of movements in international development and poverty alleviation from the 1960s to the present . I also learned how to analyze how the approaches of current development organizations and how they were influenced by this history.",
    "The course provided an overview of the history of the development movement through the 20th century. We had a chance to look at a variety of sources, from novels to project evaluations to secondary sources on policy programs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting topic, readings are interesting and workload isn't too heavy. Weaknesses: Can feel repetitive at times.",
    "Wonderful professor, large range of academic interests among students.",
    "I loved the syllabus! Professor Meyerowitz picks really interesting readings, and she is a very engaging professor. I liked that she began each class with highlights of the reading for the week. I also really liked the group of students Professor Meyerowitz put together. We consistently had interesting discussions. In addition, she gave us useful feedback on the assignments we submitted. I wish there were less research assignments though. I think having research assignments four times a semester instead of every week would have been good. Other than that, I really enjoyed the class!",
    "I think this class was very well structured - with a doable amount of readings for each week and discussion centered around those readings. I think the fact that it was discussion-based, with the discussion very much directed was great! It kept students engaged while also steering them to some conclusions they did not always come to. I liked how it was organized both chronologically and thematically. That allowed for a general understanding of thoughts on the topic during a specific time and a more nuanced understanding of one particular writer or a particular organization.",
    "This course was highly engaging, with some of the best class discussions I've encountered.",
    "The readings were very diverse and challenging, representing experts in fields varying from women's studies to economics. I thought a large strength of the course was this range of primary and secondary sources we read, which allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the history of movements in international development and poverty alleviation. I thought the research assignments and class discussions that Professor Meyerowitz arranged also complemented these readings very well. I also enjoyed working on the term paper throughout the second half of the semester and appreciated the peer feedback. The only suggestion I would give is to have more specific feedback and instructions for the short papers. It was a bit difficult to figure out what we were supposed to write.",
    "The course workload was quite balanced for a history seminar, which I definitely appreciated. Prof. Meyerowitz distributes the papers you write, which can make the work easier to manage as it often falls in between the midterm wave of work. The readings were interesting for the most part, and discussion was extra interesting because of the variety of majors\/backgrounds represented - history majors were not the obvious majority."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in historical approaches to global development efforts then definitely. Also if you are looking for an easy junior history seminar this is a good choice. The reading load is light compared to other seminars and the assignments are just 2 4-page reading responses and a 15-page final paper.",
    "I absolutely loved Prof. Meyerowitz. She was the first professor I've had at Yale who I feel was a really good teacher, and not just some expert who teaches on the side. Her mini-lectures at the beginning of the class helped situate the material. After anyone would make a comment, she would rephrase their most salient points, so that we got a sense of what was right\/wrong. Usually Professors at Yale either nod to everything everyone says (so you have no sense of what's right\/wrong), or they pick out the wrong parts of people's comments, which can be demoralizing\/intimidating. She would also relate people's comments, which was nice because it made the discussion more coherent. That being said, I didn't find the material all that engaging. If you read a few books on development history, you can learn all that you'd get from the class, but without wasting a credit. I think one way to make this more engaging is to include more successful examples of poverty alleviation. We only talked about what was wrong with development. It's much simpler to pick something apart than it is to defend the merits of something controversial. It would also make for more interesting class debate, because for the most part everyone was just agreeing with each other that development efforts are imperialistic\/informed by Western values.",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is a good class for students who have a development background and for those who are new to the field. It is a great way to understand the overarching themes in development post-1950.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I think I left it a little hopeless - it made it seem like there was no solution that was not self-interested on the part of the U.S. and ineffective, if not destructive. But another way of looking at that is that I have become more critical, which I think is important.",
    "Absolutely! Every single Global Affairs major should be required to take this course.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who's interested in the area of developmental studies from a more historical point of view, understanding the origins and foibles of prevailing developmental theories.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in international or nonprofit work, and especially anyone interested in international development. Studying these topics through a historical lens provided a context for today's work that many other classes at Yale fail to offer. The readings were interesting and the discussions were challenging-- definitely a class worth taking.",
    "Take it if you would like an interdisciplinary look into the history of development in the 20th century! Prof. Meyerowitz is also a great professor who's very proactive in the classroom."
