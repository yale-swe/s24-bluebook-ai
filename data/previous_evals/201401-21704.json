    "I took this class as a refresher for E and M. I found it a little too easy up until the midterm, but it quickly increased in difficulty after that. The final project format was very nice. Prof. Rakich is great! I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "This class gives you a much more in-depth view of electromagnetism than you would get in a regular physics class. The textbook is excellent, and I thought Professor Rakich did a very good job teaching, especially since it was his first class he has taught. He was very considerate of students. I recommend this course--it sparked my curiousity in the topic, so I feel like I got a lot out of it.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class with Professor Rakich. I signed up based on the strength of Michel Devoret's reviews and the extremely cool syllabus of transmission lines, waveguides, radiation, etc. Instead, we spent the first half of the semester doing Phys 181 topics and rushed through transmission lines in the last week. To more precise: out of the 12 week syllabus, we properly learned 6 weeks and got a decidedly un-rigorous smattering of topics from the last 6 weeks in the last week of lecture. On the bright side, it was a very easy class with little work. Problem sets and midterm were easy, and we had final presentations instead of a final exam. This was Professor Rakich's first time teaching, so I'm confident that his future classes will be better, but I would wait a year or two if possible.",
    "This is E and M applied. We had a total of seven problem sets instead of the estimated 9 in the syllabus. Problem sets are worth 60% while the midterm and the final presentation each count 20%. So the problem sets were the biggest portion but they were each worth about 8.5% Each of the problems are covered in class and are also explained in more detail in Griffiths and the readings provided by Professor Rakich, who is also available through office hours along with Zlatko and very accessible for any questions via email. The material is challenging. At least be familiar with multivariable calculus.",
    "If you have taken PHYS260\/261, you have learned most of what you will learn in this class. It is an incredibly easy class compared to the other rigorous physics courses. I would even say it is comparable to AP Physics. You will learn about some interesting EM applications, but mostly, you'll just re-learn EM. It's unfortunate that the physics major has an EM requirement that can be fulfilled with so few interesting classes, but this is definitely less of a headache than PHYS 430."
