   "comments": [
    "A particularly good survey of recent Latin American history. Take this if you have any interest in the region.",
    "A solid overview of Latin American history and a good baseline for further study on the topic. Starts off a bit dry, but gets much more interesting as the semester progresses. The readings were excellent, and they really allow students to weigh in on historiographical debates.",
    "Good class if you are interested in the material.",
    "A very broad, thematic class where the professor knowledgeably but not very enthusiastically takes you through Latin American history with a specific focus on workers or revolutionary movements, leftist thinking, and telling the stories not generally told. Very open discussion about US role in the region. Lots of work because it's a writing credit, but if you do it all you'll do well. You really do have to do most of the reading though so it's a lot. If you want specifics, this isn't the right class, but if you want to look at history with a thematic, causes\/effect lens, then this is perfect. Discussion sections were filled with very smart individuals, especially older students. It's challenging but doable for freshman, especially if you're okay with reading a lot.",
    "LAST 364 is for someone who wants to learn this material more from reading and writing than from the lecture itself. I strongly reccomend this for someone who doesn't mind vague lectures but is also willing to do the really interesting reading.",
    "Take it! Such rich and insightful material! One of the more memorable and meaningful history courses I took at Yale. (It's writing intensive though, so be prepared for that... makes an excellent Cr\/D class!)",
    "HIST 363 is a good overview of Latin America after the colonial era, and is a good second half to the survey series if you took Prof. Schwartz' Colonial Latin America class (It is important to note that their teaching styles are very different, so make sure you check it out). There is quite a bit of reading for a lecture course, in addition to weekly page-long reading responses. If you have the time to do that work it will certainly pay off.",
    "If you are looking for a very general overview of Latin American history, this is a good course. However, if you are looking for something more detailed this course may not be the best fit."
