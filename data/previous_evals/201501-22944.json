    "This class is a rollercoaster of intense happiness and intense suffering. It is entirely focused on learning the 3-D digital animation program Maya, and it is simultaneously super enjoyable and utterly depressing: Maya is such a difficult program to work with, but when you get something to move how you want it, it's amazing. I can see years of work ahead of me if I want to make the 3-minute animation I had originally planned out as a storyboard for the class' midterm. How can sitting in front of a computer screen staring at a digital mesh and moving points on it around for five hours be exhilarating? Somehow it is. Johannes is an amazing instructor and really brings a sense of fun to the course; he is a walking encyclopedia of animation throughout the ages, too. It's too bad there isn't much time for discussion of the theory\/history of digital animation because of how much there is to learn in Maya itself, but omg you really do learn a lot. Be prepared to not sleep and eat only erratically for the last month of the course especially. This is a real time suck, but it is worth every second."
