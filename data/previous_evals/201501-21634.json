   "comments": [
    "This is a history class. It just covers history of American infrastructure. The \"modern\" in the title means late 1800s to early 1900s, which in my opinion isn't so modern. The class extensively covers mainly electricity and sustainability, but not the science behind them. It just covers the history. If you want to learn cutting-edge science like nanotechnology, quantum mechanics, or even electromagnetism, you should take another course. If you want a relaxing gut class with field trips and just a midterm, group presentation, two easy problem sets, and a final paper, then this is the class for you.",
    "This course offers a nice overview of many topics in modern science, presented in lecture format. It is great for science and non-science majors interested in a small classroom setting conducive to forming relationships with the peers and professor. The opportunity to present and explain a scientific topic in front of a group is valuable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student! The class was both interesting and engaging, and it has the flexibility to change according to students' interests. Topics ranged from energy and electricity to medical imaging, from the origins of the internet to space flight. The format was lectures given by Professor Prober, along with presentations by students, guest lectures, and field trips to the Yale power plant and to Kroon Hall, all of which made the class interesting and varied. Work consisted of problem sets, presentations, a midterm, and a final research paper. Although we were able to cover a lot of material, the environment was decidedly positive and instead of stressful. I have really enjoyed taking this class, and I will definitely miss it next semester!",
    "Take it if you're more interested in energy related modern technologies",
    "The Science of Modern Technology was an excellent course that effectively introduced students to both the science and history behind many modern technologies. From electricity and energy production to medical imaging and space exploration, the course covered a wide array of topics and technologies. The lectures were engaging, the course work was interesting, and the workload was manageable. The class trips were also great fun. I learned a tremendous amount during the semester and would highly recommend this course to others."
