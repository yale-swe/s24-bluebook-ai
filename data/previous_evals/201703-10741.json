    "I learned a good deal, and the material was very interesting. The class seemed a little disorganized, and the flow of the class (types of assignments, density of homework, etc.) was very inconsistent through the semester. It was difficult to gauge the time needed each week for the various assignments.",

    "If you are interested in 3D printing or scanning or computer vision, there is a lot of useful information here. Otherwise the topic is slightly niche, but could be taken just for fun.",
    "Must-take if interested in 3D printing\/scanning or graphics in general. Great overview of technologies used, and final project gives opportunity for creativity and additional hands-on experience in the field.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's actually pretty interesting and you learn a lot about how the 3D scanning and printers work."
