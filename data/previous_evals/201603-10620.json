   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed General Ecology. I learned a lot of things: population modeling, predator-prey dynamics, niche relationships, competition, island biogeography, biomes, life tables, conservation...! A solid overview of ecology and its present-day applications.",
    "I really enjoyed learning to think about the world in a different way. I learned how to think about things from an ecological perspective and to see how something that seems small can actually have a large impact in an ecosystem.",
    "Great course! Very comprehensive.",
    "I learned a lot about modelling populations and the mathematical aspects of ecology.",
    "Learned about how different populations interact on diffeeent levels of empirical analysis",
    "I learned more about the math that goes behind ecology which was interesting to see",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about all the basic, key concepts of ecology.",
    "I learned a lot of the basic mathematical theory of Ecology as well as its connections to real world situations and policy. I am especially pleased with the knowledge the course gave me about specific studies and data and the ability to synthesize this knowledge with theory to respond to questions. I understand the dynamics of population growth, predator prey systems, meta-populations, island biogeography, effects of stochasticity and intermittent disturbances, as well as energy fluxes, global change, and complexity stability relationships.",
    "The class teaches basic principles of ecology\/ecosystem function like models of population growth, competition, stability, etc. You do two problem sets and two lab reports, in addition to the two midterms and a final.",
    "good quantitative introduction to population dynamics and ecology.",
    "I learnt the basics of ecology and how to set up a lab report",
    "Math skills and biological problem-solving skills developed.",
    "I feel I gained some strong foundational knowledge of ecology from this class as well as how to apply that knowledge in the real world through experimentation and environmental conservation\/management.",
    "I learned how factors in an ecosystem interact and the complexities of ecosystems.",
    "I thought this course was an excellent overview of ecology in general. In particular, I now have a much better understanding of how the mathematical models behind ecology work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the lectures and readings were both solid. The biggest weaknesses of the class in my opinion were section meetings and the assignments (2 problem sets, 2 lab reports). Section often felt a bit pointless, and my section leader several times failed to receive directions from Professors Vasseur and Post. While I learned from the problem sets and lab reports, I think that the class should perhaps restructure its assignment system. Perhaps weekly or biweekly problem sets would prepare students better for the midterms and final alike (there was a lot of quantitative material we never used outside of exams)? I think that the bird lab report could additionally be eliminated from the syllabus.",
    "I liked how there is a variety of assignments in this class. It kept the homework interesting and engaging.",
    "I really liked both of the professors and the fact that they did not just read off the powerpoint.",
    "The glaring weakness was that there were insufficient opportunities to apply and practice the concepts prior to exams",
    "The class offers a comprehensive look at the study of ecology, what experiments people have done, etc. It spends way too much time talking about fish and lakes",
    "I thought the course was taught very well, and all lecture slides were made available online. It could have been a bit more organized regarding clarity on expectations for assignments, and I wish that practice problems were provided to better prepare us for what to expect on exams.",
    "I found this course to be very strong. Post and Vasseur dovetail their lectures effectively and together cover a wide range of theory and experiment. I also found the psets and exams to be fair and useful questions to synthesize knowledge. The two papers had different strengths. The first taught data analysis with the second allowed me to develop expertise in a very specific area of ecological inquiry. Additionally the draft and pear review structure was very good. My only constructive criticism is that the readings were never really necessary for class or section. I wish section had been more about discussing the readings.",
    "The course could be improved if time were better apportioned during lectures to more complex concepts.. The professors would sometimes put 100+ slides in a lecture to be delivered in 50 minutes and it felt like nonintuitive things were sometimes quickly glossed over, leading students to need to go back and learn them themselves for the first time.",
    "instructors need to go slower through the slides. what's the point just flashing text and words at us if we dont have the time to understand anything? also over-emphasis on professors' own work often obscures the main point.",
    "Strengths: covered a lot of material, powerpoint slides were pretty useful Weaknesses: the teaching was quite uninspired, the material was hard to follow, there were no practice tests, the final was unreasonable and not in line with the rest of the course\/ other midterms.",
    "Strengths: Use of gotelli textbook makes concepts easy to learn, learning about certain experiments in the ecological topic we're studying Weaknesses: Going really fast on lectures, leaving the TAs clueless and thus us about what we should expect on midterms",
    "Material of lectures and concepts taught were great and engaging. However, I wish more explanations of what was to be expected on midterms and the final were given.",
    "Section was absolutely useless. We rarely did anything substantive and even when we did, it was loosely if at all focused on improving understanding of the course material. Many of class lectures were often rushed through to the point of glossing over the fundamentals of much of the quantitative material, Professor's focused way too much on their work and continued to reference it in examples when examples from other studies would have added both value and new perspective to understanding of the material. The class needs a major overhaul, section needs to be abolished or restructured to add value.",
    "I found the structure of the class to be mostly good; however there were many weeks where I felt section was pointless and I think the first lab assignment could definitely be improved. Overall, though, I think everything worked very smoothly and there were no gimmicks in the class. I found most of the class to be very straightforward as well as engaging, which I really appreciated.",
    "This class relies heavily on models to explain concepts. This makes the concepts more easily understandable but also can create more confusion with so many of the models. Section seemed a little useless most of the time",
    "The material itself and the lectures were mostly very interesting, as was the content of the lab report assignments. The weaknesses of the course were largely organizational. Things were not returned in a timely manner, instructions were frequently vague and sometimes contradictory, and time in section was poorly used (not a lot of apparent communication between profs and TAs)",
    "I liked this course more than anything because I thought the material was fascinating. It had great breadth, a reasonable level of difficulty, and a good mix of base material and stuff specific to the professors' research. The main weakness I saw was the huge imbalance in workload. The beginning of the semester was really chill, but when the papers hit it was brutal. At the end of the day it didn't even seem like the papers were graded very strictly, so maybe I put too much work into them, but a bit more communication on what's expected and a bit more time for the 2nd paper would've been good."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a basic overview of ecology and is interested in perhaps conducting ecology research while at Yale! Professors Vasseur and Post both do really neat stuff, and emphasized that they often employ undergraduates.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes! Prep for the class beforehand.",
    "It usually was not too much work but every couple of weeks I'd have to spend a very long time on an assignment. I really liked the professors;they have different but complementary lecture styles.",
    "Would only recommend if the student is quantitatively minded, enjoys modeling data, and has a strong interest in science.",
    "this class is a requirement for the EEB and EVST majors. If you are not one of those majors, I wouldn't recommend this course unless you want to learn about ecology in depth.",
    "Yes if you are interested in Ecology take this course! Even if you are not an E&EB major it is very interesting. Econ majors will find the math familiar and the concepts very informative as the other side of the MSY\/Faustmann debate. Physics majors will recognize eigenvalue equations in the literature discussed. Over all really interesting topics and a good introduction to dynamics of population growth, predator prey systems, meta-populations, island biogeography, effects of stochasticity and intermittent disturbances, as well as energy fluxes, global change, and complexity stability relationships.",
    "If you have to take this course for E&EB or EVST you will. If you're interested in continuing with ecology, it will probably be more useful to you because you'll need to understand foundational principles\/modeling systems.",
    "good introduction to ecology but wanted more quantitative grounding. also engagement level was rather low. lectures went too fast because slides were rushed through.",
    "I would only take this course if you absolutely have to. I did not find the material very engaging, especially because of the way it was presented. I went to every lecture, but I don't think I got much from them. This was an okay class, and some of the assignments were interesting, but overall I would not recommend it. Overall, the midterms and lab assignments were reasonable, but the final was really bizarre; it didn't really test the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this course to EVST and E&EB majors.",
    "Depends. This is an EVST requirement, but very heavily focused on the conservation track, especially in the beginning. Regardless of your track, one will learn vital scientific research skills and the global climate change portion is applicable to all. Workload wise, this course is fair- there are two short problem sets, two exams and two big labs which are time consuming but offer a wealth of information and experience from performing research and analysing the lab results. Overall, a pretty relaxed lecture style, based a lot on textbook readings and scientific papers that can be read beforehand so you don't have to scramble to take notes.",
    "Absolutely not, but you have to take it for the E&EB major, my condolences.",
    "I would recommend this course as it offers a lot of insight into the natural world. However, beware that it is a lot more quantitative and theoretically based than you might expect",
    "I recommend this course to everyone interested in biology and the environment. The course tied together a lot of big ideas surrounding ecology, conservation, and global change and gave me insight into species dynamics that I had not been familiar with before. The course is challenging but it is worth the work.",
    "I thought this was a pretty good class. If you're looking to take this class, you probably have to and for good reason. I enjoyed both professors and found pretty much everything aside from the first lab assignment to be really straightforward.",
    "This wasn't my favorite evst class but was interesting and a much better introduction to ecology than bio 104. I'd recommend it to someone interested in the evst bs",
    "If you're interested in ecology, take it, but know that the course is fairly mathematical. Doesn't require you to know a lot of math, but focuses a lot on mathematical models. The textbook is very helpful.",
    "I thought this was a great course but that's cause I love ecology. The workload actually isn't that bad, except the papers (lab reports) are really tedious and a bit confusing. Highly recommend."
