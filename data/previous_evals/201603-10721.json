   "comments": [
    "Appreciation for non-fiction writing and the skills necessary to start one down the path of eloquent essay writing.",
    "I learned about many different genres of creative nonfiction. I thought in new ways about structure, story telling, and truth.",
    "I learned so much in this course. I learned the ways in which writers craft great long-form articles and narratives through the use of certain writing strategies. And through those strategies, we could create authority in our writing and keep our stories engaging by establishing a tension or source of conflict. I wasn't aware just how important tension was in a piece of nonfiction. All the tools that we learned, such as torque or creating a box are all directed towards creating tension, which is what keeps an essay interesting. The workshops also taught me different ways in which I can structure my essays. Before, structure wasn't really something that I thought about when writing, but it has now become something I am very aware of and consider before writing. Furthermore, the individual notes from the professor were extremely helpful in indicating where my writing needed the most work and solutions to make my writing better. After this class, I was able to think more critically at the way in which authors guide the reader through their narrative, which was really helpful in my own writing. It also helped confirm my desire to work in journalism in the future.",
    "This class was incredibly helpful in writing personal essays: from reading tons and tons of example essays, you learn techniques and tips in making your writing more powerful.",
    "I feel that I have greatly developed my non-fiction writing skills in addition to discovering an entirely new form of writing that I never had the opportunity to study formally. English 120 gave me an outlet to write about topics I wasn't previously able to explore in an academic setting.",
    "This class taught me how to write. I have never seen my writing improve by such leaps and bounds in only four months. I am so happy that I took this class.",
    "Overall, I learned how to structure a story to achieve the greatest amount of pull that it could possibly have. This included how to maximize the tension of a certain story and other techniques including the lead, the ending, and framing.",
    "This course is like a cheat sheet for how to write compelling personal essays. You read essays that you are then asked to emulate in your own writing. A true Yale gem.",
    "Before this course, I had very little exposure to creative non-fiction, except for some long-form journalism essays. I had never attempted it myself. In this course, I learnt not only the conventions of the essay genres, but also how to write a generally compelling, engaging and convincing essay. We developed our writing on both a sentence level and on a broader structural level, which was particularly useful for me as I have never considered the ways in which subtle changes to structure can have a large impact on how the essay is read by the reader.",
    "= conflict triangle -> techniques for building tension into narratives = box -> how to construct a box of \"bad guy\" assumptions you want to confer upon your reader, than break out of that box, go deeper beneath it, and present the otherwise unsung truth that defines your argument = empty circle -> how to organize nonfiction essays so that they build up or break down concentrically around a central \"emptiness\", which can represent something unknown\/the main mystery\/a holy grail of sorts\\ AND MUCH MORE",
    "Before taking this course, I had no previous experience with creative non-fiction writing. And to be perfectly honest, I was a bit hesitant about taking it because I heard it is a relatively challenging course. But I'm so glad that I decided to stick with it. Even though the grading might be intense (because of the English department policy from what I understand), I have not only improved my writing skills, but also grown to love the genre of creative nonfiction."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great for teaching the art of essay writing. Sometimes I felt author moves and structures were over analyzed. Many readings were not discussed due to a lack of time.",
    "I think that the strengths of this course is that we read a lot of great pieces of writing and spent a sufficient amount of time analyzing it and breaking it apart that by the end of class, I was able to leave with a lot of tools that I could use for my own writing. Also, because the readings were really interesting, it helped keep me engaged throughout the class. And because the course is a seminar, we're able to have really great discussions about the writing and learn by way of questions rather than simply being lectured. I think that the only weakness of this course is the time constraint. I feel like if we had the time to turn in more drafts to the professor for revisions and recommendations, my writing could have improved even more.",
    "This course was very effective at balancing the amount of reading and writing. I almost always felt that I had gotten an understanding of effective non-fiction essays prior to being asked to submit my own.",
    "David Gorin was the heart and soul of this class. He took our discussions seriously, and he was always excited and passionate about our readings. His extensive comments on our writing were invaluable. I do not think I would have enjoyed this class as much as I did if I had a different instructor. Also, the workshops were a great way for me to learn more about how to write well. It was amazing to see and critique other students' essays.",
    "This class had many strengths. One was the curriculum - we read a variety of stories of very different types, including personal essays, argument essays, place essays, profile essays, and cultural criticisms. The other biggest strength was the professor - he presented the material very well and just asked questions that led the class to the \"right\" answer. One weakness was that the class seemed to favor the best writers and didn't give as much attention to the weaker writers - it took much longer for him to give me back my comments.",
    "I was a big fan of the course, and can think of very few weaknesses. One of the strengths is the workshop lessons, in which the class reads and prepares comments on some of the other students' essays, and then collectively helps to suggest ways in which they could be improved and polished. Also, the structure of the course allowed for a lot of time to work on our drafts before having to submit the final essay, meaning we had the opportunity to put a lot of thought and effort into how our essays could be better. That was definitely important in my overall improvement as a writer. One weakness is perhaps found in the lack of variety of the essays we read. Although we definitely read essays with contrasting, and sometimes controversial, opinions, there were very few essays from different cultures, for example. A greater breadth would have been a positive addition.",
    "Strengths: the wonderful readings (Didion, Wallace, Jamison, etc.), the in-class workshops, more feedback than I've ever received about my writing ever ever ever, the class bonding, the balance of struggling with conceptual frameworks as well as syntactic rhythms, David Gorin, the module structure (place essay -> cultural criticism -> profile -> etc), just about everything Weaknesses: particularly stressful at times, how much different classes varied (writing 4 essays in a semester vs. writing 6 or 7)",
    "The workshop component of the course is absolutely phenomenal. Each week, the entire class, along with the professor, would be focusing on essays written by two of our peers to give them feedback. Exchanging ideas with a group of incredibly talented writers was definitely a highlight of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students interested in writing. We read a few essays in preparation for class. Then discussed what writing moves were working in each. We used them as models to write our own essays of different genres. If you're interested in writing a lot, and really carefully revising your work this is the perfect course for you.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. I think that if you want an spend time to understand the way in which you write and could write, this course would be great for you. I spent more time brainstorming and writing than I ever have before, and that rigor truly helped me improve a lot. However, I think that you really need to have the time available to dedicate to the course in order to reap its full benefits.",
    "I STRONGLY recommend this class to anyone who enjoys writing or is trying to become a better writer. Prof. Gorin will help you tremendously in improving your essays and every class is engaging and enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in taking an engaging course that enhances students writing skills.",
    "I have recommended people to take this class with David Gorin. It has been my favorite class so far at Yale, and my writing skills have improved dramatically.",
    "Yes. I think everyone should take this class (coming from a CS and EE major). It teaches you how to structure a story in the optimal way so that by the end, it is not that hard for you to right an essay that sounds just as good as something from the New Yorker.",
    "Absolutely. I personally was not into writing more analytical papers, as I feel I had done enough in high school, so opted not to take 114\/115 and to take 120. I cannot recommend this class any more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, and already have. It was my favourite course this semester, as it was not only incredibly good for my writing but also a genuine pleasure to go to class. The essays we read were fascinating, and appreciation of short-form writing and creative non-fiction is important for any education.",
    "If you're considering ENGL 120, take it. And try your hardest to take it with David Gorin, perhaps the best teacher I've ever had. The readings are wonderful and immersive. The class dynamic is invigorating. The feedback is unbelievably helpful. (The comments I received for my first essay were longer than the essay itself!) The rhythm of the course is even and time-tested. I've heard only good things about ENGL 120 profs, but Gorin is the consummate writer-professor--insightful, kind, articulate, always editing his spoken words mid-sentence so they more accurately represent his intentions, and undeniably spunky. Wow what a class.",
    "This is definitely a must-take for anyone at all interested in writing. Even if you're not that interested, you'll still find it interesting. The only thing is to make sure that you're up to writing an essay every week. At first it might seem daunting. But once you get into the rhythm, you'll find yourself truly liking it."
