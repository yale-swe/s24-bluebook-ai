   "comments": [
    "Poetry since 1950 is comprehensive and relatively laid back. There are large quantities of reading, but the poems are enjoyable. Two papers, a midterm and a final. Overall a pleasant experience.",
    "1 midterm, 1 4-5 pager, 1 8-10 pager, and a final exam. pretty great course and a totally manageable workload",
    "Pretty enjoyable and not too much work. Good fifth class",
    "Excellent class! I learned so much about not only various poets, but how to read poetry. Professor Hammer was a great lecturer who cares a lot about the subject and is able to demonstrate his expertise on poetry in class.",
    "! I highly recommend this class. Professor Hammer is phenomenal. He's incredibly caring and kind, as well as deeply informed about the poets and poems he teaches. In fact, when asked, he said he personally knew a good number of them. For example, he was friends with James Merrill and is probably the leading authority on his poetry. Not only is it an immense pleasure listening to him lecture; it's also gratifying to watch a poem that was previously opaque to you become lucid. The syllabus covers a wide range of poets, so you've got a very good chance of finding at least a handful of poets you'll probably continue to explore after the semester is over.",
    "Not as easy a class as it would seem. I love poetry but the logistics of the class are tedious...two papers (5 page then a 10 page one), a midterm, a final, and weekly sections. The midterm\/final deal with memorizing each individual poem you've learned in order to be able to pinpoint its author, book\/date of publication, etc. Other than those aspects of the class, it was AMAZING. We learned so much and really dug into topics. Professor Hammer is phenomenal at his work and truly shares that with his students. My TA was insightful and considerate of our section's varying levels of poetry experience.",
    "Take it!",
    "Don't bother.",
    "ENGL 283 is a great course of reading and analyzing poetry, but I'm not sure that I would recommend taking it without a strong background in English. The course was usually very interesting but doing all of the assigned reading took up much more of my time than I had anticipated.",
    "283 is a great class for anyone interested in poetry whether you are a humanities person or not. It is a wonderful way to learn to analyze poetry as a whole and be introduced to trends in the world of contemporary poetry.",
    "This class is a fine way to read some poetry from the last 60 years. It didn't feel particularly rigorous, nor did I feel like I came away knowing an enormous amount more than what I could've intuited, but Professor Hammer is knowledgable, and more interesting conversation could likely be had in his office hours. That said, the poetry is good, but sadly doesn't have to be read to succeed in the course.",
    "An excellent study of English poetry since 1950. A great and diverse syllabus. Prof. Hammer is erudite and sensitive. His lectures were challenging and wide-ranging and ambitious -- and always serenely delivered. His love of the material, and of literature, is apparent. A very straightforward \"poetry lecture,\" with a midterm, two papers, and a final. Great course. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a survey of great English poetry (from across the globe, though especially in the UK and America) in the past half-century.",
    "Definitely take this class. The professor Langdon Hammer is not just a great lecturer but a great teacher. He's unpretentious, engaging, and kind of funny. He always kept it real with his lectures, which I always left with the satisfied feeling of having had knowledge implanted directly into my brain. The work load was reasonable - there was nothing extraneous about it. I think this class would be equally interesting for a seasoned scholar of literature and a simple STEM major.",
    "A good question. At first I thought it would be the culmination of my Yale poetic experiences, but unfortunately it fell really short of that. Interested poets--this class is not necessary your entry into the poetry of today. Of course the reading list is arbitrary, but the worst part is that Hammer himself is not passionate about most of these people. The number of contemporary poets he likes could be counted on one hand. Disappointed is one way to put it. I don't regret taking it, but I took it Cr\/D. Take more established courses if you are new to poetry. If you are a veteran, you are at a stage where you can just look at the reading list and go through it. Class adds very little.",
    "This class definitely exposed me to poetry that I wouldn't have read otherwise. I'm on the fence about recommending it though. I'm not sure if I really became better at reading or writing about poetry through this class although I certainly did more of both.",
    "This class has fantastic material, but Professor Hammer is a pretty boring lecturer.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, the poetry was great and the lectures were usually interesting. There's not much work, as reading poetry is fun and also somewhat optional, but don't expect an easy A, especially if you haven't taken a class like this before. Grades depend a lot on your TF.",
    "This course is pretty light in workload, with a 4-5 page midterm paper and midterm, and 8-10 page final paper and a final. It's easy to not do the readings with as much attention as one should when reading poetry, or to not do them at all, since the midterm and final only test poems that were covered in lecture.",
    "100% recommend. Professor Hammer is a fantastic lecturer, and you'll get a really great overview of modern poetry. A good amount of work but worth it.",
    "I loved this class mostly for its syllabus, which got me a whole bookshelf of wonderful poetry that I really enjoyed reading. The lectures were a little too Wikipedia-y to be really enlightening; they seemed somewhat to waste Professor Hammer's extensive expertise in favor of a somewhat dull biographical overview. Although maybe I would have gotten more out of it if I paid better attention... I did really enjoy my section (Win Bassett) and overall am glad that I took the class. Midterm exam and 5-page paper, final exam and 10-page paper, plus one poem memorized to recite in section.",
    "A really wonderful course on, obviously, poetry since 1950. Over the course of the semester, the pace averages out to about 1 poet per 1-2 lectures (plus some that are only briefly mentioned). Lectures are generally enjoyable, and take a pretty comprehensive approach to reading poetry - diving into the text, but also exploring the poet's life and influences and connections to other poets\/movements. Papers and exams are relatively straightforward and manageable. Small downsides: Hammer can be disorganized, and your experience in the class might vary dramatically depending on your TA. Otherwise, a good experience - as a social science major \/ pre-med, it was a valuable opportunity to learn to think critically in a different way than I'm used to.",
    "Overview of some major poets writing since 1950. Each class focuses on one poet (and most poets get just one day), during which the professor gives some biography and background on that poet and then talks about a couple of their poems. There isn't too much in depth analysis in class, but you do get some in section. Take it if you're interested in modern poetry.",
    "Take it if the readings interest you, and if you think you'll have fun exploring the authors largely on your own. The lectures ranged from average to great. For some poets, Professor Hammer seemed to give general glosses without much exciting insight (the Graham lecture comes to mind as somewhat unexciting). I thought the lectures were best when he had a very original argument or when he discussed, in depth, a poem or a few poems that gave specific insight into a poet. In general, I think he's a more brilliant writer and thinker than he is a speaker, which isn't to say that he's a bad lecturer but that there was a sense he was simplifying things for us. I would especially recommend this class to someone without much background in formal poetic analysis; you can kind of learn as you go, and most of the poems are pretty approachable. Not a must take, but not a bad option either.",
    "You'll really learn a lot, and the lectures are fascinating! The class goes downhill towards the end of the semester and starts to seem a bit haphazard and crammed, but overall I still enjoyed it a lot. The readings are all amazing poetry, and you don't really have to buy any of the books since almost all of it is free online. Take it if you're at all interested in poetry!",
    "This is a very enjoyable class and provides a great summary of poetry since 1950. Professor Hammer's lectures are extremely interesting."
