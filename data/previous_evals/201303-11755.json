   "comments": [
    "Great primer on Africa and the issues facing people within different developing countries. The grading is stiff, though fair.",
    "The strength of the course is that it makes students more comfortable with common methodological strategies used in economics. The primary weakness with the course is that I wish at the expense of one paper there was a summary reading each week that could talk about the issues the continent is facing on a broader, less isolated scale than what the specific economics literature is covering. I leave this class unable to speak with authority on anything related to Africa's economic development broadly.",
    "Take it if you are interested in Africa.",
    "If you are interested in development economics and want to improve your econometrics absolutely take this class. Each week you will read about 3 papers and discuss them thoroughly in class (that's all you do in class). Content is entirely about economics of Africa, i.e. agriculture, microfinance, health, education etc. and papers are very technical, so you will learn how to read and understand difficult empirical strategies. The workload is very manageable: two presentations of papers on the reading list, one short paper, one proposal for a final paper and a final paper, and short worksheets on every paper each week.",
    "Its a good class especially during class discussions.",
    "Sure. Not the most exciting class, but manageable workload and endearing Professor."
