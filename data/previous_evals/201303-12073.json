    "Yes--this class is a relatively painless research methods class for psych majors. The paper is written a bit each week, and the TF was absolutely great. Lecture is interesting usually, and lab goes on a bit long, but some labs were fun. I also feel like I really learned to write a correct APA paper and could do it again.",
    "I would recommend this course! I'm very into happiness and this course was a cool approach to positive emotions and research.",
    "Yes - the best research methods class you cant take if you are lucky enough to get in (no genuinely graded work except the paper). Make sure you take the paper seriously though!",
    "You have to take research methods for the psych major, and this is certainly the one to do.",
    "Better than the basic, typical research methods that you'd have to take in order to fill you psychology major. In that respect, I'd recommend it.",
    "It's a required class, and probably the best option unless you have a specific interest within Psychology.",
    "Only take it if you need the requirement or plan on going into research.",
    "Great class!",
    "Chances are you're taking research methods because it's a requirement for the psych major. I was definitely not looking forward to it, but taking Research Methods in Happiness was not bad at all! Even for someone like me who hasn't had much experience in psychology research, this was pretty manageable. Consisted of 2 hour seminar followed by an hour in lab, neither of which was too difficult, but you still learned a lot about research techniques in emotion, particularly happiness. The most important feature of this class was that Professor Gruber spaced out the research paper over the semester. While this did mean that you have work every week, it makes the end of the semester so much easier - I can't imagine having written this entire paper at once. Some sections of the paper are definitely challenging and a lot of work, but since you're going to have to do it eventually, in my opinion it's much better to spread it out and get feedback on each section. Overall, I think one of the best options for research methods out there! Also Professor Gruber is incredibly nice and caring! If you're in the neuroscience track, there may be ways for you to have this count even though it's not technically neuro-based, so check with your advisor!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE to fulfill your research methods requirement. The biggest perk ofthe class was its structure! Professor Gruber requires that you write your final paper in parts throughout the entirety of the course; by reading period, you only have to edit and finalize your paper for submission. It was a great course and one that I will remember as I continue my studies at Yale.",
    "Definitely recommended. It's probably the most painless way to get rid of the research methods requirement: no exams and the 20 page paper is written throughout the semester, to all just be submitted on the last day of class. But be warned: there is a mandatory 1 hour lab right after the 2 hour lecture that is not mentioned in the syllabus. It's not a difficult lab at all, but since it is not mentioned until you're actually in the class it did cause some scheduling difficulties for some."
