   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! If you have any interest in political theory generally or political violence specifically, or if you just want to be in an incredibly well-structured seminar with stimulating readings, a manageable workload and an incredible professor, take this class! It may be hard to get in, but if you do, don't get intimidated-- it's a must!",
    "I would recommend this course, but readings can be a bit dry at times.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. We covered an extensive list of theorists and philosophers related to political violence. While some of the readings were heavy on the \"philosophy,\" Professor Kapustin was great at explaining their theories and offering his own insight.",
    "This course provides a solid introduction to continental political theory. Discussion could have used a few more of 1) people seriously committed to Theory, and 2) people with extensive background in philosophy.",
    "Everyone should take course with kapustin and this course is brilliant",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, but make sure that you're really into political theory because that's what the class is all about.",
    "If you are into politics or historical theory or any sort of cool applied or political philosophy, take this course. It will be tough; you will read sentences like \"any historico-political analysis of violence is bound to be constrained by the rational contingencies of an inter-ordinal discourse\"; kapustin will remind you of Frank Underwood. And it will be awesome. Do it. Also it's not that much work.",
    "This was a highly theoretical survey course about overt forms of physical violence, subtle forms of violence, and alternatives to violence. I appreciated that this class didn't glorify violence in any way; rather, it allowed me to understand the complexities behind political violence and have a more functional and well-informed view of politics. If you're looking for a class focused on current events or case studies, though, this isn't it.",
    "This is a solid course that examines political violence from different lenses. Take it if you get in - Kapustin's classes are all worth it, and take advantage of his office hours. He's extremely caring and excited about the material he teaches. I would advise some background in political philosophy first, and be prepared to deal with EPE majors who want to suck up and bring up Hegel all the time unnecessarily. But that comes with the terrain.",
    "This class is absolutely incredible. Kapustin is the best professor in the game. His brilliance, care, and thoughtfulness are unparalleled, and he offers an opportunity through this class to approach the work of certain continentalists in a way that is worthwhile and significant. This is the greatest class I have taken at Yale to date, and will be hard to beat. I get chills thinking about how amazing it was."
