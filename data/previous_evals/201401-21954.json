   "comments": [
    "Basic lab class, I would recommend it, it helped reinforce what was being taught in CHEM 115.",
    "Only if they have to.",
    "I would not recommend CHEM 117L to another student unless it is a requirement for their major\/needed to progress to other courses.",
    "If it is a requirement you should take it, if not you should still take it.",
    "If youre taking this course, you probably need to for you major or for pre-med anyways, so enjoy!",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. It is somewhat interesting, but the lab reports can be long (a few of them) and the weekly lab lasts 4h (if you really take your time). It wasn't that bad, but I preferred CHEM 116L.",
    "It's a four hour lab, but it's definitely doable. That said, don't procrastinate, or it will get you.",
    "I would recommend that another student take this class only if they needed it as a pre-req. It is time-consuming, stressful, and difficult.",
    "I would not recommend this lab if you can avoid it. It was very time consuming and boring.",
    "117 is just another chem lab, nothing special. If you took 116 before, be prepared for much more difficult experiments and more in depth reports. Dr. G is inconsistent as ever, but what are you going to do.",
    "Chem 117 is a well run lab course. Take it if you have to. Its very fair and the there are a lot of resources to help you. Anyone can do well in this class if you try.",
    "i mean you only really take chem lab if you need it. just good luck. prepare for the lab quizzes and read the labs before hand",
    "You are taking this class because you have to. It is going to be incredibly unpleasant, but you have to do it so you might as well get used to it.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 117L, but the lab reports are long.",
    "A bit more challenging than Chem 116L, but not unreasonable. The lab reports take a lot longer than those in 116L, but there are less titrations! (yipee)",
    "Tedious, exhausting lab but does its job in teaching us the basic skills.",
    "Take this class if you need to! It will provide you with many helpful laboratory techniques. It is directly correlated with the introductory chemistry sequences, so what you learn in the Intro classes will be demonstrated through the labs. It is a great way to gain experience in a chemistry laboratory setting.",
    "This lab requires a lot of time and is helpful if being taken with general chemistry.",
    "Avoid at all costs. Unless you plan on majoring in science or do pre-med this class is one of the most brutalizing courses at Yale.",
    "The lab helped drive home some of the main points of the lecture part of the class, and we tried out the calculations with real data, but sometimes they came before the lessons in class so I found it challenging at times to figure out what to do before we learned the material. The lab really drove home the material though and I liked how hands-on it was. The lab is for tactile learners.",
    "I would not recommend this lab unless you need it for an requirement. It is long and tedious and the experiments aren't particularly interesting. Lab reports are very difficult to write because the instructors deduct points for very small things that are rather ambiguious.",
    "DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THIS CLASS! It is completely different from Lab 116 and much harder because they are just stingier grade wise. I learned a lot and it was helpful, but the two week labs are killer and sometimes monotonous.",
    "I would recommend the lab to any student interested in learning more about Chemistry and applying his\/ her knowledge with some engaging experiments.",
    "Chem 117L will expose you to many different laboratory procedures and methods, and though this in itself is quite fascinating, the course will require a significant amount of your time through the completion of the lab reports, and your effort will only be rewarded with a mere half credit.",
    "This class is a good extension of 116L.",
    "I probably would but would warn them that they need to prepare thoroughly for each lab because some of the quiz questions have not been covered in chemistry lecture, which makes them very difficult sometimes.",
    "This is a rough course and I would not recommend it unless you need to take it for major\/pre-professional requirements. Just be prepared, it is not a fun course.",
    "Very time consuming course but necessary for many pre-med requirements. Learn basic lab skills and chemistry topics.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student taking CHEM 115: it helps solidify one's understanding of the concepts covered in 115. The labs are designed to covered a respective topic in chemistry, so by the end of the course one is left with a strong understanding of general chemistry.",
    "Chem 117L is a comprehensive laboratory course which involving a wide array of challenging general chemistry themes and concepts. I would recommend it because it gives real world lab experience.",
    "take it if need be, but if you dont have to then it's not worth the time",
    "It was a comprehensive class but you should only take it if it is necessary to your major. There was a ridiculous amount of work (the labs were very long) although the class was worth only one credit.",
    "GenChem Lab II is the bigger, meaner brother of GenChem lab I. Same quizzes, same lab reports, just longer and more brutal and stressful. It's really rough that the grade cutoffs for the second semester gen chem lab are the same as the first semester, because the work is so much harder! The quizzes are particularly brutal. First semester you can get by without studying for them, but you really need to prepare for these. You definitely learn good lab techniques, I just think the whole experience could be made less hazing. This course is probably the biggest premed weed out there is (I guess apart from Orgo).",
    "Chem 117L 01 is a ton of work. I wouldn't recommend it but it is a pre-med requirement. The grading is too harsh. Some of the experiments would be enjoyable and very interesting, but the duration of the lab and the length of the experiments and writing severely took away from the learning experience and added a lot of unnecessary stress. Overall, very unpleasant and I dreaded it each week.",
    "I recommend it to anyone who is willing to put in the time before lab to writ the procedure neatly and write up the lab report. There is harsh grading so there is extra work involved to not make mistakes.",
    "Only take the course if you need it to fulfill a requirement for a major or pre-professional program; it is a lot of work otherwise for a half credit course.",
    "Chem 117 is a manageable lab as long as you prepare adequately and listen during the pre-lab lecture and lab session.",
    "Only take this class if you need it for your major.",
    "I would not recommend this course, but I know many students will take it because of major requirements or pre-professional programs. I would summarize it as a lot of practical accuracy in Chem lab with some theoretical understanding of the concepts behind the experiment. It goes well with CHEM 115--many of the same concepts are covered.",
    "This lab is slightly harder than 116L but all around a good class.",
    "CHEM 116L does a good job preparing you for CHEM 117L. Without it I don't know what I would have done. Dr. G tends to assume that we all took CHEM 116L. This is course that you take if you have to.",
    "It is fairly time consuming and a bit hard because you have to yeah yourself a lot of te information and formulas.",
    "For students who are taking chem 115, I believe this course is helpful to understand the materials. I would recommend taking them together.",
    "Take it if you have to!",
    "Let's be real, you're taking this because you have to. It's fine, you'll survive.",
    "117L is definitely harder than 116L. Be prepared for a lot of work (I could spend over 8 hours on a lab report), but if you are willing to invest the work, you are pretty much guaranteed an A. Take this lab if you HAVE to; otherwise, there are far more interesting labs that don't take nearly as much time or energy. Dr. Ganapathi is a very thorough lecturer; sometimes I learn more in my hour\/week with him than in actual chem lecture. In lab, he is straightforward about his expectations (though sometimes those seem unattainably high) and fair as long as students meet those expectations.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have two. It is four hours a week, plus at least another 4 - 8 hours a week writing up the lab reports.",
    "Its intro to chem lab. If you are taking it, you probably have to, so there isnt much of a reason to answer this question. Just be meticulous in your lab report because Dr. G will take points off on every little mistake.",
    "Its a premed Requirement",
    "It is much tougher than 116L and you need to go in preparing.",
    "Lots of busy work for bad grades. A royal pain in the a$$.",
    "A typical General Chemistry Lab. Not terribly exciting, and at times it was a bit frustrating with the workload. I don't think this class should be a half credit, as it requires the effort as a normal class. Take it if you have to, otherwise I wouldn't.",
    "Good lab course with long reports.",
    "Chem 117L is a great aid for learning chemistry. It stays in pace with gen chem lecture, and, many times, topics that I found confusing in gen chem lecture were clarified in chem 117 lab. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in chemistry.",
    "If a student were taking Chem 113\/115 I would definitely recommend CHEM 117L because it helped me to understand the material that we were learning at that time in the lecture course.",
    "Experiments were very intriguing",
    "This is the basic lab requirement and it feels like a requirement. You do gain a lot of useful and relevant lab experience though, despite the sometimes tedious 4 hour labs.",
    "Basically the same as Chem 116L. Necessary for premed requirements. Occasionally it proved helpful for Chem 115 exams and problem sets. Lots of busy work, writing the procedure over and over in the lab notebook and on reports. Reports are easy, lots of instruction for how to do them is provided on the report sheets. Take this class if you need it for your major\/premed.",
    "only take it if you have to.",
    "CHEM 117L is a great intro lab class. Dr. G is one of the best chemistry lecturers in Yale and his pre-lab lectures are always interesting to hear. The labs are fun to do, but most of them use the entire time allotted and can be a little repetitive.",
    "This is a very good class. The quizzes are rather hard but the labs are fun",
    "A fair and straightforward class. You will learn everything as promised and get a good grade with a bit of effort. The workload is disproportionately high for the half credit, though, and the material can be mind-numbing. Take if you have to (and don't be too afraid) and avoid otherwise.",
    "very fun class. the labs are very cool and very interesting, but i you need to be very specific with your answers and you need to write exactly what dr. g is looking for.",
    "Good course, same difficulty level as 116L - not really much difference except each lab pertains to the material that you learn in chem 115.",
    "This lab is kind of awful. Only take it if you have to. It isn't nearly as helpful as chem 116l.",
    "Do not take this class if not required for your major. It was a major step up in terms of workload compared to 116L. The class is basically a continuation of that course with a larger workload, and operated like it (we hit the ground running). If you did not take 116L, you may be taken aback at the start by Dr. G's expectations for data sheets and lab reports, so falling behind early can be a problem. Seriously consider taking 116L first. It is always nice to see the concepts learned in the lecture course in practice (and certainly helped me to commit some of those concepts to memory), but overall it is a lot of work (each lab report took at least 3 hours), and you will typically use almost all of that 4 hour time slot for the experiment at hand. I was lucky enough to get a great TA who helped me to understand the concepts at hand (needed for the lab reports), and showed me how to do some of the trickier parts of the experimental procedure. I got through 116L without much problem, but 117L had me questioning why these lab courses are worth only half a credit.",
    "Chem 117L is a standard general chemistry lab course - I wouldn't expect life-changing epiphanies to occur, nor would I expect to be bored out of my mind. I would recommend it only because there's no other option for Gen Chem lab, and also because it is taught well if you have Dr. V and a good TA. It's a prerequisite, nothing more, but it's at least not the most painful one.",
    "Only take this if you have to do so for a major. It's not the worse course ever, but it's far from the best and just not worth your time and energy if you don't need to take it. A lot of repetitive experiments, with a few interesting ones interspersed. Does give some context to the lecture material, but not enough to really make the course worth it.",
    "Chem 117L is hard (and a lot of work!) but very rewarding. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As long as you are willing to put in the work to finish the lab reports, the class is very manageable.",
    "The second semester of general chemistry lab is significantly more difficult, but the first semester prepares you well for it.",
    "This lab is really not fun. A few experiments are entertaining and it does teach the basic techniques of working in a lab, but it is extremely boring and difficult, often because of factors are that are out of the students\u2019 control. The TA was very unhelpful, and grading at times seemed very arbitrary. To do well takes a lot of preparation and the class is definitely more work than a regular 1 credit class. I would not recommend the class unless it is a requirement. To do well, prepare the procedure\/purpose\/general overview beforehand, and make sure to be very neat and organized. Also, Microsoft Excel is very helpful for making graphs. Good luck.",
    "same as chem 117 part I. nothing new. nothing unexpected.",
    "This lab course is difficult and required a lot of work, but it is very beneficial in teaching you the basics of laboratory work and if you really like science, it is very interesting!"
