    "A generally fun knowledge of the history of America's most intriguing court cases. There is much to learn about the nation's history based on the context and environment each case was held in.",
    "Got a really good overview of some of the most important cases in American history. Knowledge the everyone should be acquainted with!",
    "learning about a vast array of cases, thinking critically about the law involved, about the background (time\/place) that allowed these cases to happen. incredibly thought provoking stuff",
    "I learned how to look at trials from a legal and media perspective, and I learned how to talk about certain important trials of the 20th century.",
    "How to assess trials from a variety of lenses",
    "In depth understanding of famous trials in American History, and more importantly a better ability to debate and discuss ethical issues that arise in the law."

   "comments": [
    "There isn't too much discussion sometimes in the class, more of a lecture style. But very interesting overal and we did at points have really Interesting debates",
    "Engaging and well designed course. You learn a lot about the trials and the country at their time, without having to do a ton of work. Ford is fun in class. I'm not sure if he has to, but since he basically accepts the entire roster site unseen from apps, about half the class barely talked. As much as I love my laptop, banning them probably would increase engagement.",
    "This is like a lecture + seminar = leminar. Jack Ford is so knowledgeable about all the cases (he was basically there or involved in many of them) and is able to provide firsthand information. Discussion section is good if you have a class of people who are engaged.",
    "this course is amazing!!!! absolutely no weaknesses, and no area for improvement. it's amazing!! really thought provoking cases chosen to study, and Jack Ford is truly awesome -- he makes learning so much fun. this course was amazing, DEFINITELY take it if you can!!!",
    "No weaknesses. Incredibly great readings and discussions",
    "A fantastic course- keep it just as it is",
    "Strengths: Professor Ford, Professor Ford, and Professor Ford. Weaknesses: Literally none. (And I am a horribly picky person for the record)"

    "Yes! Great class--interesting and. It overburdening",
    "Absolutely. It's a wonderfully fun senior spring course, with a very light workload. Plus, you get to learn about some of the most famous and important trials in recent history. We analyzed the social setting of each trial, which provided an overview of 20th century history from a new angle (though since the class was organized by theme rather than time, it wasn't linear).",
    "Yes, take if if you can get in! Got a really good overview of some of the most important cases in American history. Knowledge the everyone should be acquainted with!",
    "You will not find a more rewarding class at Yale. If you have the opportunity this is a must take. Ford does an amazing job",
    "YES 100% RECOMMEND!! IF YOU CAN GET INTO THIS CLASS, DEFINITELY TAKE IT!!!!! Jack Ford is such an amazing and interesting person, and awesome professor -- he really makes it easy and fun to learn, and wants all of his students to succeed. Work load was much less -- take home midterm, studying each week for the cases, and one final paper. truly my favorite class at Yale. TAKE TAKE TAKE!!",
    "100% best class i've taken at Yale",
    "best course I took at yale.",
    "Trials of the Century is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's a perfect seminar, has just the right amount of discussion and a bit of lecturing from Professor Ford as well, who has truly seen it all as a defense lawyer, prosecutor, and member of the media. Some of his stories are hilarious, others quite thought-provoking, and this class is a great way to spend your senior spring if you can get into it.",
    "yes 100%, fantastic course for anyone of any major",
    "One of the best classes at Yalez take it if you get in, not too much work and professor ford is amazing",
    "YES YES OMG YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS. If you are lucky enough to get in then don't you DARE give up this opportunity. Not only is the subject material off the charts cool and interesting, but Professor Ford is the most incredible professor us mere mortals could ask for. He has tried murder cases, covered the O.J. Simpson trial, and a million other amazing things. He brings with him so much life experience and cool personal stories, which is such a refreshing break from academics who have never really lived the things they talk about. He leads the most fascinating class discussions but more importantly he is just a lovely person and so nice and available for his students. Seriously you couldn't ask for a better class.",
    "I would recommend it but not without reservations. It definitely leans leminar (lecture-style seminar), but I personally don't object to that. Prof. Ford, as a former prosecutor and TV journalist, he has plenty of cool stories and expert knowledge to share. Super personable professor who wants you to learn, have fun, and do well. You can get away with not doing all of the readings and documentaries, but I did mostly because they were fun and interesting. Low-pressure senior spring course but it is LONG and feels LONG because there aren't a lot of chances to talk in class."
