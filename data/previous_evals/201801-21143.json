    "Sometimes topics seem irrelevant (the unit on fairy tales)",
    "I felt like a lot of grammar was taught this semester, but none of it from a practical standpoint. In my opinion, grammar is most effectively taught using examples rather than rules so that students can understand the context in which it might fall in everyday conversation. Rather, the grammar was taught from a prescriptive, rule-following standpoint, which a) is not as useful and b) leaves out the millions of exceptions that occur in German."

    "I mean, as languages here go I think German is among the more laid-back ones. The professors are very good about giving feedback and understanding that students may not learn a new language so quickly at this age."
