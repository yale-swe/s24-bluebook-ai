    "A keen interest in China's modern interest and a strong grasp of the language are crucial in benefitting most from this class. Once there, Professor Su is an excellent, patient mentor whose brain you can really pick to discuss the cultural and political implications of the works we study. Being a professional writer himself, many of the writers we study are his associates and he has great background knowledge of these works for an interesting and well-informed discussion.",
    "This is a Chinese course for high-level speakers only. There are many heritage learners in the class, which can be intimidating for non-heritage speakers. However, non-heritage speakers should not shy away from this class for that reason alone. The exposure to these Chinese texts is very valuable.",
    "Only take this class if you are looking for a class that isn't a lot of work.",
    "This is one of the highest level Chinese classes, so you should be prepared to read a lot and memorize vocabulary when you take it. I would recommend it to anyone who has a strong interest in China, Chinese and especially the early 1900s period.",
    "very similar to 158a.",
    "Good class if you want to learn read Chinese texts, and improve your Chinese vocabulary and writing.",
    "I do not recommend this course.First of all, the texts dealt in this class are very difficult; especially if you are coming directly from the third year Chinese classes (whether you get it from yale or Light), very difficult vocabulary, huge list of words to memorize.The typical class would be filled with Su laoshi's stories (most of them are interesting), but it becomes less about Modern Chinese literature than anything else. While you can read them yourself and think about them, but that can be done by yourself, don't really need to take the class....but the authors you read are all famous and well-known in Chinese modern history...some of them are good stories...If you want to hear Su laoshi's story, though, take the class and see for yourself...You have 1 pre-quiz, 1 tingxie, 1 zaoju, 1 hw set for each story. For every 2 stories are so, you have 1000 word essay. 2 exams, and 1 final presentation. Workload is higher than you would imagine, and much higher than what you learn..."
