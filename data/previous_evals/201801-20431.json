   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about biology and ecology, and how everything fits together. I also learned more about plants, animals, and fungi than I previously knew, and about the world and interactions between organisms and the environment as a whole.",
    "I learned a lot about ecology and evolution. Very interesting material",
    "I learned a lot about evolution! I got to see the diversity of extant and extinct species, and learn about how organisms have interacted with their environments through time. It was all very interesting!",
    "how to see how animals relate to each other, biological techniques, and analyzing data",
    "This course was a fair and clear explanation of the importance of evolution to modern biological science. We explored the different impacts caused by natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and other evolutionary pressures. Furthermore, the class used these as the backdrop to explore the interactions of species and biomes. This information was in all cases supported by modern an historical scientific evidence from Charles Darwin to Jonathan Losos.",
    "Learned about plants, animals, and general theories on evolution.",
    "I learned basic evolutionary biology.",
    "Received a comprehensive overview of major evolutionary events, enjoyed learning the developmental process for how feathers emerged (and that T. Rex was fluffy!), and liked knowing how animals were related to one another via the Tree of Life. I gained insight into how miraculous life is given that random chance played such a critical role in specific developments which led to shaping the world we have today.",
    "I learned that I really love learning about animals and plants!",
    "I gained a greater insight into evolutionary biology and its many affects on the world and diversity as we know it.",
    "I learned a lot about the fundamentals of ecology\/evolutionary biology, especially in concerns to the dynamic relationship between the two. One of the most important lessons I took away from this course is that evolution can be explained in a storytelling manner, making it much easier for me to put everything in order.",
    "I learned a ton about evolutionary biology and ecology in context of their modern applications and relevant studies and research going on in those fields.",
    "You learn about ecology and evolution.",
    "the basics of phylogeny, evolution, and ecology.",
    "I learned a lot about plants and fungi as well as ecological and environmental factors in our world in the past and today. This class also taught me about reading scientific papers and how to interpret the results. Also, the class taught us about evolution and the plants and animals most influential, depending on eras.",
    "With this course, I learned how to look at biology from the evolutionary and ecological perspectives in a way that was fun and constantly stimulating.",
    "This course was a survey of concepts and topics in E&EB. Main takeaways: thinking in phylogenetic terms and knowing relationships between major living clades. I also learned how to do a literature review on a clade and trait.",
    "I learned about evolution and ecology, and how to construct a paper for a biology course.",
    "A very well-structured overview of life history and evolutionary principles. You learn about fossils, molecular methods to infer phylogenetic relationships, ecological interactions. Some of the stuff is really fascinating. If you're into theoretical, logical stuff, you'll for sure find the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (a population that is static, without natural evolution) and inferring phylogeny interesting. If you like dates\/history, then you'll enjoy learning about the time scales (eras) of life on earth. But most of all, if you have any sense of fascination at the complexity of modern life, you'll be enchanted by the strange, wonderful species you learn about.",
    "I learned a lot about evolution of the different lineages of organisms both extinct and alive today as well as how they interact with their environments!",
    "Solid grasp of phylogenetic concepts in a way that I have never learned before. The depth to which we studied evolutionary history and biological interactions was much greater than AP bio or previous bio sequence classes.",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for ecology, which was critical in my deciding to major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology! I also bettered my skills in applying scientific concepts to real-life situations.",
    "I definitely gained a greater understanding of ecology and the overall history of life. I now understand better why some organisms have developed to be the way they are, how different major groups came to be, and how the earth has changed over the course of history. I also have a better understanding of how biologists today are able to track evolution through the ages. I gained a stronger passion for the study of ecology and evolution.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about ecology and evolution, while also building on prior biology knowledge.",
    "Reading and making phylogenetic trees; refined skill of reading scientific papers; learned about the complexity of the world and how humans are connected to everything else",
    "This course highlighted the main frameworks and thinkers who have conceptualized ecology and evolutionary biology, using diverse organismal examples that also allowed us to study the history of life and its development. Professor Donoghue highlighted how ecological and evolutionary processes are inseparable and create each other interdependently.",
    "We learned a ton about any rural history evolution and ecology, like a lot. I also gained insights into what a species is, the scale and maginitude of ecosystems all around us, and the insane complexity and nuance of evolution",
    "I think I gained a working background knowledge in ecology and evolution that could help me in my future science career.",
    "understanding of ecology & evolutionary biology, how systems interact.",
    "I learned a great deal about the tree of life and web of life and developed interest in ecology.",
    "I learned about the basics of evolution and ecology as well as how everything in life is connected.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history of the earth and everything that lives on it. Additionally, ecological relationships were explained and presented with many examples. The class taught several skills for analyzing phylogeny and presented its importance.",
    "I gained a framework for understanding ecology, evolution, and their relationship, with a balance between fundamental overarching themes\/concepts and detailed examples from nature. I also learned about the history of these fields and I read papers about recent developments.",
    "I learned about phylogenetic trees, interspecific interactions, evolution, and how many species and groups of species are related evolutionarily.",
    "I learned a lot about the evolutionary history of plants and animals. I learned about many phylogeny methods such as making trees and different ways of dating.",
    "I learned the basics of evolutionary biology as well as ecology. The course was very interesting and describes the changes on Earth over time. The course explains the connection between the path of evolution and the changing environment on Earth.",
    "Learned about phylogeny",
    "Evolutionary biology is all about a different way of thinking about material and applications.",
    "I feel that I have a greater understanding of the diversity of life, as well as the relationships between organisms and between organisms and their environments.",
    "Biology",
    "I learned about diverse species as well as the evolution of many organisms and how evolution is studied, such as through phylogenetic trees.",
    "I learned about the interrelatedness and development of life on earth!",
    "Learned about ecology and evolution on a very introductory level. Most of the class is just learning about weird cool organisms that demonstrate certain ecological concepts. A lot of it is very similar to high school bio, though it goes into some subjects in much more detail.",
    "This class reintroduced me to my love for biology! We learned a lot about evolution and it felt like ecology took a back seat at first but also blended nicely with the origin of many clades. We first did natural selection, then moved to the origin of plants, fungi, and then animals.",
    "Ecological and evolutionary aspects of biology, class evaluations, phylogenetic analyses.",
    "I learned the principles of ecology and evolutionary biology and how they interact with one another. I also gained the ability to critically read scientific ecology and\/or evolutionary biology papers.",
    "This sequence was different from the others in the sense that there was a lot of memorization and like things you just had to know for the exams. It was a pretty thorough overview of just life in general and the becomings of life and evolution which was really cool, there was just a lot to know",
    "I gained the knowledge of ecology and evolutionary biology and how genetics and the species environments affect their adaptations.",
    "I learned a lot about the evolution of life. I learned about different tools utilized by evolutionary biologists.",
    "In this class, I learned the fundamentals of ecology and evolutionary biology, including concepts relating to phylogeny, niches, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, various selective pressures, interspecies relationships, and so much more. The class gave students a great introduction to the history of life and the life forms as we know them today, providing context for how species evolve within their respective ecosystems.",
    "I developed the knowledge of various phylogenies and how all life is interrelated. I developed the skills to write my own research paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great overall.",
    "This course was very well organized and explained which helped keep up. The material was also really interesting which helped keep me engaged. Overall, I think there should be more communication\/cohesion in the intro biology sequence. This doesn't really apply to Bio 104 as I think the professor did a good job of trying to tie in other parts of the intro sequence, but there were weird gaps in the sequence (we never actually learned about photosynthesis) so I think the intro sequence should be better arranged.",
    "There was a lot of writing involved in this course. I am an english major and enjoy writing more than the average student, but I think for this course pset's would have been better for test prep",
    "I liked that this course allowed us to engage with the material more. We were able to go to the marsh gardens and the peabody and see all of the cool diversity present here on Yale's campus. The one thing I would say to improve this course is to have review sessions that have been planned rather than just Q&A sessions. The Q&A sessions are helpful, but not as much as the review sessions from BIO 101-103.",
    "weakness - too many people and sometimes the slides weren't in order strengths - stretch breaks and clear material\/what to do",
    "Strengths: The papers were integrated into the course in a way that emphasizes the most important points and glosses over the methods and complex background information. While this may be dull for students with very strong scientific backgrounds, it does serve to create a level and fair playing field. During one section we had the option to either attend a tour of the Peabody collections or the Marsh Botanical Gardens. This was an excellent addition to the course. As someone whose biological sciences are lacking, the exposure to actual honest-to-goodness plants and animals was a great wakeup to the material of the course. Though this did lack any tie-in to the course material. It would have been a fine addition to the final to have a question at the end asking for an interesting fact from the tour you went on. Section was always good. Weaknesses: The lectures were often delivered in a dry and unengaging tone. Michael Donahue's passion was occasionally apparent but rarely translated into energy or enthusiasm from the crowd of undergraduates. The 5-page paper which is the majority of the out-of-class work isn't started early enough in the course and left me struggling in the last few weeks with a variety of other tasks which needed doing at the same time. This was quite possibly a factor of my procrastination, not the course design.",
    "The course is pretty interesting, and it's nice to learn about animals, but the tests are so much memorization that feels unnecessary.",
    "strengths: good lecturer, good p-sets weaknesses: no practice for final exam",
    "Strengths- instructor was engaging and passionate about the content!!! Weaknesses- very heavy on memorization, clade paper seemed unnecessary",
    "amazing course! taught and facilitated well, and the material was presented in an interesting matter",
    "The psets and writing assignments follow no regular pattern, but this is a very minor thing. The TF's and professor were incredibly helpful in every facet of the class.",
    "Strengths: everything you need to know is on the slides, so a textbook is not really needed. Piazza is great for asking questions.",
    "The order of the course made a lot of sense, as each lecture built on the last. I really loved that the slides were so organized and that each discussion section allowed us to reinforce our knowledge. It was also nice having the lecture outline at the start and end of each chapter so that the big ideas could be reinforced.",
    "The slides are easy to follow and all the information is on them",
    "I really enjoyed this course a lot. the material was fascinating, and Donoghue really taught everything well. My only complaint about the class is that so much of the grade relies upon the midterm and final (which is fine), but the grade distribution for the midterm was very narrow, meaning that, because the intro bio sequence has strict percentage cutoffs for grades, the difference between letter grades is very small and slightly arbitrary. This made the class a bit stressful because it felt like I was competing to be just a pint or two able every else, which is silly. I'm not sure how to exactly fix this issue besides changing the grading system or designing the test to have a wider distribution.",
    "You learn a lot of very interesting stuff about how the world ecosystems function and how evolution is driven.",
    "Strengths: great professor, well organized, very informative weaknesses: none",
    "I think the course had a lot of great information that was taught but not thoroughly understood from lecture. I understand that for exams, it was more important to memorize some of the information, but that kept me from truly getting engaged with the material.",
    "I loved everything about this course. I thought that the assignments made sense and were the appropriate difficulty level, that every assignment was intentional, informative, and fun, and that there was a wonderful focus on making the material enjoyable and stimulating rather than just being hit over the head with needless facts. I enjoyed every minute of class, and actually enjoyed studying the material during finals period!",
    "The course was very effectively structured, and I enjoyed every lecture in part due to the logical flow of content.",
    "I think its a little fast paced, so while I got to learn a little about many different topics, I only gained general understanding and nothing deeper.",
    "Structure was excellent. Section was chill and a good way to consolidate topics of interest. Prof was excellent and very experienced lecturer.",
    "The professor is who made this course amazing! This was the only biology module that I enjoyed.",
    "Very clear lectures and you only need to know what was said in lecture, a lot more memorization-based than 101-103 but at least you know what you need to know and it makes sense",
    "Really awesome format. Lectures were very engaging. Best class of the intro bio sequence by far. Only thing I think could be improved is section. The journal club format seemed kind of out of place. Sections were often unengaging.",
    "This course effectively covers ecological and evolutionary biological concepts in a way that's pretty easy for students to understand. I cannot think of any weaknesses or improvements. I greatly enjoyed the tours to Marsh Gardens\/the Peabody Museum, so I would highly encourage the continuation of that.",
    "I think the course was very interesting and I really enjoyed the material. I think the positives are that it makes ecology and evolutionary biology really interesting and made me want to continue learning. The assignments also made me feel like I was actually doing something interesting and scientific that I enjoyed. I didn't really have any negatives with the course.",
    "The strength of this course was how well it adapted to each student. At every turn, students were given a plethora of options in terms of shaping their own learning. Some examples include the field trips and the final paper. Additionally, a strength of this course was its predictability. It was always very clear what was expected on assignments and examinations, and this made it easy to prepare for class and be successful.",
    "Prof Donaghues passion for the material and for teaching was a big strength of the course. The only weakness I can think of is that the format of the lecture slides on canvas was a little confusing - it would have been better if they were each labeled with their topic, and each set of slides only included the info from one topic (rather than the carryover from previous days).",
    "The course had research assignments and problem sets that aided my learning and presented the terms I would need for the examinations in a very clear and straightforward manner. I cannot think of weaknesses.",
    "This course is much better taught and organized than the previous bio modules. However, it would be a more engaging and interesting course if the focus was less on memorization, especially memorizing phylogenetic trees that scientists will probably revise as soon as we learn them.",
    "Strengths; the best into bio segment by Far, lectures were interesting, easy to follow, and the stretch breaks made them easier to sit through. Weaknesses: intro bio sequence is hard because we are constantly adjusting to new classes and new professors.",
    "strengths: GREAT lectures, amazing and engaging pictures + Examples weaknesses: N\/A",
    "I wish there had been a practice test for the final exam and answer keys for the practice midterm.",
    "Wonderful teacher with very interesting information! The teaching style is a huge plus and everyone really appreciated the small stretch breaks during class.",
    "What a relief after 102 and 103!! Pretty good course in that it does apply some of the knowledge from 101-103, but does not rely on it too much. The week where we had field trips instead of section was great! I wish it was easier to go to both the marsh gardens and the Peabody.",
    "Strengths: very interesting lectures with engaging slides and supplemental material, discussion sections were run well, the homework was very reasonable. Weaknesses: the class was very backloaded with very little work at the beginning and two papers and a final at the end. There was less critical thinking than, say, Bio 102, and more memorization (but this is the nature of the material).",
    "Biology 104 was absolutely fantastic and hands down the best module in the introductory biology sequence.",
    "This was a fantastic course. It was taught extremely well and was organized beautifully. The expectations for the students were clear, and they were provided additional resources to help with their learning. All of the assignments were geared toward student learning in a meaningful way. Section was also designed to compliment and enhance lecture material.",
    "See my response to \"would you recommend this course to another student\"",
    "A strength was that it was very interesting to learn about bio from a big picture perspective. A weakness was at times there was a lot of memorization.",
    "The course goes through a lot of information and is very interesting. Don't really have a critique.",
    "The course was well organized and the problem sets and paper assignments aided in my overall understanding of the material.",
    "Great professor, best taught section of the bio sequence. A strength is having the papers instead of quizzes.",
    "Amazing professor and a really interesting course.",
    "Well organized, could have a better curve",
    "The material is taught in an interesting manner and it is easy to engage with the material in class because it is not very complex material. However there is a lot of details. The final exam did not do as great of a job as the midterm in covering all of the major topics we covered in the second half of the class. The final paper was also very stressful and I felt was not necessary.",
    "This course was fantastic. I liked the clade and trait writing assignment and I loved the marsh\/peabody tours. Prof. Donoghue is also certainly a highlight.",
    "I found the tests to be challenging and some questions were unfair in that I do not remember learning about them. However, the class is interesting. Some of the organization of the material doesn't make sense to me, it was a lot of random organisms and memorization, but overall the class was very instructive.",
    "The course never seemed to come together coherently. Was a lot of random facts just thrown at you.",
    "This course was so good!! This was definitely my favorite out of all the intro bios. The format of the class I think worked really nicely, with research paper readings, the field trip to botanical gardens\/Peabody, and the stretch breaks built into class. Lectures were finally manageable to pay attention to during the whole thing, and the content was always super interesting!",
    "Class paper needs to be better facilitated, it is too specific, very hard to write.",
    "The lectures were always engaging and interesting, balancing detail and breadth, however I think the course could have focused on concepts more than route memorization",
    "Prof Donoghue was really enthusiastic and fun about the stuff that he was teaching and the stretch time in the middle was also really nice to just relax. The only weakness I would say is that the lecture format got kind of tedious after a while... i also loved the tours to the Peabody and Marsh Garden! Good switch up for lecture!",
    "Their could have been more help provided for students apart from lecture.",
    "I think it would've been helpful to give us the solutions to the practice exam posted. What's the point of a practice test if we can't check our answers?",
    "This was an amazing course, and Professor Donoghue truly gave students an appreciation for the vast array of organisms in nature and the clever mechanisms that evolution and selection perfected over the past few billion years. The lectures were always highly organized, with additional facts and knowledge provided for the enjoyment of the students. The problem sets, student papers and publications went along well with the material covered in lecture. The midterm and final were fair. The course was extremely strong overall. I especially loved the visit to the Marsh Botanical Gardens.",
    "Donoghue is a fantastic lecturer, and made presented the material in an interesting way. The two papers weren't too challenging and the tests were very fair.",
    "This course really facilitates student engagement and attention due to the incredibly interesting information and videos discussed in class. A weakness is that the class is heavily based on memorization."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great course taught by a passionate man.",
    "I guess, but since you can only take it with the sequence I'm not sure it's worth it for a non bio\/pre-med student.",
    "Yes, even though it's a required course. I thought it was very interesting, and I learned a good combination of important basic information combined with interesting videos (such as the wasp larvae in the caterpillar) and fun facts. I enjoyed going to class, and feel like I have a better\/solid understand of evolution and ecology concepts now.",
    "I would recommend other ecology and evolutionary bio courses for sure and with professor Donoghue. This class is a part of the bio sequence, which is just so poorly taught at parts that I would not suggest it unless its a requirement.",
    "Yes. I mean, you probably have to take it anyway, but its the best of the four! Have fun! You deserve it after the others!",
    "I would, but mainly because you only take it if you have to.",
    "This course is good. Not great, but good. The material is inherently very interesting, it rekindles the elementary dream to become a veterinarian or a zookeeper or to see a penguin. Every lecture seems to involve some aspect of the animal kingdom and a tie-in to some cool fact. This is not to say that the course lacks anything in science! The material is rigorously cited and sourced from recent journal articles. This is science taught by a scientist. And sometimes that's obvious. Donahue's lecturing ability isn't great, but he seems to enjoy it. The material which would be otherwise \"incredibly engaging\" with another professor is instead \"interesting.\" His slides are clear enough and attendance at lecture really isn't required to do well in the course. Some of the more nitty-gritty details of the methods are quickly distilled and while this may frustrate people who are in this course for the hard-science of biology, it really is fine. The course doesn't offer any significant advantage to those who have taken biology before as many of the questions require knowledge of the specific clades and traits discussed in lecture, not just the general ideas or concepts. There is an advantage, though, to people who know fossil and evolutionary lineages. The origins of fish, birds, and plants feature heavily in the \"evolution\" part of the course. Drawing and memorizing phylogenetic trees is an interesting exercise in a class which is otherwise majority memorization. The course is well-taught and the staff competent. It's required for a bunch of stuff so you should probably take it. But if you are actively looking for a fun bio course this isn't the one. Take E&EB 225 \"Evolutionary Biology\" for harder science evolution and take G&G125 \"History of Life\" for learning about the evolution of the modern animals we come to know and love through BIOL104.",
    "Take it if you have to take it and it will be better than Biol 103, but it's a lot to go through if you're not using it as a prereq for something.",
    "104 is the gem of the bio sequence! I felt that Professor Donoghue presented the content in a much more straightforward way than the Professors in Biol 102 and Biol 103, this made coming to class enjoyable rather than confusing.",
    "It's refreshing to enter Biol104 after the rest of the sequence to observe biology on a macro scale (especially since 102 and 103 are so specific!). I'd recommend this course to someone interested in evolution or plants.",
    "Yes! This is an excellent class taught by an excellent professor! You will have a great time learning about ecology and evolution!",
    "Yes. Best bio sequence class!",
    "yes! definitely take bio 104 in the spring. donoghue is amazing.",
    "Absolutely. This class is very interesting, even for those not particularly inclined toward the sciences.",
    "Even if this course isn't required for your major, Professor Donoghue makes the class interesting, and it's quite easy to follow along in class. The curve is not high since a lot of people tend to do well, but it's a great class nonetheless.",
    "Yes, because it is extremely interesting and the topics are very relatable and important.",
    "Only take if you have to or if you like biology, material was interesting",
    "This course was really enjoyable! I even enjoyed studying for the tests because the material was so interesting. It is by far and large the highlight of the intro bio sequence and something to look forward to. Definitely take the class with Donoghue, as it is much better than with Near. Be warned that the two tests are overwhelming based on simply memorizing the material from the slides, and, if that is a weak point for you or something you hate, you might not enjoy the class very much. Otherwise, this class is really enjoyable. Every lecture was fun and engaging!",
    "Yes. I loved this course. It was very informative and very well taught. A lot of memorization. But worthwhile.",
    "I think this was the best course in the Biology Intro track, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't have to take it or isn't super interested in ecology\/evolution.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course was so enjoyable and interesting, and definitely the highlight of this semester!",
    "Yes. This course was neither content-intensive nor too easy, but I came away with more than enough understanding of key concepts that would allow me to understand primary literature in the field.",
    "Only if required to do so for their major.",
    "Yes! A very well-structured overview of life history and evolutionary principles. You learn about fossils, molecular methods to infer phylogenetic relationships, ecological interactions. Some of the stuff is really fascinating. If you're into theoretical, logical stuff, you'll for sure find the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (a population that is static, without natural evolution) and inferring phylogeny interesting. If you like dates\/history, then you'll enjoy learning about the time scales (eras) of life on earth. But most of all, if you have any sense of fascination at the complexity of modern life, you'll be enchanted by the strange, wonderful species you learn about.",
    "would highly recommend this class to students! Unfortunately, he or she would have to get through 103 first which was very* poorly taught.",
    "Yes! Truly the light at the end of the tunnel of the on-semester bio sequence. I actually enjoyed this class and I had given up on the hell of 101-103.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to learn the basic concepts behind ecology, especially if the course is taught by Prof. Donoghue, who does a wonderful job at explaining various topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and found the information very interesting. Not only for someone who needs to take the course, but for someone who wants to understand how life came to be the way it is. It also makes me very interested in the major.",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Donoghue is one of the best teachers Yale has to offer, and his class was amazing. Each lecture is full of interesting material which keeps the class engaging and fun. I never found myself bored in this class. From the field trips to the final paper, this class is designed for every type of student. If you are deciding between taking the intro bio sequence on or off sequence, I would say take it on sequence just to have Donoghue. The strengths of 104 definitely make up for the disadvantages of 103.",
    "Absolutely! I learned a lot and it was very interesting.",
    "Yes, this is a comprehensive introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology that puts research methods and analysis like phylogenies directly into practice through the weekly assignments.",
    "BIOL104 is often thought of as the least painful module in the sequence, which is true, but beware that the exams require memorizing a lot of very specific details unlike the other modules.",
    "Yess! You have to get through 101-103 to take it which sucks, but it is so interesting and probably the best bio class for non bio major science because it feels a lot more like elementary school bio where you learn cool facts and look at pictures of animals.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to non-STEM people just because you have to go through the whole sequence to get to it, but it was my second favorite of the sequence.",
    "Yes. It's so fun and interesting without sucking up all your time.",
    "I highly recommend this course and the teacher! Very wonderful and interesting",
    "Yes. This is by far the best class in the biology sequence because it is taught in a way to make it interesting (not painful) to students. Even people leas interested in evolutionary biology will like this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Michael Donoghue was so fantastic that even though I am premed, I found myself completely fascinated by his lectures on plants and tiny organisms!",
    "I have already recommended this course to many students.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 104. Unlike other BIOL students, 104 was not my favorite, but I really did like the teacher and his way of explaining things. I think this is truly biology for the beginner, which is nice because we were able to get really in-depth on topics because the instructor assumed that we didn't know anything on the topic and could offer some clear sentences in explanation. The course is good, but it is not super easy in my opinion--still a lot to know and to memorize typical of a BIOL sequence course, and so I would still remain on top of your game.",
    "As one of the intro bio modules, you'll probably only take this course if it's required or might be required for your major. It's...fine. Professor Donoghue does a pretty good job of crafting a compelling story during his lectures so that it's more interesting and organized and you can see how everything is connected-- in terms of material and in terms of ecology and evolution! The slides are also pretty nice and good to study from. But we had to know a lot of seemingly unimportant details about random groups of species, which didn't seem interesting or necessary to me. As a result, there was a lot of memorization involved in studying for the midterm and final (ie. memorizing phylogenies and examples of specific concepts, rather than applying the concepts themselves on the exam), which wasn't my cup of tea, and it seemed like the exams were not really testing our understanding but rather our ability to regurgitate everything from the slides. The two problem sets early on were useful in testing our understanding of phylogenies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and were good practice for the midterm. The final paper (5 pages on a trait and clade), however, seemed kind of pointless. A few of the papers we read for section were interesting, and somewhat easier than the ones we read for other modules.",
    "I would recommend this course! By far the best of the intro bio sequence. The material was taught very interestingly and I learned a lot of thing we typically would not learn in an intro bio course.",
    "Yes it is very interesting and provides a great explanation of past life on Earth.",
    "it's the light at the end of the tunnel that is the intro bio sequence -- take it w donoghue!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student since it was an interesting introduction to the evolutionary history of life.",
    "This is the best part of the bio sequence",
    "Yes, it was not much work and was really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel that I learned a lot about the diversity of life and have a greater understanding of the value of ecology and evolution.",
    "If you need intro bio",
    "Yes but no because you would have to go through the rest of the bio series.",
    "Yes! This class is fantastic even if you don't need to take it as a requirement for anything.",
    "If you are interested in ecology or have to for a major, definitely take it. It's an interesting class and a good break from the other material presented in the intro bio sequence.",
    "No",
    "You have to take all of intro bio to get to this class so maybe not... but ecology and evolutionary biology is a really interesting subject so take classes in that department!",
    "Yes if you are interested in it.",
    "Yes especially if you have a love for biology, this course embraces that instead of scaring you away from the subject",
    "Yeah! I would recommend it, it would be fun to get a overview of ecology and evolutionary bio, it was one of the more fun parts of the biology sequence",
    "This was a very interesting and engaging course and I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I found this class to be very interesting. I really enjoyed learning the material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in evolutionary biology, or anyone looking for a (half) science credit.",
    "Yes, by far my favorite module of the intro bio sequence",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if they do not study biology or are not pre-med, just to take a fun and interesting science class. It teaches you a lot about the history of humans and life on Earth, and I think it is knowledge that is important for everyone to know.",
    "Hands-down the best class in the biology sequence. The professor was much better than the other three and really seemed to understand his students and how college students functioned."
