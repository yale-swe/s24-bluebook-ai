   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are interested in children's policy issues, especially with regards to foster care, adoption, abuse, and neglect. And take it especially if you are interested in a career in law or policy, particularly pro bono work. You will undoubtedly come away from the class with a whole lot more common sense and apt legal reasoning skills.",
    "take it if you can get in!",
    "Definitely one of the best classes I have ever taken. Any Dufresne course is an absolute must-take for anyone interested in law, because you not only learn law but you also learn how to practice it. Also, her HW assignments are probably the most unique and creative of any class at Yale. Exactly how it should be done - not just boring weekly responses, but assignments that make you use different parts of your brain. They're challenging, but extremely rewarding. Another strength of this course was the people around me. If your classmates are anything like mine, they will all be extremely intelligent and will have extremely interesting things to day. This is probably the only class I've taken where nearly every hand was in the air at times, and not merely for participation's sake. Every time someone spoke, it made a concrete and novel contribution.",
    "Strengths: Take this class if you are interested in Children's Law and Policy, but more importantly take this class because Professor Dufresne is THAT good. Even if you are not considering law school, take this class. The discussions are really thought provoking; there is no bs. Not only will you come out of this class understanding more about Children's laws and policies, but an even better understanding about how law and policies might be discussed and argued more generally. Professor Dufresne will bring her work experiences to the class, which is great. She also cares about her students A LOT, and will offer to every student career\/internship advice and is a great reference. All in all, hands down one of the best, if not the best, class I took at Yale.Weaknesses: Be prepared to do lots of work in this class--work will alternate on a weekly basis between a written assignment that will take at least 5 hours every other week and a small group discussion. There's a policy recommendation in the end, as well as a final exam. The hours might seem more than other classes, but it is so worth it. Professor Dufresne is very fair about her grading; she knows it's a lot of work and recognizes when you put in effort. You'll get accustomed to the workload by the end of the month. If you are really concerned, take it CR\/D first to see how you manage in the beginning, and switch later.",
    "CLP was a ton of work, but a lot of fun and you definitely get out what you put in. Professor Dufresne is incredible - if you can take a course with her, absolutely do. The grading is fair and reflects the effort you put in. Take it if you're ready for the work!",
    "This is absolutely the best class I have taken at Yale. However, I have also never worked harder for a class. This work was absolutely worth it because I am passionate about the material and wanted to see whether I could handle the work load of law school but it is important to consider how much you want to put into this class and consider taking it Cr\/D if you don't have the time to commit to it.",
    "Amazing. Best class at Yale. Lot's of work.",
    "Great class if you are interested in the law at all and if you are willing to put in the work.",
    "A must-take if you're at all interested in any aspect of the title (even if it's just children, or just law, or just policy). It was probably the most thought-provoking course I've ever taken, while at the same time extremely practical (you learn important real-world, especially legal, skills).",
    "This is an incredible course. It is a lot of work, and the assignments are the gist of the power of this course. If you cannot handle the course load, you won't get much out of this course! If you can, and if you get in, absolutely take it. Even if you are not planning to go to law school (speaking from experience), don't be deterred or feel that you don't have a chance of getting in - Professor DuFresne advocates for a diversity of academic backgrounds and experiences to help engender a more rich debate without differing viewpoints and perspectives. You will learn so much. You'll learn how to use evidence to formulate an argument, and you'll start to see that it's very difficult to decide that one side is \"right\" and the other is \"wrong\" after seeing the issue from multiple perspectives. Professor DuFresne will make you realize that even when you think you've placed all the puzzle pieces together, there's another way to look at the issue that complicates it further, which you'll learn how to account for. You'll learn equally as much from your fellow classmates, who Professor DuFresne chooses impeccably, as they are all brilliant and introduce you to ways of thinking that you hadn't considered. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale by far.",
    "I absolutely loved this course--it was the best I've ever taken at Yale. The topic is enormous, fascinating, and still sort of unsettled and politically contentious, and the course provides a review of a wide variety of really interesting areas: custody, abuse\/neglect, juvenile justice, protection, and representation. Prof. Dufresne is wonderful: a really compelling lecturer and discussion leader who speaks honestly from her own experiences and encourages the group to engage with the tough questions in the material. There's a lot of work, but it's not at all unmanageable if you plan. Take this course--you will learn so much.",
    "A very nice course with a lot of reading and a refreshing variety of assignments! A real emphasis on practicality, which is unusual for a Yale course.",
    "It might sound like hyperbole, but this is truly the best course I have ever taken at Yale. Wonderful professor, engaging class sessions with variety from week to week, and a great group of other students in the class. I haven't had many classes before where I felt like I really made new friends in the course, but Professor Dufresne really makes sure everyone has a chance to interact with each other in group assignments outside of class -- and the group assignments aren't annoying, frustrating \"group projects\" either. Tough, demanding work -- the most I've ever had for a class -- but totally worth it. The material is very interesting, and there's something for everyone. Professor Dufresne is so good that you'll want to do the work, and then do even more work to make sure what you submit is your best effort. The course helped direct me toward taking a law-related job after graduation, and I'm now seriously considering law school in a few years.",
    "TAKE IT! She's a goddess (she's brilliant, on top of her stuff, facilitates amazing discussion, and gives the most creative assignments), and the class is phenomenal. Best class I've taken at Yale. Still, if you're not going to do the reading, don't take it. It's a lot of reading (albeit very engrossing material) and you have weekly (small) assignments. The final is extremely difficult. If you don't study, you're screwed. Even if you study, it's rough. BUT SUCH A REWARDING COURSE!"
