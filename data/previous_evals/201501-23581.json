    "Class was great! Too much reading! I like the Coastal Governance book but journal articles were too much. Perhaps around 20 pages for a class is doable.",
    "For those of us interested in policy issues, this is precisely the kind of class that FES needs more of. Rick has an unparalleled level of understanding and expertise in coastal governance issues and is able to draw parallels across different disciplines and provide in-depth anecdotes and examples for almost every topic covered. His ability to train students to become better policy analysts is really fantastic. I wish there were more courses that adopted frameworks like his.",
    "The readings were too much in my opinion, half way through the semester I couldn't keep up anymore - I think all of the readings were important though, so I don't think cutting them would be good, maybe just highlighting which readings we should do closely and which we can do less closely? Having a point person for each reading to present and go in depth was great."

    "I thought the structure of the course was great - an introduction to the various sectors relevant to coastal governance, followed by a deeper look at fisheries. The fisheries conference was useful and I enjoyed the opportunity to choose a fishery of interest to me in writing my paper and preparing a presentation for the class. Overall, I thought the course was great.",
    "Rick's knowledge and experience. His ability to draw on past and current examples of what we were discussing and his ability to synthesize information across a broad range of disciplines for students.",
    "The course was small (8 students), which made for very interesting discussion. I enjoyed the discussion-based format of the course a lot.",
    "I loved the fisheries conference and the fisheries paper we wrote at the end of the course. It really gave us the opportunity to put all of the readings we had done to good use, and apply the theories to real-world problems in fisheries management. The set-up of the course, in which we read and discussed papers which could then be used for our final paper was an excellent approach.",
    "I learned a huge amount about coastal issues, but also broader concepts like stakeholder involvement, the policymaking process, regulation and implementation."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Although I liked the idea of students leading discussions on occasion, I would have preferred that each student led one or two classes, rather than two or three to leave more days for discussions lead by the professor, especially given his great insights as someone directly involved in coastal governance. I thought fewer assigned readers would have had greater impact. I generally find that focusing on a few articles that everyone reads carefully leads to better discussions and improved understanding.",
    "The \"student-led discussion\" model is really popular at FES, sometimes too popular. Though I appreciate the value in being asked to present on a paper to the rest of the class, this is a risky approach to learning because you can't guarantee other students will be able to explain the material well. Plus, Rick knows so much that student-led discussions were only valuable when he had a hand in guiding them. He was good about stepping in where there were blanks to fill in from student presentations, but I wish that more time in the course was devoted directly to hearing from Rick.",
    "There were a lot of readings assigned every week, and I had difficulty getting through all of them (as did other students that I have spoken with). I think that it would help in discussion if there were slightly fewer readings, which would enable students to do a closer reading of assigned articles\/text.",
    "There was too much reading to do for the course, to the point that the number of readings per week was overwhelming, and almost discouraging, because one person could not possibly read them all. I think a better approach might be to focus more on a central reading (like the textbook) and then seed readings from there, rather than placing so much emphasis on so many different papers.",
    "If I think back to the very first introductory class, I think it would be great to emphasize that there is a focus on concepts (stakeholder involvement, spatial planning etc.) as well as the content matter of coastal issues. That was a very valuable part of the class for me, and I don't remember being aware of that when the class was introduced (though maybe my memory is flaky)."

    "I am constantly seeking more policy-relevant courses at FES. Obviously this class was useful for anyone interested in coastal or ocean management issues, but generally a fantastic piece of interdisciplinary coursework that teaches a way of thinking about issues that all students here at school would benefit from.",
    "I am studying water resources management, and I focus on coastal management and fisheries. This course was directly applicable to my area of interest, and I would definitely recommend it to other students interested in coastal management.",
    "For those of us who are interested in marine and coastal management at this school (there are very few of us, but we DO exist), this course is SO IMPORTANT for us. There are no other courses like it, and it really is a way to introduce us to the problems\/solutions that marine planners face daily around the world. This might have been the most helpful and important class I will have taken for my professional career while at FES."

I wish that we would have had time to dive deeper into each of the various sectors that we discussed briefly - e.g., oil and gas drilling, dredging, wetlands conservation, etc. - or that there were more courses offered at F&ES on coastal and marine topics. Given time constraints though, I think the structure of the course was ideal. The course touched on all the major areas of coastal governance that I expected it to.",
    "Exceeded! Did not realize what a fantastically interdisciplinary class this would be.",
    "Yes. I learned to look at coastal management issues from a policy and governance perspective that integrates policy\/governance theories with knowledge of coastal resources. I feel better equipped now to pursue a career focusing on coastal management; I am confident in my ability to discuss the efficacy of various policies and how they relate to coastal management.",

    "Take it, but only if you are comfortable with interdiscplinary thought and have good analytic\/synthetic skills. Otherwise I could see the class being more of a challenge.",
    "Do the readings, but really focus your attention on the class discussions. This is where you will get your best ideas for the paper at the end of the course. Choose your paper topic on a fishery that you have a vested interest in, because by the end of the course, you will know more about it than you ever thought possible.",
    "Don't hesitate to ask the professor anything, even if it seems unrelated to the readings - many of the very insightful discussions we had in class were inspired by broader questions of politics, the legal system, careers in policymaking etc."
