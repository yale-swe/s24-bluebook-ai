    "Same as last semester. The best speakers this semester were not Yale professors who came and spoke about their research -- most of them we had already heard of, and most of their talks were fairly boring. Some of the other speakers from outside Yale, however, were outstanding -- I loved hearing form the Liberian doctor who survived Ebola and the ex-MSF coordinator who was researching management consulting in health. I hope next year the class can have more speakers like them and relies less on Yale researchers.",
    "Really good seminar! I like the themes of the modules this semester and the design thinking focus at the end of the course was really interesting.",
    "Loved it, learned a lot.",
    "The course was an interesting overview of topics in global health with interesting speakers",
    "Some great lecturers this semester.",
    "The doctor was a part of the recent Ebola epidemic was the best speaker of not only the semester, but the entire year. He should come back next year!",
    "I like that the course allows for two absences as it acknowledges the other commitments students may have. I like that we have guest lectures. I think if possible it would be great to allow more small group discussions focused on case studies. I really liked the way the last class was structured because we had the opportunity to engage with an issue and try to identify existing resources to find a solution to a global health issue.",
    "Awesome!",
    "I liked the diversity of speakers this semester and the innovation module. I wish we had more interactive sessions throughout the semester.",
    "There must be another way to engage students more.",
    "more engaging speakers and more collective student input to assess interests",
    "Most of the topics were interesting.",
    "Very informative.",
    "I enjoyed some of the lectures more than others. For example, I really liked the lecture about Management Consulting. I did not like that an entire lecture was devoted to Ruchit's work - he is very idolized at YSPH and so I have heard about his work on numerous occasions (including about 20 min of another lecture). This was too much in my opinion, especially since there wasn't even any real data to talk about to tell whether it works. I would've gotten a lot more out of hearing a seasoned professional give a talk.",
    "This seminar exposes students to a wide range of global health topics and professionals. The greatest strength is the relaxed atmosphere that allows students to learn about new areas without the pressure of a formal classroom experience."

    "Cool lectures and free food! What's not to like?",
    "Loved it, everyone interested in global health should take it.",
    "Good introductory class for global health students",
    "Take it if you are interested in global health, but also get involved in other places.",
    "If you haven interest in global health, take it.",
    "Each class will have a different energy. Its good to look in advance to see who is presenting so you can perhaps prepare questions for those whose work align with your own interests.",
    "A great lecture series!",
    "This is a great introduction to a broad view of global health. I would recommend this course because it expanded my understanding of global health and gave me some insight into possible trajectories for the future.",
    "Very passive course. Take it to fulfill the global health concentration requirements.",
    "Interesting to sit in on and learn about a variety of topics. It requires minimal effort on your part and you get a free dinner out of it.",
    "Most of the topics were interesting and I enjoyed it.",
    "The topics covered are broad and informative.",
    "Highly recommend even if not global health student. Review the topics and guest lecturers for interests.",
    "Some of the lectures are better than others. You have to do it if you want the GH concentration. And if you don't, might be worth it for you to attend, especially if you are more policy minded."
