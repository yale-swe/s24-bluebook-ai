It is tons of work to learn useless information that you weren't even rewarded for understanding because the partial credit is so stingy. They expect you to read their minds and know how they want you to explain things on tests and homeworks. If you can avoid it, do not take this course. Just so you know the logistics, it's weekly psets, 2 midterms and a final.",
