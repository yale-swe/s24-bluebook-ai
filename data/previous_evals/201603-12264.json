    "We may need more materials (e.g. notes, slides). Other things are perfect.",
    "rich content but lack of organization, hope to provide lecture notes.",
    "Sekhar covered a large number of topics and is an engaging, encouraging, and knowledgeable instructor. The course could have been improved with a teaching fellow to assist Sekhar with the grading, for quicker feedback on the problem sets (though I suppose graduate courses are less structured). Despite this, Sekhar always finds time to meet with students to review topics.",
    "I prefer a bit more applied focus, with real datasets and demonstration of useful tools for the analysis and then backing up to the theory of why what your method worked and why it's believable.",
    "Strengths: The class expose students to different kinds of graphical models. Weakness: The lecture speed is very fast, and students who haven't never seen the materials might find it hard to follow.",
    "I think there are too many contents included in this course and it is not easy for beginners to follow. However, it is really great to help you to review what you knew in graphical models."
