    "ENGL114 was a very enjoyable course. Michael does a great job structuring the course to get students to understand and challenge the myths of California. He is very good at teaching his students how to write and how to think about writing for academic purposes. His comments on essays were always helpful. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic because its a very interesting and well structured method of reading, analyzing, and writing scholarly research essays.",
    "Definitely recommend for all freshman!! English 114 is a great intro class that gives you a really strong foundation for any academic writing you will pursue in the future. You learn techniques of analytical writing that you can literally apply to any essay -- I started applying it to the essays I wrote for every other class in the middle of my the semester. The 4 different types of papers give you a little taste of anything, and they really help you through the process. Just be sure that you are interested in the theme of the class, otherwise it can get sort of boring or a bit dry.",
    "I would recommend it depending on what type of essay you like to write. If you're not into personal narratives the class is good and you learn a lot about California. Overall the class was really fun and makes you see California from a different perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone looking to improve his or her writing in a short period of time. It may be a lot of work but it certainly pays off.",
    "English 114 is a great seminar class that will improve your writing of academic and research papers. It will give you many perspectives on the history and social structure of California. I would definitely recommend this class for another student, especially if he or she is from California.",
    "I think 114 is very good for students who are not very interested in literature, and who may need help really working on there writing structure. I would not recommend it for those who really enjoy delving into a story and analyzing it, because it is a very structures class about presentation, not story.",
    "English 114 was a very good course, but it probably depends on if you like your section topic or not. Because I very much enjoyed the material that I was reading and writing about, it made it much easier to put time and effort into the course, which helped my writing.",
    "Great intro to college writing. Take it on a topic you care about. I suspect it would get old fast otherwise. It has a medium workload, but again, the readings are fun if they are on a topic you find interesting."
