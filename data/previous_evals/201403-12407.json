    "Take this class with Sarab if you really want to learn the language. She is by no means an \"easy\" professor, but she is a great teacher. The class is pretty rigorous, homework every night, even through reading period, but you learn a lot.",
    "It's a lot of work, but you learn a lot in a short amount of time. It's a rich and beautiful language. Yes, I would recommend the class.",
    "Intro Arabic is difficult, but you won't be alone. The professor will be there to help you, not only to help you learn the language, but also the culture (an often overlooked, but very important detail). I would recommend it to someone interested in learning another language, but not to someone just looking for an easy A.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in Arabic or have some kind of background with it. I like to take languages on a whim, but not all people are like that.",
    "ARBC 110 is very time-consuming and the grammar is ridiculously frustrating, but it's definitely do-able and worthwhile (again, if you have the time and patience). If you give the course the time it demands and get a tutor, you can surely pass with flying colors and (more importantly if you're really interested in learning the language) have a decent amount of vocabulary in your pocket by the end of the semester.",
    "Wow, this class was incredibly hard, but totally worth it. I learned an incredible amount and can read (very slowly) paragraphs of what used to gibberish. A friend before I took the class told me not to take it unless I woke up every morning with the firm conviction I wanted to learn Arabic. I offer that same piece of advice to all of you. A few things that are frustrating\/You should know about the class... 1. Lots of heritage speakers who go in the class with a big background in it - don't worry about them. 2. An ungodly amount of work at the beginning of the semester. Don't worry, this lets up by the end October where the class becomes much more manageable. 3. Hard tests but lots of free points: This means that you'll bomb the tests, but don't worry about it too much because you'll get free points from homework. 4. Very strict attendance policy. 5. Take it with Sarab! I took it Credit\/D because I didn't need to fulfill my language requirement. You might want to do so too!",
    "Dont be put off by the bad rep Yales Arabic Dept has gotten over the years, I really think it has improved (probably because they got Sarab). While you do have to put work in, I feel like I learned a lot in L1. One thing that could be improved is the amount of Levantine dialect that we learn. Its nice that we have a section to study it, but more class time would be helpful as well, considering that it is more useful in conversation than MSA. I recommend trying to get Sarab if you can. She's a great teacher and really cares about students understanding the language."
