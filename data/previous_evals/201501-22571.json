    "430 was an excellent course, especially if DeMille teaches it again, and if the flipped classroom is maintained. (For reference, when I refer to a flipped classroom I mean that we read the textbook...Griffiths of course...at home and spend class time answering clicker questions in groups with other students.) I certainly learned quite a substantial amount from this course, specifically because I was able to debate the clicker questions with the other students in my group, forcing me to question my own reasoning. These groups also help with the homework; my group always did psets the Tuesday night before they were due, and it typically took us about 8 hours doing it all together. The class is fair, though be warned that DeMille purposely makes the midterm very long and difficult in order to spread out the grade distribution. He tried for a median of 60, and I think that's around what happened. Anyway, it's certainly doable (I haven't seen the final yet though!) and I would recommend it for other physics majors. I would even suggest it for non-intensive physics majors who may be interested in EM. Also, it's nice to take with friends because we got to form our own groups!",
    "Overall, the course turned out well. If one plans on taking it, one better ensure early on in the term to have a firm grasp on vector calculus (differentiation and integrals), as almost all of the math in the entire course is based on vector theorems and relations. The material was interesting and motivated well by Professor DeMille, who was almost always able to offer a satisfying conceptual explanation along with the math, when there was one to be had (curse the vector potential!). I recommend that future students find a study group early on, as many homework problems require figuring out a clever trick, and if you can't get it you may end up stuck for a while. Definitely recommended if you're interested in these fundamental topics in physics!",
    "This class is good, not great. De Mille is as good as professor as you could hope for, but E&M is boring as shit. I suspect some of the comments will be whining about the flipped-classroom structure of this class, but personally, I found it a big improvement over the traditional lecture format. It didn't let me space out and fall behind in the way I often do in lecture courses, because I had to be prepared to do problems in class every day. And let's be honest, most of the actual learning in these classes happens when you do the reading and the problem sets anyway, so I'm glad the format provided an impetus to get them done before lecture. The problem sets were harder than I expected. About 10 hours of sometimes tedious algebra every week. Some difficult algebra is to be expected in E&M, but I felt like DeMille sometimes intentionally selected the problems in Griffiths that required more tedious computation than I found reasonable. We also had to prove lots of theorems in the homework, something I never have found productive. I think this class would benefit from modernizing itself the way 410 has: by moving beyond the boring questions in Griffiths and including some more interesting questions that require some programming or Mathematica to solve. For example, many of the problems involved solving Poisson's equation and Laplace's equation for the potential. Having us plots the solutions as part of the problem would have helped the class seem a bit more 21st century. Because most of the homeworks are from Griffiths, and there are worked solutions online for basically all the problems in Griffiths, most people used solutions manuals to some extent in doing the homeworks, and thus the average grade for homeworks was almost 100 even on very difficult problems. DeMille explicitly told us at the beginning of the course than anyone caught using a solutions manual would be punished, but it's pretty hard to prove people have used the solutions manual even when it must have been obvious. I really wish professors would either 1) make homeworks worth almost nothing to minimize the incentive to use the solutions manual if they don't want students to use them, or 2) write their own damn problems. I know they want to trust in the honesty of their students, but this is largely a futile because students aren't honest. The midterm was a bit annoying because it was designed to be too long to complete in the available 50 minutes. It became little more than an exercise in writing down as many equations as possible without actually solving the problems to maximize partial credit. There's a significant amount of overlap between this class and physics 260. You cover new stuff, like solving Laplace's equation and using the multipole expansion, but if you've had Baltay, it's little more than the standard separation of variables song and dance. You're probably wondering whether you should take this or 402. 402 is probably slightly more interesting, but Let's Be Honest. Ain't nobody going to take you seriously applying for grad school if you don't take a full semester of E&M and another of Thermo. Take this.",
    "Really cool class but VERY challenging \/ time consuming. If you want to understand the cool concepts prepare to put in a lot of time for psets and review.",
    "Really good class. DeMille is awesome and really responsive to student feedback. The pacing of the course was pretty wonky this year -- the second half of the semester covered about twice the material of the first -- but I'm sure DeMille will fix that (it was his first year teaching E&M). Exams were quite difficult.",
    "PHYS 430 was a well taught class. The first part of the class moved fairly slowly, but was also the more difficult part of the class. The last part of the class moved very fast and was difficult to keep up with.",
    "The best taught physics class I have taken at Yale. The text book is very good. In class, rather than simply copying down notes from the board, we had interactive sessions: we solved problems together and spend time discussing subtleties in the material. I grew very close to my classmates. Sure, this teaching style meant reading the textbook outside of class, but I do that anyways when I start working on the p-set. I also realized that it is a waste of time to come to class and copy down notes, especially when the textbook is excellent or the professor can post his notes online. I sincerely hope other physics class will follow this teaching model. Problem sets are hard, but don't consume your soul. Usually, they give you a lot of insight into the material. Exams are hard but fair.",
    "PHYS430 is a relatively math-heavy treatment of typical topics in E&M; a lot of time was spent on electrostatics, so the rest felt a bit rushed. DeMille is one of the best instructors in the department--definitely take it, but be prepared for long-ish psets and difficult exams, but also very interesting material.",
    "If you get the chance to take E&M with DeMille, grab it. You are in excellent hands. If you are struggling with the material, DeMille always makes time to see you. If you are finding it too easy, DeMille will provide you with material to take your understanding further. Recommend without hesitation.",
    "Unless you're taking it for the major, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Most of the material was already covered in PHYS 201. The only interesting part was the relativistic formulation and you spend a week on it.",
    "Take this with DeMille if you can! He is a great teacher. It's a lot of work, but it is essential for a physics student. Weekly psets (13 total, since we got one during reading week), a midterm, and a final. Exams are hard, but curved reasonably.",
    "Reasonable. I learned a lot about EM. DeMille is a nice professor.",
    "A semester of electric and magnetic fields in a vacuum and in matter. Also, waves and relativistic E and M.",
    "It's hard. It's really hard. It's true that I learned a lot more in PHYS 430 than in any other physics class I've taken at Yale. Still, I feel like this might have been the worst grade I ever got. The fact that we spent a long time in the first few chapters, and then ran through everything else in Griffiths after Spring Break didn't help much, but I think we all understand that it was the first time that Professor DeMille was teaching this class. We had a flipped classroom. Some loved it, some hated it. I must say that it helped me learn, but I wish we had had more digestible amounts of readings, so I could actually keep up with it by the end of the semester. The video lectures we had to watch are not really helpful to be honest. Despite minor problems and the fact that exams killed everyone, I feel like Professor DeMille is probably the best professor I had in the Department of Physics so far; he's extremely dedicated to making sure his students understand everything. The class is hard, but also excellent.",
    "Absolutely, PHYS 430 is a phenomenal class my favorite this semester. If you want to see electricity and magnetism presented at a sophisticated level and are up for a (manageable) challenge, I would recommend this class without hesitation. Professor DeMille is moreover an outstanding professor, and I would highly recommend taking the class if he is teaching it. He is extremely thoughtful and approachable, willing and eager to help students and answer questions. Hes also very clear and organized in presenting the material and answering questions and does a really good job explaining challenging concepts in simple ways. Although initially I wasnt sure how the flipped classroom strategy would work, I think Professor DeMille did a fantastic job with it; he still reviewed essentially all of the material in class, which I really appreciated, but encouraging us to learn first from the textbook allowed for more time to cover examples and problems during class, and I found the in-class exercises and Professor DeMilles insights in solving them to be very helpful in reinforcing the material. Similarly, I found the problem sets he assigned to be sensibly challenging and very effective in reinforcing the material. Exceptional class and exceptional professor Id highly recommend it.",
    "Electricity and Magnetism is a hard subject - I would argue that it is, with respect to content, one of the hardest physics classes required for undergraduates. Especially if you are taking this course as a sophomore, you are going to struggle. If you're looking into the class, you're probably a physics major of some kind and you're probably required to take it, so what I say doesn't really matter. But for what it's worth, Professor DeMille is very enthusiastic about E&M and very responsive to students' opinions, so I found him to be a good professor of a less-than-enjoyable subject. Expect challenging 8-10 hour p-sets weekly, in addition to assigned readings for each class (which you can get by without doing - or at least I did, with mixed results), so beware if you're already planning a packed semester. Find friends to do p-sets with or else. Godspeed.",
    "This course turned out to be more interesting than I expected. I actually liked how it was taught. Reading the textbook chapters before the class seemed more useful than simply going over what is already in the textbook during the class time. The instructor was very approachable and did a very good job preparing for the lectures."
