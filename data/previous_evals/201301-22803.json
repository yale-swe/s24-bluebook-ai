    "I would definitely recommend this course for someone interested in the subject matter. This class covers a very specific topic, which makes it great for someone who wants to spend a significant amount of time with modernist spanish poets. Some great, unique reading and interesting discussion.",
    "SPAN 306 covers a huge variety of Spanish poets, which was great because I didn't like some of them very much, and we didn't have to spend a lot of time on them. What was made priority in this class was how the poetry connected across poets and across time, rather than the individual poets. I really liked that concept because it made it feel more worthwhile than just studying one person so closely. It gave the poetry and the class a feeling of interconnectedness.I would recommend SPAN 306 to another student who really loves Spanish and is proficient. It was rather intimidating at the start having not had a Spanish Literature class available to me in high school, and also being in a small class where discussion was unavoidable and two of my classmates had clearly studied abroad several times. If that doesn't scare you away, go for it because it's an excellent challenge.",
    "Yes! If you're into poetry and you like to be intellectually challenged while reading and discussing some of the best works of the best poets in the Spanish language take this course!",
    "SPAN 306 is an overview of Spanish modernist poets, from Becquer to Jimenez and Lorca, amongst many others. It's a really enjoyable class, with a relatively light work-load. Professor Harkema is delightful. Highly recommended!"
