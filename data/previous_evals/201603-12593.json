   "comments": [
    "Focus is very medical and animal-oriented -- I don't feel that it covered the full scope of genetic model systems and genetic techniques. Papers were not always relevant to lecture material. Topics were taught in a strange order -- It was a little odd that we were taught genomics and more modern sequencing approaches before we were taught mosaic analysis and other much older techniques. Discussion sections did not evaluate or even discuss the papers very much.",
    "Different topics with the development history involved to provide a clear logic",
    "weakness - the order of the lectures didn't seem to make sense; some of the historical papers and lectures was all on information it seems like most people would have picked up in undergrad; teaching more about current applications of genetics would have been more helpful",
    "The discussion section was way too big, and made it difficult for all to participate. Also, I wish there was a bigger focus on more modern experiments as opposed to the classic experiments from the 90s.",
    "I have learned most of the traditional genetics, such as forward genetic screen, epistasis analysis, transgenic animal and mosaic analysis in college. Therefore learning these things again seems a little repetitive. I would suggest introducing more about GWAS and human genetics. Also, the synopsis before every discussion is a lot of work, yet it is not very helpful in improving our understanding of the paper, and we seldom receive feedback regarding the synopsis.",
    "I very much liked the take home questions in this course.",
    "Strength, multiple faculty for one course.",
    "I think the professors had very different styles of lecturing and discussing. Especially for discussing I think it would be nice to find a consensus on how it is going to be so that we can get the most out of every session.",
    "The sections with the professors were always extremely rewarding. The continuity of lectures between professors wasn't always the best, and some problem sets (and its grading) didn't seem clear.",
    "Weaknesses: A couple of faculties were deeply engaged with the students and the course, while some faculties weren't."
