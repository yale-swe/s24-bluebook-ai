Learned about some of the things not to do in terms of research, such as plagiarism and messing with results. In all, received a broad overview of what being a good researcher means and how to do it in addition to getting exposure to what not to do and the negative results that come with it."

    "I liked that we had group discussions on the topics. It was much more engaging than being lectured all the time. Also the few sessions that were lectured, had interesting stories behind them",
    "It's an important course that isn't always engaging. Some lecturers spend more time on having discussions with students than others who merely lecture from slides. An ethics course is best presented as a discussion, and for the most part the course meets that expectation.",
    "Very great course!",
    "We did what we had to do and they gave us snacks. No complaints here.",
    "some lectures\/discussions were repeats of the sessions we had during matriculation. feel that the whole course can be carried out as a one day workshop to save time on transportation.",
    "I think that this course did a really good job for what it was supposed to be. Every lecture was engaging and insightful. I think that it should continue as it currently stands."

    "They have to",
    "Yes, I think it was a great way to receive exposure into what real research is and how to conduct it. I think that it gives you the details that many people leave out and can help you in the future with your graduate studies where you will be living it out. I think that it was very nice to hear some stories from the different faculty members that they used as learning experiences and that we can use before we reach that part of our research careers."
