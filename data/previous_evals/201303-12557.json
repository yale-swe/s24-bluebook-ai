    "Excellent course with intriguing course material and insightful Professors",
    "This is a great class. While the tests are mainly memorization, the class itself teaches things in an applicable manner.",
    "Very basic class. Everything you need to know is presented in an organized layout on the slides. That being said, lecture is entertaining because it does cover the field of human emotion broadly and completely. Gruber is a bit of a narcotic lecturer, as in she believes in following certain basic lecture traditions, such as no taking pictures on your phone or tablet of the lecture slides. But the lectures make sense and are applicable to everyday life.",
    "Yes, but I hope that the class would be restructured to include fewer listy memorization material.",
    "I would not recommend Psychology 131 to another student, especially if they have already taken intro psych. It was just a drag to sit in lecture although the readings were interesting. Could have skipped every lecture and still gotten the same grade...",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yale student. Solid class--interesting material that is useful for life\/understanding yourself and other people, pretty straightforward format. Lectures are very organized and easy to follow, tests are very fair and not too difficult or too easy. Response questions to lectures are due every class, but they're quick and easy if you go to lecture. The paper\/outreach project are also nice assignments to learn a bit more without being overly stressful. Overall, a solid psych class I'd recommend to anyone, from a freshman to a psych major.",
    "YES! This was an absolutely fantastic psych course. The three in class exams (25% each) were simple and straightforward as long as you had memorized the lecture slides. The lectures by Professor Gruber and the associate TF were well organized and easy to follow. The 15 critical responses (15% of the grade) were a little annoying but I ended up learning a lot just answering them regularly. The outreach project and research paper (5% + 5%) were fun to do! TAKE THIS CLASS if it is offered again!",
    "it's fun and easy. you don't need to go to lecture, just read the slides and you'll do fine on the tests. there are reading responses for every class which actually isn't as annoying as you'd think.",
    "I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a class to complement a tough schedule, because it's interesting and not very hard.",
    "I would recommend this class as there is a bit of work, but you ultimately learn so much! The lectures are intriguing and I loved the guest lecturers as well!",
    "It's a good class to take because it's fairly easy but still interesting. Readings aren't that long, and homework consists of emailing in two short paragraphs based on the reading and lecture. The information is all provided in power points, which makes studying easy. The tests require a lot of memorization of lists, but that's manageable if you put enough time in. I wish tests were more concept based though. I would recommend it!",
    "No section",
    "Average psych class.",
    "If you study the slides for the exam it's a really easy course. Take it is you are interested in Psychology or if you are looking for a fifth course to take.",
    "Neat class helping understand psychological aspects with very little background in psychology. Yes I would recommend this course",
    "Human Emotion is exactly what it sounds like - a survey of how and why we study human emotions. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology, whether or not you have taken Intro Psych. It's interesting and not too difficult if you're willing to do the readings and go to lecture.",
    "Won't be taught again or at least not in the same way since Gruber is leaving after this year. It's a good course, easy if you're a Psych major because you've probably already heard of most of the studies. Kind of a lot of work for a lecture, though... you need to submit two 2-page reading responses per week. Tests aren't too bad and are worth 75% of your grade, which is awesome because they aren't even cumulative.",
    "This class provided a lot of interesting insight about the psychology of human emotions as well as emotions in animals. We learned everything ranging from the history and theories of emotions to their functions, how to manage them, and more!I would recommend this class to a fellow student, even if they're not on the psychology track, as it is super interesting and fun, and the readings aren't long.",
    "This is an awesome class that I would definitely recommend to anyone. The lectures are super interesting, the teachers are really accessible, and the workload isn't bad. I took it Credit\/D and didn't try that hard, but if you are willing to put in the study time, getting an A would definitely be possible.",
    "Psychology 131 is a in-depth over-view of the psychology sub-field affective science. I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an extra social science credit. the information is interesting and applicable to everyone, regardless of your major. The workload isn't demanding, and, in fact, I enjoyed the weekly responses and the small outreach project.",
    "A weak intro class. Avoid if possible--there's much better in this department (i.e. any other 100-level course). Material is fairly interesting, but lectures are incredibly dry, and the only reason anyone goes is to collect mandatory lecture questions that aren't posted online (which strikes me as being poor sport on the part of Professor Gruber--you shouldn't need to threaten students to make them attend lecture). Tests are 100% pure memorization and will account for 75% of your grade.It is an easy A, though, if you study for 6-8 hours before each midterm and spend 8-10 hours on your outreach project. And if you don't go to lectures, that's around 30 hours of work for a Yale credit--not a bad deal. Still, I'd recommend any other introductory psych course over this one.",
    "Solid psych course for psych and non-psych majors alike.",
    "While shopping the course they made it seem like it would be a fun and interactive\/interesting class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.opposite of that. The professor was hostile and distant. The main TA (Devlin) was terrible yet was allowed to lead way too often. The actual material was interesting but they did a horrendous job lecturing. Also, the \"Expert Interviews\" were a waste of time. I took the course because I love psychology but I have friends that took it because they thought it would be a solid gut. That was NOT the case. The TAs were really hard graders and the three exams were intense. Overall, I wish I had dropped this class. Don't waste your time, ESPECIALLY if its being offered at 9am again.Don't take this course, that's my advice to you.",
    "The material is interesting, especially toward the end of the class. Overall? Not worth your time and money. Not even slightly. Taught poorly, graded stupidly, and conveys far less information than the average Yale class. Professor Gruber is a lousy lecturer, and a number of the lectures were given by one of her PhD students.",
    "Take intro psych or Intro to cognitive science before this class. The professors are much more engaging.",
    "A great insight into human emotions. I would recommend this class - everything we learned in it was very relevant to our daily lives.",
    "I would if the student needs a SO requirement with not a lot of work.",
    "Psych 131 is an extremely comprehensive view of emotion and it is extremely relevant information so it is an easy class to focus for.",
    "Human Emotion approaches emotion from different angles throughout the semester, from defining it to examining it in animals to exploring what happens when it doesn't work the way it should. The class is very cohesive. There are critical responses assigned for each lecture, and textbook and journal readings as well. It's an interesting psychology course with novel topics.",
    "Super easy and interesting. Good 5th class.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, I would recommend it. It was a very specific course that didn't tie any other topics to it.",
    "I highly recommend.It helps you get a great introduction to the causes, applications, and effects of emotions. A great way to begin studying psychology and a light workload so it won't scare you away. A lot of memorization for the tests, but if you start studying a week ahead you will be more than prepared for the tests.",
    "A very interesting course; great to take whether or not you have taken any other psychology. Low workload and reasonable amounts of stress. Yes; as said, it's quite interesting, and does not take an inordinate amount of time.",
    "It is a great intro to psych class, the topics are broad but all related to emotions, so some times it will be more interesting than others. But the workload is fine and the teachers are very nice.",
    "Take it if you're interested in a broad overview of human emotion, but know that you won't get a lot of depth on any topic. Steady workload throughout the semester.",
    "A great 5th class.Midterms are fair (review guides are available before each exam)The project was fun to work on.Readings can get boring, but the study guides will tell you which one you need to focus on.Plenty of guest lecturers so you are always in for a treat.",
    "I think it is a relatively interesting class that I recommend if you are looking for a less challenging social science",
    "Yes! Interesting lectures, and not too much work!",
    "Summary: the why and how behind emotions, as far as science understands it.Suggestion: take it, you'll learn a lot about yourself and the people you interact with daily. Things you've always believed will acquire some teeth. But be aware that this is a field of research in its infant stages, so things are still sort of up in the air.",
    "Good class. Take it! It's not a lot of work and it's very interesting!",
    "Psychology 131 is basically a class on many different aspects of human emotions. It's more specific than Intro to Psychology, but still is broad enough to touch on many areas in the field. I would recommend it because I think it's a really great class to take if you're interested in Psychology, whether you're considering it as a major or you just think it's a fascinating field.",
    "Good class, fun and simple",
    "I would definitely recommend this as an easy 5th class or as an interesting but easy social psych class. 3 exams (which are all very straightforward and are taken directly from lecture slides) and one short\/easy project. Take this class!!",
    "I recommend!!",
    "You learn a lot. Lots of work though.",
    "If you need a gut psychology class which mostly consists of material taught in AP Psychology and has some interesting emotion-related topics, then by all means take it.As a theatre director, I did find a few topics taught in class actually useful for my work in theatre.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the psychology major. The course is interesting. However, if you are looking to take one psychology course at Yale, intro to psychology is the class to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in how emotions shape people's lives. The material kept me engaged,and the lectures were concise and to the point. Be warned, though, that there is a fair bit amount of work that comes with the class.",
    "These guys are looking for the letter of the law in terms of assignments--if you hand in a reading response that's a half a page single spaced instead of a full page double spaced, you will have points deducted for failing to meet the length requirement.",
    "I would 100% recommend the course. Interesting material and lectures, well- structured, and the work was completely manageable. A great course overall!",
    "A really easy psych course if you are at all interested. Virtually no work is required and everyone does well.",
    "This class will never be taught again at Yale. However, I loved this course. Human Emotions just sounds like a super-interesting class and it lived up to its name. We learned everything about emotions--why people cry, how people can cope with stress, anxiety disorders, and emotions and cultures. It was the class I got most excited about, and I definitely didn't mind waking up early for this 9 am class b\/c it was such a fun, relaxed, and interesting class. Professor Gruber and Devlin would also play music for us in the mornings before class. It was one of the only classes I enjoyed out of my schedule this semester and I will truly miss having Professor Gruber\/Devlin and this class!",
    "Of course! The class was super exciting every morning! Must take this class before graduating.",
    "A good introduction class for those interested in psychology. It may not be very thorough or in-depth on some topics, but it covers a variety of different areas of study and exposes you to several interesting and relevant research studies.",
    "Psych131 is your typical psych class, similar in structure to intro psych. Tests covr r material from the PowerPoint slides in lecture. Not much work, only weekly questions which are very quick, and one project\/essay which is so structured that most of the work is done for you. However, the material is much drier than I expected, which made it hard to pay attention\/make myself study at times.",
    "You look at many different facets of emotion, but a lot of the material will overlap with general psych courses, AP Psych, etc. There's also a fair amount of busywork. Take the course if you're very interested in current emotion research and perhaps pursuing psychology research.",
    "Great intro course that is very doable and interesting.",
    "Pretty simple course with life-applicable information. I'd take it for grade if I had the opportunity to again.",
    "Take it. it's easy and interesting.",
    "Really cool, a little more specialized than intro psych, provides you with valuable insight into the role emotions play in everyday life.",
    "I would recommend this class. Some of the topics we covered seemed a little redundant, and there is a two paragraph reading\/lecture response twice a week. Prof. Gruber is very nice, but sometimes a boring lecturer because she sounds very rehearsed when she speaks. There are three exams and a final project. So if you enjoy psych classes, this is an okay option. It wasn't my favorite but it wasn't the worst either.",
    "Very interesting class, but definitely a lot more challenging than expected.",
    "Human Emotion was an interesting class with a very manageable workload and three very fair tests. There was one short paper\/project, but it allowed you to look at anything related to emotion that interested you, which made it enjoyable to write. The material in the course was interesting but the first few weeks were definitely more engaging and substantial.",
    "Human Emotion is a really cool course, and I probably would've done a better job paying attention if not for the fact that it was offered at 9 am. Sometimes the lectures seem a little bit simplistic, but the exams can be difficult and require you to remember things from the powerpoint verbatim (which can be super annoying.) The ATF and Professor can sometimes go a little too fast when going through the powerpoints, so you might have to look at them yourself later. I would recommend this class if you're interested in psychology, even if you're a non-major (like I am), it's pretty accessible!",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "It is a comprehensive look and introduction to the field of psychological human emotion, I would recommend it to another student if they had any interest in psychology and wanted to learn about all of this important information.",
    "I would not recommend this course. There are much better psych lectures out there!",
    "It's an interesting course in that it covers the basics, but it doesn't delve too deep into detail. As a result, because we couldn't get too deep, sometimes things felt a little repetitive. Also, the reading\/lecture responses twice every week just felt like busy work after awhile.",
    "I would undoubtedly recommend it. It was the study of human emotions and how they are not something to be disregarded as irrational but rather a valuable tool for understanding EVERYTHING.",
    "I do not recommend this course at all. There were a few interesting ideas, but for the most part it was a dry, tedious gut. Remember: the course is not nearly as interesting, deep, or valuable as the namemakes it sound.",
    "Take it for the interesting subject matter.",
    "Easy but pretty boring.",
    "Human emotion is a pretty interesting class overall. You will learn a lot about the nature of emotions and how complicated they are. Classes are fairly engaging, but having it at 9:00 was a huge drag. In addition, the tests are really annoying and nitpicky, and the readings can be incredibly dense. That said, there is a lot of cool stuff to be learned here, and if you haven't taken many psych classes or are interested in the topic, I would recommend at least shopping this one.",
    "Relatively interesting. You don't really need to buy the book. I never opened it. Some of the readings get a little dense, but you don't need to do all of them to do well. The midterms were a little more detailed than I expected, but overall fair. Don't expect to do well on the midterms without studying. The workload is light, but for the exams, you get what you invest.",
    "PLEASE DO YOURSELF THE FAVOR AND TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "Would not recommend. Unnecessarily very stressful course.",
    "This class was probably my least favorite class I've taken at Yale. With annoying bi weekly assignments to unfair subjective grading to a teacher that barely taught; this class was straight up bad. On the final I received points off on multiple occasions for saying, \"emotions can reach a very high level\" instead of \"extreme level.\" I'm sorry we are college students and not fifth graders that simply memorize slides and points off for something like that is heinous. Do. Not. Take. This. Class.",
    "I would definitely NOT recommend this class to a fellowstudent. There are much better classes to take in the Psyc department.",
    "Easy, useful, 9AM sucks.",
    "Yes. It's not bad, but it was also not my favorite.",
    "Lectures are pretty interesting and since all the notes you need are on the lecture slides it's easy to stay engaged. Most of the readings are summarized in the next lecture.",
    "Do not take this class. It is cool material, presented in a way that makes you feel like you are back in 7th grade health class. The titles of the lectures all sound awesome, and then, inevitably, a bunch of bullshitty terms are used to water down the material (all of which you have to memorize) and all the cool stuff becomes really uncool.",
    "As a psych major, this was actually my favorite psych class I've taken so far. I didn't find that I was bored by overlap in other classes or anything, which I have found to be a problem in the past. Defintiely take it-workload is managable (and the one real \"assignment\" you have is actually borderline fun) and the tests don't try to trick you. Great for psych majors and non-psych majors alike.",
    "Great course!",
    "Okay class, definitely glad I took it Cr\/D. Those who didn't struggled to make above a B.",
    "This is an interesting and extremely straightforward class. Lectures are decent, especially if you're interested in emotion. The exams are very simple if you memorize exactly what's on the study guide. The final project is extremely easy. Overall, this class is very simple and doesn't require much effort.",
    "Interesting in the beginning. Becomes repetitive in the end.",
    "Great course",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Such a great class, very interesting material. There are critical questions (do 15 out of 19 throughout the semester), 3 tests (non-cumulative), an outreach project, and no final. Take this class if it is offered.",
    "Definitely take. Really interesting, not too difficult, but very applicable.",
    "Each lecture is an overview of emotion and *fill in the blank random psych related topic*. The material is interesting and professor gruber definitely knows her stuff. There are two things that keep this classy from being anything more than okay. 1) it's at 9 am. 2) it is the least Yale-like class I have ever taken at Yale. On the meeting problem. You're probably thinking: nameless reviewer, you're just a lazy sad sack who can get himself up in the morning. And maybe you're right. But when the class you have to wake up for at 9 am is a lecture, and the lectures are just okay, and there's totally someone in the class you can get notes from because you have a few friends in there (it's big enough that you will), it's really difficult to get your hungover ass out of bed. In terms of Yale-ness. The only way you can do the required responses for the class is by attending lecture because they post the questions at the end of lecture. The questions are not available anywhere else and they a really shitty about making sure you don't take pictures to send to all your friends. They ask for your ID when you turn in your exams because they want to confirm that it's you, and the class website and email address makes the whole experience strangely impersonal. Overall, interesting easy class but take it with a grain of salt.",
    "This is a fascinating course that anyone should take just to learn more about human emotions.",
    "I would recommend it. It's fairly easy class with interesting material. The readings could be dry but classes were fun",
    "The entire experience is great, and it's all manageable. Don't be careless or forget to study. Incredibly interesting material, even though it seems like it's all stuff you should already know (but don't).",
    "I would say that they should definitely take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to other students who want a basic knowledge of the effect of human emotion. It is an interesting and well-taught class. However be prepared for the exams, as there is a lot of memorization.",
    "The material is somewhat interesting but less so because it's pretty intuitive. Most of the information should come naturally unless you've never interacted with another human being. It's also a 9:00AM class which makes it less fun.",
    "A very basic psych intro class. Accessible for non-majors. Lectures are not particularly dry.",
    "Okay class. Not much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even if you are not a psychology major. Really easy because the information is interesting.",
    "I would recommend the course, itwasn't too difficult although there is homework (reading and a response) twice a week. I didn't mind it but some other people might. Another thing I liked was that we had three non-cumulative exams (no official final) and were provided a list of topics to study for each exam.",
    "take this class if you have no idea what an emotion is and need to learn the basics. don't take this class if you are starting out in psych, i recommend taking intro psych with chun if you want a more holistic and rewarding experience",
    "I would not recommend this class under any circumstances. The workload is not exactly minimal (given the utterly useless \"critical response questions,\" due at every class), and the professors \/ TFs seemed quite unengaged.",
    "Fantastic class. You learn so much in this intro class. Plus, the information is not only interesting but helpful in understanding interactions in life.",
    "Be careful to all the rubrics\/materials on the website to a tee. Instructors are extremely strict on these kinds of things. Otherwise, ok class.",
    "Some very interesting material and fun lectures (including some great guest lectures). Light workload: 3 non-cumulative exams and a paper\/creative project. A good elective or fifth credit. The 9am time is awful, but definitely try to go to lecture (though it's not really that necessary to do well on exams). I'm not sure how much I got out of it having taken a couple intro psych classes before, but it's a fun and easy course.",
    "I'd take it if you're looking for an interesting 5th credit (or an easier 4th). There isn't much work - two reading responses due every week instead of section and 3 exams as well as a project. The readings are supplemented well with the course material but are not very long so very manageable. Lectures are not super exciting but are definitely interesting to learn about how human emotions affect social interactions, etc. Professors are both very knowledgeable as well.",
    "Yes! The class covers a broad range of topics related to human emotion, and the variety helps keep it interesting throughout the semester. The workload isn't too bad \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just three non-cumulative exams, the community outreach project, and a response due each class (you'll get full credit for just doing them). Not just a class for psych majors! A lot of the information you learn is applicable to daily life.",
    "Human Emotion is a great introduction to current research in psychology related to the study of emotion. The course incorporates interviews with various experts in emotion. Workload is extremely manageable with weekly reading and reading responses, 3 non-cumulative exams, and an outreach project.",
    "Human Emotion was an easy class, with some interesting material. Tests are about memorization, and the required project can be done pretty easily. Not that it really affected the quality of the course, but it just seemed like Professor Gruber didn't want to lecture. Between having TAs teach a third of the classes to taking up 10 minutes of lecture with YouTube interviews I didn't really pay attention to, it just seemed like Professor Gruber was phoning it in. Well-designed PowerPoints, though.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. I thought it would be one of my favorites this semester and the teaching fellows and professors made it very unenjoyable and stressful.",
    "Yes, because it is fairly easy, and has a lot of useful information. I would especially recommend taking it if you are a psych major.",
    "Yes I would recommend Human Emotions to another student because I really enjoyed the class. Human Emotions gave a great and detailed description of why we feel certain things and what is physically going on when we feel certain emotions.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student- it is interesting and relevant, even if you have not taken any psychology courses in the past. The teachers\/material is very accessible and because of the way it is organized you know exactly what is expected of you to do well. If you do not like many assignments, then this is not the class for you... but if you like more assignments that are worth less of your grade so it is easier to know where you stand in the course, this is a great one to take. Professor Gruber and Hillary Devlin really care about their students and want them to do well!",
    "I do not recommend this class. The interesting material is covered early in the course and then it gets boring and dry for the rest of the semester. The class is taught by a professor and a TA, and there are a few guest lectures. More often than not, the TA would give the lecture. It's a pretty easy class. If you go to lecture, many of the multiple choice on the midterms are obvious. There are 3 midterms (no final), a paper\/project, and reading responses.If you really want to learn about human emotions, I recommend you take this class online during the summer. Don't waste your time at Yale on this average class. It's a waste.",
    "I would. It was an interesting topic that not many people think to study and it covered so much more than just what emotions are like how they affect the body and how one can control them.",
    "Ok course. Her tests emphasize regurgitating small details from lecture. If you memorize small details from the lecture, you'll do well. Her tests don't emphasize concepts, or psych concepts in general.",
    "Not a lot of work, the readings aren't necessary, only the few concepts required for the test from the reading. The outreach project is graded somewhat harshly compared to other aspects of the course.",
    "All in all, this was a really cool class and I'm glad I took it. As my first psychology class at Yale, I don't have much to compare it too but it was an interesting and engaging class nonetheless. It's really not worth your time if you're not willing to go to lecture though; the text and material alone won't do the course must justice. Lectures, while sometimes dull, were more often than not very engaging, often funny and kept my attention. As long as you go to lecture, the tests and homework assignments really aren't that difficult either.",
    "Don't take it. Reading responses were really annoying",
    "PSYC 131 is a class about human emotion. Three non-cumulative exams (multiple choice and short answer) and an outreach project. Highly recommended!",
    "offer new perspective on human emotion",
    "Again, if this is your first psychology class at Yale (or if you've just taken Intro Psych), then I think you would be well-served by this class. If, like me, you were hoping to expand your already-existing understanding of psychology to include more knowledge about affective states, I think you will be sorely disappointed by this class.",
    "Human Emotion is an absolutely fascinating course. Every lecture is engaging and fun, and you'll learn so much about human (and other animal) feeling, and even get more in touch with your own personality and emotions. There is quite a bit of reading involved, and questions you need to respond to before each class, but overall the workload is manageable. This class covered a wide variety of topics, including morality and emotion, happiness, stress, neuroscience, and much more. Professor Gruber and the TA's are amazing; I STRONGLY recommend this course!",
    "Yes i would not too much work yet very relevant",
    "Good intro level psych class with some interesting real life applications. Lectures can be kind of dry, but the professors and Tfs are really nice. Not too muchwork but gets kind of repetitive. Outreach project is as fun as you make it.",
    "Yes, it's a really fun class and you also take away concepts that are relevant to your daily life because everybody deals with emotion whether they suppress it or express it, not to mention how it affects social interactions.",
    "Psych 131 is a very organized course. Everything from the PowerPoints to the lectures to the study sheets is very organized. One weakness of the class is that it seems to depend on a lot of rote memorization instead of understanding. So I would suggest you study every study sheet very closely and make sure you have memorized all of the material as best you can. I would also recommend taking advantage of the extra credit, and of the TA's whenever you need help.Overall, I think this was a good course but it did not live up to my expectations. I thought some of the material was dull and I don't know if a whole class is needed to cover the topic of human emotion. I would not recommend this class to someone looking to be very engaged in a class. I think there are many other courses at Yale that can serve that purpose. However, I would recommend this course if you need to fulfill a requirement or need a straight-forward 4th or 5th class. I think I'd ultimately describe the course as mediocre in terms of how it grabbed my attention but very well-organized and very straight-forward.",
    "This class was really chill. I'd recommend. The exams were really predictable. The material was very interesting. hillary was really helpful and super nice.",
    "This was a very elementary course that gave the basic foundation of the study of emotions. I would not recommend it because the potentially thought-provoking information was presented in a dumbed-down manner that encouraged mindless memorization.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "I'd recommend the course if you're looking for something interesting, don't mind a large lecture, and don't mind memorizing lots of information for tests.",
    "This class will be rewarding for anyone with a passing interest in psychology or the emotional dynamics of social interaction. You'll definitely find yourself observing the phenomena discussed in lecture in your everyday life, and you'll also learn about recent research concerning emotion in mental health, developmental health, and gender studies.The class has a large writing component - there are two one-page reading responses due every week, and they're honestly a bigger hassle than you might anticipate. The grading rubic is very strict since there's such a large class size, and a lot of the evaluation just depends on how well you can memorize slides. For the exams, you should memorize everything verbatim - if you deviate by a few words in your answers on the tests, you'll get points off.If you have Professor Gruber, that's great - she's awesome and plays music before class every day, which is a big pick-me-up for the 9:00am lecture. Basically, this class won't change your life but it might make you look at it differently.",
    "It was an ok course... it was at 9am this semester, and for me was not quite exciting enough for the early start time. I went to every class, but I spent more time being bored\/tired than engaged. The information is interesting, although the claims aren't always well-justified, and I didn't really enjoy having the Professor and ATF ask questions to the 200 person lecture -- it was just inherently awkward. However, the class wasn't too hard (memorization rather than concepts) and I did much better on tests when I didn't do the reading and just focused on the lectures.",
    "Yes I recommend! Very useful information that can be applied to every day life. Learned a lot in the class, enjoyed the variety of information taught.",
    "This class taught me so much about people. Learning about the way emotions work was incredibly enlightening to me personally as it taught me how to better function as a person, how to be happier, and how to be a better friend. It feels silly to say that this class changed me, but it's true. As an academic class it had an incredibly simple format. There are lecture slides which hold much of the information we are required to know for exams. The slides are posted online after, but you still need to attend class because the \"critical questions\" that are part of the nightly assignments are only asked in lecture. I could probably have had a better experience if it weren't a 9am class and if I had known how much detail there was in the first exam, but these are minor detriments compared to the benefits I got from this class.",
    "Take it, it's a nice intro to the study of emotions and the workload is minimal. Going to every class to get the daily questions (only provided in the powerpoints in lecture) is annoying, but you're given 4 skips so it's easy to keep up with.",
    "It is a summation of the emotions that humans universally encounter, describing what they are and why they occur.",
    "A pretty mediocre lecture. You'll learn some interesting things, but it's not worth it to wade through all the illegitimate busy work that comes with it. I regret taking this class, and I would not recommend it. Save yourself the trouble and take into psych instead.",
    "This course, while interesting, reviewed many of the concepts from social psychology. However, there were many amazing guest lecturers and we watched a series of interviews with experts in the field to learn about what people actually do with degrees in psychology, which I found to be very helpful.",
    "Take it as a good intro course if you need it, or just want an interesting class, but the course load is immense for such a survey course (2 reading responses a week, three midterms and a paper in addition to a harsh grading scheme)."
