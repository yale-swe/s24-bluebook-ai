   "comments": [
    "I learned much about experimental design, RCTs, regression, external validity, and other concepts relevant to political science research. This course effectively communicated how political questions can be answered with quantitative\/experimental approaches. I learned how to turn \"questions\" I found too big to answer into questions I could answer through empirical methods. The nominal focus on foreign aid was helpful to understand the landscape of this (declining?) field.",
    "This course gave me a lot actually. It helped me gain a more critical eye into scientific articles in general and made me realize that they can all be evaluated for strengths and weaknesses rather than revered as academic works. It also helped me understand the importance of various statistical techniques like randomization and think through some of the ways to optimally set up a research study. This class opened my eyes to the fact that various firms utilize different methodologies, many of which can undermine their whole work. Most significantly, this course helped me understand that those conducting these studies are just people, and that people are never really experts and can be flawed no matter how many degrees or accolades they have.",
    "Learnt how to engage critically with literature and be a lot more skeptical about the things that are presented to me than I was before - definitely a much needed skill in political science. Learnt how to write an in depth research proposal, and in doing so learnt a lot about a new subject matter.",
    "I developed an excellent understanding of how to pose research questions and conduct empirical research, in addition to diving further into the field of international development and foreign aid."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: personalization of final projects! Prof. Aronow worked with every student to craft a meaningful and challenging final product. Several students are turning their projects into actual empirical research, which is remarkable. The syllabus and reading responses provide students an opportunity to question the experimental design of empirical research and understand how papers could be improved. Weakness: the only weakness (which is also the course's strength) was the fluid syllabus. The fact that we moved around readings was a bit disorienting at first, but overall it allowed us to focus on material more pertinent to our research.",
    "This course is strong because it allows for a tremendous amount of flexibility in what is studied. The professor is open to focusing on what is of interest and what is in most need of review. We even chose which textbook we would like to use! This course is also strong in that the professor does a great job of making students feel comfortable and welcome. He makes sure that not student feels dumb or too uninformed. The only real weakness would be focus\/organization-- which is probably expected. It would have been helpful for me to have a bit more structure in our discussions (maybe having agenda items) or to summarize key takeaways\/points to remember from our conversations.",
    "Very interesting class discussions and I really enjoyed working on my final research project. Also, due to the small class size I got to know my fellow students and Prof Aronow very well.",
    "A great course if you're an EPE\/Poli Sci major and thinking about thesis topics. While the substance is foreign aid, the focus of the class is on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of empirical research in foreign aid."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Take this course if you are interested in conducting empirical research in political science. Professor Aronow is one of a kind, and he is very devoted to student projects. The small class size allowed for personalization and facilitated discussion. You need to be self-motivated in this class, because if you don't work with Professor Aronow, your final product will not be feasible or interesting. NOTE: the course is only nominally about foreign aid. While the papers are generally about international dev. issues, your analysis will focus on research design. You have an opportunity to focus on various political science questions depending on your interest. No real prerequisites although if you do good work in this class you'll probably end up taking STAT 230 or metrics I to learn a stats language.",
    "I would recommend this course depending on what you are looking for! This course is great for somebody who is looking to develop a sound research proposal (perhaps for a thesis?) or for somebody who wants to learn more about common mistakes that researchers make. It is definitely better to have some statistical knowledge before taking this. Don't let that intimidate you though-- even just one or two introductory courses can be enough to catch yourself up to speed! The professor is wonderful.",
    "Yes, if you want to critically engage with academic articles and their potential flaws\/weaknesses and think about a project of your own in the same light.",
    "Yes if you're looking for a research design seminar that is international development focused. While it is low on workload, the course is not very structured (we were a 5 person class) so you need to be self driven in order to get what you want out of it. If you delve into the learning material though it could be a very valuable class."
