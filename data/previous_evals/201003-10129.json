   "comments": [
    "The course starts by teaching you how start up your own company (processes for incorporation), then moves to funding your company (venture capital and stocks), then moves to issues of corporate governance.We touch briefly on each topic and did a tiny bit of what she said that first-year associates in biglaw firms do. I would recommend this to students who want to go into venture capitalism, start up their own company, or be a corporate lawyer.",
    "Yes, but figure out if you're actually interested in the topic because it is really specific.",
    "This was a great seminar! It is one of the few non-science \/ engineering courses offered at Yale where you actually learn something practical. I came into this class with zero understanding about the legal side of running a business. After only a month I was comfortable talking to lawyers about the startup I was working on.Professor Lim was friendly and approachable and made the topics very interesting and easy to follow. She also brought in some good guest speakers.My only qualm with the course is that the focus on startups really disappeared towards the last third of the semester.Overall though I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in running a company.",
    "This course was an introduction to corporate law and the legal issues involved in starting a company. It was also an introduction to some of the major case law involved in these subjects. The course did not involve too much work and was very informative, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "One of the most practical courses I've taken at Yale. If you're interested in corporate law or entrepreneurship, take this class."
