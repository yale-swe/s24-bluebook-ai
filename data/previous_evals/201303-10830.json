    "This is a great class, and a great continuation of the Japanese language track. The 3 day a week structure makes this much less work-intensive than the previous years, and so that is a big improvement from the earlier levels.However, since it is not every day, I felt my speaking skills did not improve as much as I wished they had. That being said, my writing, reading, and listening all greatly improved, since the class focuses on watching drama and anime, reading poems and short stories, and learning lots of kanji.Definitely take this class!",
    "It is definitely a good class to keep up your language skills, so take it or else you will certainly forget most of your Japanese very quickly. However, don't expect that you will get immensely better by the end of the semester. It seems much more like a maintenance class. You need to actually go to Japan to get a lot better.",
    "Yes! Of course!",
    "A great course! Although students who have started Japanese from L1 at Yale may feel a difference in style of instruction (not so much drill-based as the first- and second-year classes, plus much of the grammar has already been covered, so the emphasis of this class is on understanding texts and readings, and their associated vocabulary and more nuanced grammar points), the class is as always very enjoyable and covers a lot of Japanese. Highly recommended."
