    "Definitely recommended. What you won't get is a close analysis of your prose, if that's what you're after. There's not much discussion of language. But there's a lot of good stuff on your voice, tone, plotting, ideas, mechanics of plot, how to work with stereotypes, and that sort of thing. So it lends itself well to novel-length work; not as much to small art stories.",
    "Take it, if you can get in. John Crowley is so knowledgeable and he's really able to pinpoint what you're going for to improve your writing. There will be a huge variety of styles in the class and you can experiment with basically anything you want.",
    "This is a great intro course for science fiction and fantasy, but take another course if you want to learn the basics or read more examples of these genres."
