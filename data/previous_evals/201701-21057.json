    "Very interdisciplinary approach to understanding Jewish thought.",

    "A truly great and informative class on the leading Jewish thinkers of all time",
    "I learned so much about modern Jewish philosophy and history. This class was incredible.",
    "I learned about modern Jewish thought through the lens of different ideologies, movements, and thinkers. The course provided a holistic definition of what it means to be a Jew today."

    "The strength of the course is Professor Stern is a strong lecturer who can keep you engaged with the material regardless of what it is.",
    "I really liked the class and felt it was really good as is.",
    "Professor Stern's lectures were amazing. He made the course material engaging and always had truly valuable insights. The readings he assigned, on the other hand, were a little lengthy and rarely that necessary to get through class time, which made them a bit imposing even when Professor Stern told us not to do them in their entirety. If he pared the readings down to their essences and assigned that, I would have gotten much more out of them."

    "Only if like the study of religions.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class. Even if you have little or no background in Jewish Thought there's no problem as Professor Stern explains everything very clearly and doesn't assume you have any background knowledge. The assignments are all very reasonable in difficulty and grading with prompt feedback from the Professor. Great course.",
    "YES, a truly great class",
    "This class was exceptional. I highly recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in taking it.",
    "Yes! Professor Stern is really engaging and passionate about the subject and takes material that could easily be really difficult and presents it clearly and cleanly in a digestible way. The class is definitely worth your while even if this is not your subject area.",
    "This course was a really great experience for me as a mostly cultural, not that religious Jew. I probably woulld have gotten less out of it if I weren't Jewish, and I probably would've gotten more out of it if I were more religious. Professor Stern is an amazing lecturer and a very cool person--he completely makes the course. Unless you attempt to do every single reading, the workload is very manageable. He grades the midterm more harshly than he does the final, but overall the class is pretty low stress. It's hard to retain a lot of the specifics, but Professoe Stern does an exceptional job of giving you the big picture and making you feel connected to it."
