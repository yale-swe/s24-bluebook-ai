    "1. Readings tended to be somewhat complicated, but then Professor Mendelsohn would break them down and explain the concepts behind them in class. 9. Professor Mendelsohn is very excited to talk with students after\/outside of class; definitely go talk to him if you want further explanations, guidance, or to talk through your projects.",
    "Excellent class covering a range of topics and presents a valuable and powerful way of developing solutions to environmental management problems.",
    "This course was an interesting introductions to IAMs. I now know a lot more about an area of research that I knew nothing about before the beginning of the year, and I think that I have some idea of how the models are made. I would have liked to get a bit more into the technical details of the model. The course served as an interesting introduction to IAMs, but I feel like it would have been more interesting to at least discuss the decisions that the modelers made in constructing their models. It might have been helpful to build up to the final project a bit, too, maybe by writing a smaller model first or doing a few problem sets about the models we covered. It also might have been helpful if students were given guiding questions throughout the lectures, to make sure they are involved and following along. It seems like this field of study is still taking shape, and it would be interesting to hear a bit more about what other students are thinking about the models.",
    "The professor was very supportive of student learning and was extremely knowledgeable. I thought the pace was a little slow and could have maybe incorporated more than one paper per lesson to enhance learning and discussion and use the full amount of class time. I think that would increase the structure of the class."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided an opportunity for students to develop their own projects, and to dive deeply into subjects of personal interest. I learned a lot from this process, both about the subject I was researching and about the methods of integrated assessment. The readings provided a very well-structured survey of the discipline and served as a great introduction to all of the material out there. Prof. Mendelsohn's lectures were very engaging; he is able to illuminate topics that can be very complex and opaque.",
    "Professor Mendelsohn's explanations of how scientific and economic models need to and do fit together. Also the modeling project, which pushed us to see what it's like to actually use integrated models.",
    "Structure of class was great (framing each class as trying to answer a specific question), interesting environmental issues.",
    "The student designed model was a nice part of the learning process. It allowed us to apply the learning in a real life situation.",
    "The final project was a really great opportunity to apply what we learned throughout the semester - it was exciting to produce my own original integrated assessment, which could have actual policy implications. I also appreciated the opportunity to write about my project in the final report. It really helped me to think through each of my steps and make sure they were logically sound.",
    "I learned a lot about the economic aspects of climate adaptation and really benefitted from doing a project of my choice related to that topic."

   "comments": [
    "Clarity in assignment expectations.",
    "For some of the older papers, talk about how the approach to those issue has changed today.",
    "It would have been useful to have started the class with an intro to IAMs (that is, in a broader sense, what are they?) rather than diving straight into examples. We read a critique at the suggestion of a classmate, but it would have been helpful to have had more of a formal theoretical introduction. I also would have benefitted from a more frequent series of assignments throughout the course, or some form of more structured discussion. The midterm was helpful, and the final was great, but I sometimes felt lost when learning about the other IAM examples that were presented in class. Lastly, I understand that this course was initially supposed to be co-taught by both Prof Mendelsohn and a professor with more of a science background. I think that could be really interesting, and should be prioritized in future renditions of the course.",
    "It would be great if there were more papers discussed each class (maybe 2 instead of 1). It would also be nice to spend a class giving a background overview on integrated assessments and the general structure, before exploring different examples."

    "Yes, very insightful class.",
    "Partially. The science part exceed my expectations, but the managerial not as much.",
    "Overall, yes. Though I come from a more science-focused background and was sometimes confused by the economics behind some of the models, I generally feel much more confident in my ability to understand and apply economic thinking in an environmental decision-making context.",
    "The course met my expectations. I was interested to learn more about climate adaptation from an economics perspective, and the topics discussed and project helped do that."

    "Get started early on the independent project. It will give you more time to fully-form your ideas, find relevant data, and generally enjoy the work!",
    "This is a good course for those interested in integrated assessment models and how models can inform decision making. You get out of this class what you put in, so if you're engaged and interested in learning how to interpret, dissect, and create models, it can help you move into that world; if you're not that into integrated assessment models, you could go through it without learning much and shouldn't take it. This class skews toward the academic over the practical, which is another thing for students to keep in mind. The outcomes of the models have practical implications, but what you get out of the class by the end of the semester is more focused on how models work than on practical knowledge you will turn around and use in your next job.",
    "Take it, it is great. Good practice is doing an analysis of a paper and developing an integrative assessment as your final project.",
    "This is a science class. If your interest is only in management, re-think your choice.",
    "For the midterm, choose to present a paper that relates to your final project topic. This really enabled me to think deeply about\/thoroughly understand a particular IAM, which was a more fluid learning experience.",
    "Choose an interesting topic, and work closely with Professor Mendelsohn on it. He is more than willing to spend time with you working on the model, but you have to reach out to him (and go to office hours).",
