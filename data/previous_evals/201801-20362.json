    "The historical timeline of the development of urbanism and urban design, and the influences and insights that has inspired modern cities.",
    "spatial theory and urban design knowledge, adobe indesign",
    "Learnt a lot about the history of urban design. Read most of the major thinkers in the field, great overview though can be a little theoretical at times",
    "In this class I learned about the history of urban design through the presentation of different projects and movements. The readings also exposed me to theories of public space and urban design.",
    "Learnt a lot about the history of urban design and the different modes of thought that have dominated the field. The design assignments for undergrads were a lot of fun to do (though the paper at the end was kind of meh)",
    "Really incredible introduction to the history of urbanism and urban design initiatives.",
    "This course taught me about cities around the world and how they have developed. The readings dove into different ideologies and different issues cities deal with, and how they choose to deal with them. The assignments asked us to look at specific cases of what we had been learning about in a more broad way.",
    "I learned about the history of cities and urban design.",
    "great introductory architecture course, learned about general trends in urban planning and design throughout modern history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The topics covered are deeply fascinating. Nonetheless, while the school of thought of urbanism clearly originated in Europe, a more diverse and less Euro-\/America-centric discussion of urban design would have been much appreciated, a thought I saw shared by peers. Although late in the lectures the discussions diversified a little, it felt too late to give it enough study. I was very curious about how the western world's conception and development of urbanism compares with the rest of the world.",
    "more hands on assignments that allowed students to apply skills and theory -- perhaps a seminar\/workshop style configuration rather than a lecture course",
    "I loved that the course didn't have an exam-- it was one of the few classes where I could learn about content (and certainly be accountable for it in section) but never needed to feel stressed about how much I remembered. A real treat! I also did actually appreciate the length of the class-- I felt like I was able to relax when I sat in lecture. Section is definitely necessary. The readings were also my favorite from the three architecture classes that I took this year!",
    "Strengths: The range of readings is great, I like that we cover most of the major Western urban designers and their writings Weaknesses: Though our lectures touched upon non-Western cities, the readings were very much America\/Euro-centric which I found a little disappointing given the long history of a distinct form of urban design in the Eastern hemisphere and new developments too. The first three weeks were spent talking purely about Greece and Rome while I hope we could have touched upon Ancient Chinese, Japanese, Middle Eastern etc etc cities as well.",
    "The Lectures could have been a bit more organized o make it easier to pay attention for the full time period.",
    "Strengths: Great overview for a beginner in the field. This was also my first architecture class and really takes a broad perspective on the field instead of going into the nitty gritties. Weaknesses: 1. I wish we had spent more time talking about non-American\/European cities. The readings are very much made for and focussed on the West. While lectures sometimes touched upon other cultures in urban planning, the readings never did. During the first three weeks, while talking abou ancient cities, we just focussed on Rome and Greece without talking about China, Japan, India and their ancient cities at all! 2. Too many readings that are not given adequate attention. I had a great TA who was able to bridge the gaps between lectures and readings but we still didn't touch upon 50-66% of readings on a regular basis.",
    "More international examples from developing cities!",
    "The lecture was amazingly insightful and Professor Plattus made great use of examples to substantiate all of his ideas. The only weakness I would say is that the course could better integrate the readings from section which are really fantastic back into the lecture so that all the connections are clear.",
    "The strength of this course were the readings that we did. I felt like they enriched the lectures and led to interesting conversations in section. The weakness was that it was difficult to understand what we were supposed to take away from the lectures. Also grading was very vague.",
    "The lectures were interesting and there was a nice progression through the material. The readings were too long and didn't seem to provide that much to the course. The assignments weren't great but also not too hard.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures, and the discussions we had in section to tie the reading material, course material, and contemporary questions of urban design all together."

   "comments": [
    "A really cool course about urban design and how the school of thought came to be. If you like me like cities and enjoy realizing how such complex structures come to be, definitely check out the class!",
    "yes, good overview of urban design. warning it is primarily from the us-european canon and examples. would be great for this course to expand more to examples and urban design strategies from other parts of the world in the future",
    "Yes! For those interested in urban design, absolutely!",
    "Yes, if you are interested in urban design definitely take this. You will get as much out of it as you put into it. if you want to do all the readings and work hard on the projects, it will be a very rewarding class that makes you think differently about urban spaces, and how we interact with cities.",
    "Yes! This is a great intro urban design course and I think you will gain from it no matter what your major. I come from a background in economics and really enjoyed learning about the development aspects of urban planning.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course because the lecture is really great and engaging, and the sections were nice in their more organic covering of the readings.",
    "I would recommend this course because of all the exposure it gives to what's happening in cities around the world, and how cities grow and develop. I think that this course is very friendly for people who haven't studied urbanism before and lends itself well to bringing in many different perspectives.",
    "This is an interesting and relatively easy course. Go to the lectures (especially lecture 3, which was my favorite) because they are absolutely the best part of this course. The readings can mostly be skimmed because none of the assignments rely on information from them. The assignments have the potential to be interesting if you make them so. (there were two projects and one 10 page research paper).",
    "yes; the course is a very thorough overview for those interested in architecture\/urban design"
