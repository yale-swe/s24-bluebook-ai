   "comments": [
    "Yes, this class will help native speakers improve reading and writing tremendously.",
    "I would recommend it if you are prepared to dedicate the time to chinese. As someone who doesn't have the best work ethic, I found it a challenge at times but it's definitely manageable if you stay on top of things.",
    "Yes, take advantage of Yale's great Chinese program. Chinese is a language that will become very handy in the future.",
    "Yes, only if they are sincerely interested in learning Chinese.",
    "Chinese 112 is a good course, and it's especially nice that it's tailored for heritage speakers. If you've grown up listening to Chinese and speaking a little, it's a great class to truly hone your Chinese and improve it for real-world purposes.",
    "CHNS 112 is a great class to take, particularly if you have any previous working knowledge of Chinese. Although everyone in the class is a \"heritage learner,\" there are varying degrees of proficiency among the students. If you are looking for an easy grade, CHNS 110 might be a better suggestion. But if you stick with CHNS 112, the class definitely springboards off of your previous knowledge, and the learning experience is much different (and in my opinion, more beneficial) than starting from scratch.",
    "Very good for students who speak Chinese at home but have little literary skills",
    "Yes I definitely recommend his class if you're like me and grew up speaking household chinese but had no idea what chinese grammar was and very sparse experience with writing characters. The class is demanding in terms of memorization but not difficult. It's actually somewhat of a reprieve from other more analytical courses.",
    "If you need a language credit, and are Chinese, you might as well take it.",
    "If you're from a Chinese speaking background and want to seriously improve your Chinese, take it. The work load will be high with a quiz everyday, and tests and oral exams every two weeks or so. The weekend quizzes and lessons will be a pain in the ass. But they are all extremely useful in making sure you actually learn the material, and you'll come away with a much better understanding of the language.",
    "It's a fairly basic intensive introduction to mostly reading Chinese. Reading is about 60%, writing 30%, and pronunciation 10%. Of the reading, grammar dominates the topic of discussion.As you have little choice, the question is whether you should take Chinese over other languages. A course evaluation would not help you in this case.",
    "Chinese 112 is an introductory Chinese class, but because it is directed towards heritage speakers is very intensive. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, not only is it necessary it forms a solid foundation for Chinese.",
    "If you grew up speaking conversational Chinese but never bothered to learn the written language, this class is perfect for you. If you\u0092re anything different, this class is really not meant for you; kids who had learned characters in Sunday school had a sizeable advantage, and kids whose Mandarin was not at par or only knew different dialects like Cantonese and Shanghai-nese were at an extreme disadvantage.The class is taught in complete Mandarin from day 1. It aims to teach you the correct and formal grammar that you\u0092ve been neglecting when speaking at home. You learn around 300 characters by the end of the class, making it the most practically useful course I took this semester.Yale\u0092s Chinese department is excellent and this course is no exception. We alternated between Professor Liang and Professor Liu each week, and they were both stellar. As long as you\u0092re at the Chinese competency that I mentioned earlier, don\u0092t be afraid of this course. It\u0092s designed for freshmen; if you can put in 60-75 minutes of homework\/practice each night, you will do well. Having class every day added a sense of consistency to my schedule.Take this class, it's a great one. The material is extremely useful, and the teachers make the class enjoyable."
