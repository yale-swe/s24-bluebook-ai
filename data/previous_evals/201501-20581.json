    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as a way to broaden one's perspective on historical writing and scholarship and to hone new skills in reading and writing history.",
    "yes!",
    "A course that teaches you to write history in such a way that gives it a narrative feel. Yes I actually think several classes like this should be required for all grad students.",
    "If you want to reexamine all the assumptions you have ever made about what it means to write history, take this class. It will completely alter your view of history.",
    "Anyone interested in writing and history should take this course and explore the possibilities that narrative and creative writing can offer historians.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, although I think it would benefit from separate graduate and undergraduate sections. The class worked fine, as is, but I think students would have had an easier time interacting with and critiquing each other's work if they were solely working with their own peer group.",
    "This class discusses the methods and controversies of writing history with narrative style. This class gives you experience in writing with creativity and interest instead of with just dry argument.",
    "Highly recommended if you want to write better, more effective and tell a story rather than just state the facts and, of course, use the sources. Demos' class is a must--and one of a kind--if you want to write narrative."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to consider the study and writing of history in new ways and to practice engaging them in my own writing. I have been exposed to historians, subject matter, and historical methods that complements what I have learned in the past.",
    "It created a new way to think about my own work.",
    "As I go forward in my career as a historian, I hope to take the lessons I learned in this class with me. I want to write history that people want to read. I want to look beyond fact and explore human experience. I think this is the best way to teach history. Thank you for this reminder Professor Demos.",
    "This class exposed me to the narrative tradition of history. I do not think I will work much with narrative history in the future, but I appreciate it having some experience with it and think I will be more mindful about the storytelling aspects of historical scholarship going forward.",
    "This course did not deepen my knowledge of history, but it did open up new possibilities within the history profession. This course is absolutely aiding me in my Master's thesis writing.",
    "see above. really helpful in both the research and writing aspect of dissertation and\/or senior essay or any writing assignment(s) for that matter."
