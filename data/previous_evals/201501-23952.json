   "comments": [
    "YES! Fun, low workload, and a great way to explore outside your comfort zone and pick up a new skill.",
    "I recommend this if you want to improve your technique and are ready and willing to put in time outside of class to paint.",
    "Definitely! I wish I had taken more art classes at Yale from the start. It's a great excuse to use a different part of your brain and do something different!",
    "This is an incredible, \"that's why I chose Yale\" course. It is so enjoyable to learn about artists and learn to paint yourself, and it's a very low-pressure environment. I came in with no painting experience at all and never felt behind the class or embarrassed for my skill level. Professor Van Doren is a wonderful and kind teacher, and you will learn a great deal about painting and about famous watercolorists from the last few centuries!",
    "Lots of fun. A refreshing change of pace. You make pretty things! It's super chill and super easy. TAKE IT IF YOU CAN. WHO DOESN'T LOVE AMATEUR WATERCOLORING!?!?",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Adam is a wonderful person who will make you laugh and see the world in new colors. You will almost definitely improve your painting skill by the end of the course no matter what your level in the beginning.",
    "Take it - incredible course regardless of whether or not you are a painter- I learned so much and can actually paint now.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. I don't care if you've never picked up a paint brush in your life. It doesn't matter. This class will give you an excuse to chill out for a couple hours each week. You get to slow down and paint (terribly) FOR A GRADE. And you actually do end up seeing the world differently and making things that you're proud of!",
    "Take it!",
    "Even if you're no good at watercolor painting youll almost certainly enjoy this course. It's as time-consuming as you want it to be, but probably isnt worth taking if you cant do at least one painting every week outside of class. Field trips to museums and the artist visit were highlights; even the term paper is fun! Materials provided, but you may want to\/have to supplement with a trip to Hull's for extra paints and paper. Recommended for non-art majors.",
    "A painting class so get ready to paint! There isn't too much guidance for beginners (like me), but you will pick up some good techniques. Professor Van Doren is a very sweet teacher,",
    "So fun! Take it if you can get in! If you are a senior, keep trying hard to get in off the wait list. Be persistent. This is a great 5th class Credit\/D for seniors. You will never take another class like this one!"
