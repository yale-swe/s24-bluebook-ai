    "This was a good class! We ended up being very few in number, which meant that people came very prepared to discussions. Some of the material was quite difficult (especially some of the German works like Nietzche and Benjamin) but Professor Billings did a good job answering our questions and bringing out the meanings. I particularly enjoyed the earlier part of the course, focused on some Greek tragedies and then adaptations (Seneca, Racine). Only take this course if you're ready and excited to do all of the reading.",
    "If you are interested in tragedy - works and theory - this class is good. It is fast paced though, covering about two plays a week. The last third of the class is mostly theories of tragedy. The reading load is manageable. As this is a once a week seminar, the quality of discussion really depends on the students in the class."
