   "comments": [
    "I learned an incredible amount about the four bodies of work studied (Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Donne) and about the nature of literary analysis. The course also taught me how to write well, although this isn't an overt focus of the course.",
    "I gained more familiarity with canonical texts, in addition to a fuller understanding of a specific period in the development of the English language.",
    "I learned how to closely read texts and analyze them for form and meaning. I refined my skills to formulate and articulate arguments particularly in regards to literate.",
    "The course was extremely beneficial for me personally. I had no background in classical literature, and this served as a great exposure to the classics. I gained the ability to analyze, deconstruct, and challenge the assertions made in the literature. I understand there is a correlation between the Western Canon, as the works relate to one another in a variety of ways.",
    "How to better read poetry and analyze texts, especially close-reading",
    "We read some of the foundational texts of English literature. So much modern literature stems from them that being familiar is a necessity for being able to fully appreciate and analyze later works.",
    "This course really helped me refine both my way of thinking about literature and my writing style teaching me to be more rigorous in my arguments, definition of terms, and the consideration I gave my reader."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is a great introduction to the major english poets and literary analysis, but can be a little difficult to follow at times if one ahsn't read classical literature.",
    "I would have liked considerations of race, class, and gender to have felt more organic to the conversation. When questions raised, they were presented as \"alternate readings,\" rather than conclusions we arrived at by engaging with the texts. We weren't quite instructed in how to approach the text critically ourselves, but, rather, were handed interpretations. I do like the pace of the course. We spend plenty of time on each reading.",
    "The course could include female writers as part of the core group of studies works. The corse does give a good foundation in particular parts of English literature overall though.",
    "English 125 is a necessary foundation for the study of english language and literature.",
    "I wish that we learned how to formulate texts and our responses to essays better. However, I wish that we had gone more in depth on how to write\/respond to poetry texts.",
    "Its syllabus is good and pacing is reasonable, though I wish we had spent more time on Shakespeare's poetry. Maybe it just felt shorter than the other sections. The structure of the class and discussions hardly ever changed, so you could pretty much expect to read, discuss, write about, and repeat with each new author. There weren't many exciting ways to shake things up or keep it interesting besides the texts itself.",
    "I appreciated the degree to which Prof. Minnis supplemented our readings of canonical works with theory\/criticism\/\"non-canonical\" poetry. However, I wish that our discussions could have been better there was a small group of people who regularly participated, and the rest of the class seemed very disengaged most of the time."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they feel like they have a very strong background in literature and writing. If you have any interest in the topic, this class will be extremely rewarding.",
    "It's nice to be guaranteed a spot in a seminar, where there will always be a chance to learn and get to know other students.",
    "If you're interested in majoring in english, it's a good gauge to see if certain parts of the major would appeal to you.",
    "For anybody who wishes to be an english major, this a necessary course, and the poetry read in the module is essential both to further study and one's growth as a feeling human.",
    "This course is a challenging initial course but if you can overcome the initial hurdles, it does pay off. It has much to offer in terms of technical and stylistic knowledge but it requires that you develop a keen sense of detail and awareness. The ability to think critically and engage with the material is a must to succeed in the course. I do not recommend non-English major take the course.",
    "Yes, I think it is important, especially for someone planning to study English. The texts are really great and make for enjoyable reading overall. Also, there are five writing assignments of varying lengths (ranging from three to eight pages), which are helpful for practicing writing for for different lengths and purposes.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend it. Make sure that you go to office hours I found Prof. Minnis to be most helpful in that context, where he could give you individualized feedback on your writing\/performance. Also, make sure you do the readings with enough time to spare, so that you can go back and seriously think about them\/take notes; this is a class where it's very hard to get by on superficial interpretations."
