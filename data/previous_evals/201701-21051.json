   "comments": [
    "This was overall a really great course, where each class session included some great, brief lecture from Professor Quintman, often student presenters, and the open discussion. The class used a very interesting and eclectic selection of readings. I do have one suggestion here, though: that each reading be accompanied by some supplementary (very short) reading or paragraph, which just tells you what kind of tradition(s) it belongs to and a little history about it to put it in context. We often learned about that kind of thing in class, but I found myself wishing I knew more while I was doing the reading. I also wish I knew more about how the different topics we covered in class intersected, in a historical and cultural respect. Professor Quintman provided a glossary of meditation terms, but I think even a much more broad glossary would have been useful, including terms like \"dzogchen\" and \"zen\" and \"Chan\" and \"madhyamaka,\" etc. Perhaps the class could be involved in the construction of such a glossary.",
    "I really enjoyed the more literary readings -- like the Way of the Bodhisattva and the Birth of Insight. I had a hard time *really* understanding some of the more technical readings. I could read them, but it didn't really feel like I was retaining the core ideas. More time in class learning *how* to read the texts would be nice, but I guess it's hard because there are such varying backgrounds in the class. I liked the weekly presentations, but it would be nice if there was a harder cap on the time limit -- some people dragged on and you could feel the mood in the room fall.",
    "Overall a great class! Wonderful guest speakers and class discussions!"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. If you are interested in this subject (Buddhist meditation) I think you will get a lot out of the course. Overall it's a very interesting and enjoyable class, and Professor Quintman is fantastic.",
    "I recommend this class if you understand that it is a course on technical and niche Buddhist religious texts. The reading can definitely be hard, but it's cool to learn new things about Buddhism and the field of religious studies. The workload is very manageable. Professor Quintman is lovely.",
    "Wonderful course if you're interested in meditation from a historical perspective"
