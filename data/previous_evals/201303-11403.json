    "Take it! If you love Shakespeare, you must take it. Lots of memorizing, but worth it.",
    "A fantastic course! There's more work involved (i.e. rehearsal, memorization) than might appear from the syllabus, but every step is delightful. Ask Prof. Biggs to challenge you, and he will--I recommend that you do so. You will grow. Audition; take this course. This is one of those classes where you are asked to give your all, and you will want to give even more. Take it!",
    "Great course. Exposes you to a lot of material and, of course, to the basics of acting prose. Can easily be taken as a 5th class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to any other student; if you have the chance to take it, do it! It's an intense acting seminar with bits and pieces of history and literature in there. Murray is a gem.",
    "If Murray is teaching, take this class if for no other reason than to take a class with Murray. But, it will definitely give you insight into how to perform and handle Shakespearean text while still being light and fun."
