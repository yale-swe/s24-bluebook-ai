    "the course was excellent. Although I found it extremely beneficial that the instructor allowed us to select our analysis software (SAS, R, SPSS, SATA), and even though the instructor made enormous effort to cover guidance for each program, I feel that this added a layer of complexity and took time from teaching the material.Yet, I feel the value of allowing students to select their preferred software is great, and appreciate that option very much. I think in the future, there should be TA's that are experienced in all software students are using in the course. The TA's at CSSSI were very helpful with understanding SAS from a high level, but were not always familiar with the content we were covering in class.",
    "Wonderful instructor! However, I had trouble understanding the material. This was in part due to my limited background in stats, but I think the course may have been a little too fast paced as well. I know there's a lot of material to cover, but if the lectures were a little easier to absorb, then I would feel like I have a much better grasp of the material. Either that, or make the intro the stats course a prerequisite."

    "the professor! it's a lot of material and some of it is really hard to conceptualize but he did a great job of presenting things in several different ways so that students stuff out no matter how they think about math.",
    "Dr. Reuning-Scherer is excellent--he made lectures engaging and notes provided for lectures were complete and comprehensive. I really liked that he encourages use of students' own data for homework assignments, as this makes the analyses more meaningful.",
    "Teacher, homeworks",
    "Excellent lecturerMultiple software packages to select fromInstructor went above and beyond to be available for studentsHomeworks' were an *excellent* way to complement the fast-paced lecture style",
    "statistical methods are very useful. office hours are useful.",
    "Learning various statistic technique",
    "Well organized and there were plenty of help sessions. The homework was useful",
    "The course provides a great overview of multivariate statistics with an emphasis on application. Homework assignments and the final project allow you to work on a project of your own interest, provided you have the data available. The homework assignments also allow ample time to explore the different statistical programs out there.",
    "The course gave me a good understanding of how to use a variety of statistical programs.",
    "Professor knows what is the point of learning and dealing with statistics for most of students; he provides exactly what students need in understanding a certain concept of statistics. I didn't have to struggle with all stat equations or mathematical parts, allowing me focus more on principles and applications of those concepts."

This was very helpful, I just wish I took it before I conducted the survey (spring of last year) rather than this year and I would have organized things a little differently in the survey. I definitely feel much more confident with analyzing social science data after this course. I'm really considering a PhD now and had been pretty intimidated before.",

I also work in GIS and remote sensing, where some of these techniques also come into play (although usually in background processes). I wanted a solid foundation of understanding in multivariate statistics so I could be prepared for these instances.",
