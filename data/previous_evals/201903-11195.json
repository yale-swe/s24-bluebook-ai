   "comments": [
    "We (more or less) followed Carnie's standard syntax textbook.",
    "I've definitely developed more of an appreciation for both the minute technicalities of Syntax and the overall way Linguistics works (like how people think about the way humans learn languages, how languages differ\/relate to each other, etc.)",
    "I gained an understanding of syntactic theory and the way linguists make abstractions. Specifically, we covered categories, constituency, X-bar theory, DP movement, Wh-movement, and theta roles.",
    "I learned a good deal of syntax, and I also learned how to go about approaching linguistic structure in a systematic and sound way. It's pretty fascinating, and is also sometimes made more interesting by the field's relative youth and some of its lingering uncertainties.",
    "All the basics of syntax theory. Realized (to my surprise) that syntax is a relatively young field and that the jury is still out on many things - this put some people off but I was drawn in...listen to what Professor Zanuttini says in the first class about how syntax is the same across ALL languages ever! If the class ever gets dry then just think back to that and it is fascinating. I took this as a fun class senior year which most people would think was crazy but Im glad I did",
    "The x-bar theory approach to syntax, and more broadly, how to learn a system youre not sure you agree with",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of syntax: different parameters in different languages, movement, Theta-criterion, X-bar theory, and so on.",
    "Syntax I is a broad overview of (1) syntactic concepts and (2) X-bar and theta theory. The course begins by introducing evidence for syntactic structure, constituents, and linguistic argumentation. It then progresses to covering phrase structure rules and X-bar theory (at this point, tree drawing is introduced) before covering theta theory to constrain it. Movement is discussed in the context of head-to-head movement, DP movement, wh-movement, focus movement, and case theory. This course is good at covering the basics of syntax and will get you up to speed so that you can understand syntactic arguments (for example, by the end of the course you can try your hand at reading some syntax papers, although this isn't really part of the course, more of a Syntax II thing I believe).",
    "This was an excellent introduction to modern syntactic theory, even if X-bar theory is a bit outdated.",
    "Syntax; how we model our language(s) General topics in Linguistics Variety of cool linguistic phenomena",
    "I learned a lot about the structure of language and various syntactic theories proposed for understanding it. I gained analytical skills from the problem sets (which I found to be very fun) and applied the skills on the exams. Topics touched upon in class included: categories and phrasal structure, binding theory, complements and adjuncts, x-bar theory, theta theory, and different types of movement. I also learned a lot about trees and how to diagram sentences.",
    "I learned a lot about the structure of language. You learn how sentences are mapped out within our minds, and get to draw trees for many different kinds of sentences. I learned a lot of things about language that makes sense but which I never stopped to think about. It's a really cool class!",
    "I learned what the field of syntax in linguistics was and gained a basic understanding of the underlying principles and methods in syntax. I learned how to break down a sentence into its syntactic structure via drawing a tree. I gained a better sense of how sentences are formed and how languages are learned and understood in this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Zanuttini was a great professor! So engaging, so nice, and she really connects with her students.",
    "Strengths: Raffaella is nice and willing to discuss what students are interested in; workload is usually light enough. Weaknesses: material is a bit contrived and fake; class discussion (and section) often feels like an inefficient use of time; grading is weirdly nit-picky.",
    "I think one weakness, which is difficult to control, comes from the enormous range of ability and predisposition that students come to the class with. Some have never taken a formal linguistics course, but are used to the systematic\/formal way rules apply. Others struggle a lot with this even if they've already taken a linguistics course. I think the instructors strove to try and keep everyone engaged, but sometimes it felt like the more advanced students' questions took over class discussion at the expense of the less-sure students. I think Raffaella is the course's strength because she is a wonderful professor who not only is an expert, but also really cares about her students and makes herself readily available to them. Raffaella is the best!",
    "This course was very clear and straightforward. The instructor is wonderful, and the book is pretty good. One thing that was challenging was that lecture would often turn into a discussion. If you understood the material, it was really stimulating and exciting to challenge and explore new ideas. But if you came to lecture needing some more explanation of the reading, sometimes things got very confusing and you couldn't really find answers. Maybe just a little more structure in lecture, but other than that it was great.",
    "I though it was well structures. I will say that while in my opinion never too especially difficult, the difficulty did increase sharply after the first mid-term, which I think may have come as a perhaps-unwelcome surprise to some. Another thing is that over the course we continuously revise our linguistic model. I do think this is the best way to go about the course, although it does come with the drawback that after we conclude something and use it for a while, it might just change completely.",
    "Strengths are Professor Zanuttini - shes so passionate and introduces the material well. Additionally, the theory behind the material is fascinating. Weaknesses come about from the fact that this class is required for the linguistics major and there are clearly a lot of people who dont want to be there. As a result the class moves VERY slowly and the grade boundaries are really high and come down more to pedantry than to intellect",
    "Textbook and lecture sometimes conflicted, expectations for homework werent always clear, but lecture was engaging and the prof did her best to answer everybodys questions even when there were a LOT of questions",
    "I thought this class was very engaging: there was a lot of participation, discussion, and interaction each time we met. I also appreciated the weekly office hours\/section & I felt like I had ample opportunities for my questions to be answered. Setting pset deadlines and test dates were always somewhat democratically decided, which was helpful. I also extremely appreciated how quickly we would get every assignment and test back with a lot of feedback so that we knew how to improve in the future. I only wish that the rules were more fixed. There were a few instances in which we would draw sentence trees for very similar\/the same type of sentence in several different ways depending on the day & this caused a bit of confusion for me when preparing for the final (for example: how often do we use PassP instead of placing the copula in the T?). I'm sure part of the time, it was my own fault, but other times, the rules could have been made more clear.",
    "Strengths: The professor and teaching fellow were absolutely marvelous. The material covered was interesting, and the class was taught at a very reasonable pace. The workload is pretty light (one pset a week, two are optional and one is dropped, and each takes maybe 2 hours to do). For comparison, this class is easily half the workload of Phonology I. Tests are fair, although they are a little bit tricky in that the professor will sometimes put questions on the exam which deal with concepts not yet covered in class and expect you to make some inferences. The grading is very fair\/generous, and the professor and TF spent an amazing amount of time conducting review sessions during reading week for us, which is really meaningful. It's very clear that professor Zanuttini cares deeply about her students, and she is so kind and smart and knowledgeable. Class itself is a joy to attend. Weaknesses: One of the difficulties with syntax, or linguistics in general, is that it walks the line between having and not having objective answers. One of the benefits of that is that it often feels like there are lots of unanswered questions that are very interesting and very accessible to understand. The downside is that, if you have a question about something, the answer given can sometimes be really unfulfilling. That's not a fault with the class per se, but if you go into it with the expectation of \"there is a set of things to learn which will explain these phenomena,\" you might get frustrated when that isn't met. Another point of frustration with the field (there's no real way around this) is that much of the argumentation used in the class relies on your own grammaticality judgements....which may not line up with the way a lesson is presented at all. Not much to do about that, but it's worth understanding that you might feel like \"everything we're doing in class is just wrong and made up.\" Additionally, towards the second half of term what is taught in class begins to deviate from what is presented in the textbook (Carnie) in a meaningful way, to the point that the book will give answers or explanations which in class we consider wrong or vague. This makes it harder to study for these parts of class, and in many ways it would be better if there were a text we could follow which matched more closely with what is taught in class. I'm not sure if such a book exists, and Carnie is a good book nonetheless, but prepare to be a bit confused when dealing with voice and movement especially.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is very rigorous and gets you to reframe everything you thought you knew about grammar. As for weaknesses, I feel like we could have referred to other analyses of syntactic phenomena, especially in regards to the Theta Criterion. Everyone felt a bit uncomfortable with theta roles, and yet we didn't talk about alternatives like Lexical Conceptual Structure. This isn't too big a deal, but I kinda wish we could've learned Minimalism in this course. There are a couple textbooks that use it, like the one by Radford. Just a thought.",
    "Strengths: The material itself was interesting for the most part, and Prof. Zanuttini made it a pleasure to explore the topics. She allowed class to pretty much be a dialog between her and the students making it much more engaging and allowing a better understanding of why we choose certain explanations. The weekly HWs nicely reflected the focus of both class time and exams. HWs and Exams I thought were quite fair. Weaknesses: The biggest weakness is just sort of part of the content, there is some ambiguity in how we ought to do things. This is as a result of the approach we took, developing the system from the ground up, replacing methods as we \"found\" better ones, however this caused some (slight) confusions on how we ought to do things. Furthermore, it felt at certain points that the content got a little hand-wavy, but these stretches were short lived, and in general the content was clear and well-motivated.",
    "Strengths include connecting the topics covered in class with the ones in the book and the exams following a similar format to the problem sets. The professor and teaching assistant were also very willing to help answer questions and fairly graded assignments. A weakness included classes sometimes going off topic due to questions asked by students (although the main points of the lesson were still covered). An improvement could be having all of the problem sets due online by midnight (like we began to incorporate toward the end of the semester), as weeks varied in terms of commitments and completing the problem sets by the class deadline on weeks where I did not anticipate needing an extension (but discovered too late that I did) was difficult.",
    "Professor Zanuttini is amazing, she's super kind and very interesting and knowledgeable. I enjoyed the assignments, they were quite interesting with a variety of problems. The TA Siri is also incredible. The only weakness is sometimes they cover things needed for the homework the class before it's due",
    "The strength of this course is that it presupposes no linguistics or syntax knowledge, but is still interesting and and introduces new knowledge to someone with plenty of experience in other areas of linguistics without being tedious or boring. Additionally, it does an excellent job of taking students from no knowledge of syntax to mastery over the basics of syntax and introduces some more advanced concepts in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! I've never taken any linguistics courses before, but I thought this class was super interesting and just the right level of difficulty! You get a cheat sheet on the exams which is awesome, and the psets aren't too hard.",
    "If you already know that you like the discipline of syntax as currently taught\/studied, then this could be a good course for you because Raffaella is nice and syntax is her area of specialty. Otherwise, the pseudo-science aspect of this social science course will be frustrating. You will be able to tolerate this course only if you have low critical-thinking skills, a high tolerance for bullshit, or both. Unfortunately, this is what modern linguistics (at least as practiced by the department at Yale) has come to. Also, we were told at the beginning of the semester that there would be section only on a select few weeks when we especially needed to review concepts, but that was FAKE NEWS and we had a complete-waste-of-time section every single week of the semester.",
    "I would recommend that someone takes the course Credit\/D unless they need it for their major and are ready for the amount of work required. If you're not prone to this kind of thinking, this class is a lot of work--it's not an easy class by any standard. I think it's well worth the intellectual challenge and I found p-sets to be a nice break in my week, but I definitely stressed myself out over this class a lot. This was especially true at the beginning of the year when I didn't give myself enough time to do the psets. This also was true during both midterms because I (as a humanities major) am not used to the process of studying a lot for a test and then doing really poorly on it. But Raffaella and Sirry were both really available during office hours for extra help, so that definitely saved me.",
    "Yes. I probably wouldn't take this class again knowing what I know now, but there are a few reasons for that. The material becomes very abstract very quickly, and it was very easy to get confused because of all the new assumptions we were making each lecture. The professor was excellent, but sometimes I found myself questioning the value of a particular modification of the model. If you are very excited by linguistics and are good at math\/abstract thinking, this is a course for you.",
    "Yeah I think it's an interesting look at language from an analytical perspective that most people wouldn't necessarily encounter otherwise. I find most things are fascinating once you look at them closely enough, and language is certainly no exception. That we use such a complicated system constantly and effortlessly is amazing, so even though the course doesn't give all the definitive answers, it's a worthwhile exploration.",
    "Yes but only if you are passionate about languages and linguistic theory. Also you have to keep an open mind, and I would only recommend taking if Professor Zanuttini is teaching. If you are taking it because you have to then I feel bad for you",
    "Yes, doesnt matter if youre stem or humanities, I think youll like it and maybe even find it useful",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, particularly those who enjoy\/are good at abstraction. Though this is not a quantitative class, it does involve some logic & problem-solving, as someone who enjoys both -- I wholeheartedly enjoyed the content within this class. I don't think the workload is too bad, and I thought it was a really cool foray into one area of cognitive science (learning about an ability of the brain unique to humans).",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in language at all, this is a really fascinating introduction to grammar which really makes you think about why you speak the way that you do. If you're a LING major, you've gotta take it, but hey, it's super fun so enjoy it! The workload isn't bad at all, and we had so many birthdays in class that we had cake like every other week essentially. Seriously, it's an interesting class taught by a great professor with a dedicated TF (shoutout to Sirry!)",
    "Yes... but make sure you're ready to see how different linguists talk about syntax compared to how language intructors do. Language pedagogy often feels behind theoretical linguistics, so there's a lot of stuff in this class that may surprise you. Be prepared and don't get too stressed about not using the traditional taxonomic approach to syntax.",
    "Yes. I had no previous experience in linguistics (which was a slight nuisance at the beginning when everyone is using fancy words you've never heard, but doesn't end up mattering since Prof. Zanuttini can immediately clarify any questions you have) and this class showed me how cool of a subject this is, especially syntax, where we try to make systematic sense of how we put together constituents creating content. Was fun to think about different possible explanations and how to fit all the data, and Prof. Zanuttini was totally engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student, especially those with a more language-oriented or analytical mind. I found the topics to be very fascinating and the class itself to be an open space where any ideas and questions were welcomed without judgement.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the subject or in linguistics! The professor is amazing and the homeworks are interesting, there's not too much reading, all in all a wonderful course!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was very engaging and did a great job of introducing the field comprehensively.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. I love Raffaella and her teaching style, and think it was a great first Linguistics class to take. It definitely got me very interested in the subject matter, to the point where I was (and still am) considering majoring in Linguistics."
