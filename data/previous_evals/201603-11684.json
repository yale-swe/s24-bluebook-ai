   "comments": [
    "This is mainly due to the structure of Spanish 110 more generally as an immersive language course (being taught in Spanish from Day 1), but I learned a surprising amount of Spanish in a matter of a few months to the point of being somewhat conversational with certain topics. Another important aspect of the course that I believe could be expanded on is the section in which the students learn about the cultures of various Hispanic cultures, especially the differences between Iberian Hispanic and Latinoamerican Hispanic societies.",
    "The fully immersed Spanish class encouraged me to practice speaking and understanding the language. I learned important vocabulary and grammar that allowed me to already apply these skills in the real world.",
    "I learned elementary Spanish vocabulary and how to conjugate verbs in the present tense, past tense, and imperfect tense",
    "I gained a basic knowledge of Spanish and was able to hold a conversation by the end of the class.",
    "I gained a very comprehensive introductory understanding of Spanish. Although listening was difficult for me, I feel like a greatly improved in the written, oral, and reading aspects of the language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I cannot think of 'weaknesses' in the sense of how the class is flawed, but rather of ways in which the class could be even better for future students. As this is an introduction to the Spanish langauge, the speaking pace is slower than it would be in more advanced classes, but I feel that it would be helpful to incorporate more listening activities that take place at conversational pace, such as airing Spanish-language news channels at the beginning of class or watching more clips from the films of Pedro Almodvar; I also feel that these listening activities may also be used to further elucidate the differences between the Latinoamerican and Iberian dialects of Spanish. I also feel that the Oral Exam may be improved by changing its structure from the description of a picture to a conversation with the instructor about a random topic; I feel that this structure may be more directly helpful for students of Spanish because it seems to be a more versatile skill than describing what is occurring in an image.",
    "The strengths were the immersion aspect of the course, but that also made it difficult to understand words to which you knew no other synonyms in Spanish. The instructor's presentations were interesting and culturally significant.",
    "Great teaching by Professor Glenski. Always looked forward to this class. No suggestions to be made.",
    "Strengths: speaking Spanish in class daily homework Weaknesses: don't go over a lot of the vocab in class",
    "I thought the course was taught very well overall, however I think it would benefit by having more of the assignments done in class be collected. There were many times where students would be asked to do a writing or answer questions and the teacher would come around and read through what we had done, however i think allowing the professor to have a real look at the work, would then allow them to give better feedback and catch some of the smaller details to help students improve more.",
    "This course was great in that it challenged me to develop my speaking skills and actually practice what we were learning. I think it could use more instruction rather than activity."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly reccommend this course to any student who plans to do any kind of work (especially activism or social work) in the United States or do work in any Spanish-speaking society since the course even in the L1 level makes it clear that the goal of the Spanish course series is not to achieve a piecemeal knowledge of certain linguistic mechanics, but a living fluency.",
    "Spanish is a very useful language to speak and understand, and the Yale program has many strengths.",
    "Yes, my professor slowed down to help every student without ruining the learning experience for others.",
    "Yes, it provides more practice with spanish than a typical L1 class because the professor speaks in spanish during class which allows for more listening practice. Students are also not allowed to speak english in class which provides more practice as well.",
    "Yes, because this is a good course for anyone seeking to learn Spanish and gain an interest in the culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course."
