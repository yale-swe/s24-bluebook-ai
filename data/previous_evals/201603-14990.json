   "comments": [
    "I'll never look at media or elections in the same way and in a time when there was so much turmoil and confusion around the 2016 presidential election, it was beneficial to navigate the causes and presumed effects with Professor Blow",
    "Overview of the problematic ways in which mainstream media covers national elections, including political polling, prediction markets, fact checking, and punditry. Brief foray into the financial incentives of media companies and the political biases afflicting them.",
    "I really thought critically about",
    "Charles Blow emphasized in a recent column that President-elect Donald Trumps words and actions are not normal. It might just be his unorthodox erraticism, however, that breathes new life into the responsibility of true journalists and anchors. If the media wishes to make the most of the crossroads with which Donald Trumps election has presented them, they must avoid the path of least resistance - a path that would only lead to a world where ratings and cheap entertainment value intoxicate the public into passive acceptance of authoritarianism. If the Fourth Estate wishes to defend Americas free and open society, it must give voice to multiple perspectives, remain steadfastly objective and provide quality coverage. Taking the high road might be tiresome, but for the sake of our democracy, the American media must rise to the occasion.",
    "Very little. Interesting conversations, but I learned astoundingly little.",
    "Very few. Professor Blow's insights into the world of televised and print media were interesting nonetheless.",
    "I learned how to write more like a journalist, which is a good skill to have in the long run--being able to write well on a deadline will come in handy. Taking this class and discussing the election in real time was fascinating and helped me put the election from Hell in a new perspective.",
    "We studied the intersection of two institutions in the midst of major transformations: the political campaign industry and the news business. We discussed presidential campaign coverage during the last third of the twentieth century, including the beleaguered economic structure of the news business in the twenty-first century; media coverage of the 2008 and 2012 presidential races; and, in particular, the rise of Trump.",
    "I learned more in this class than I was expecting going in. Not only did I learn a lot about political campaigns, but having Charles Blow present during discussions of political coverage provided me with so many insights into the inner workings of media corporations. Each discussion felt like it had a line tethered to reality--to application--instead of drifting off into the theoretical world of deep academia. And with how crazy this election cycle turned out to be, I ended up wanting to research more about the course material than was required. Hell, this class informed my thesis topic, and will likely inform my post-graduate career as well.",
    "We learned about the media's role in the 2016 election."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I personally appreciated Blow's lecturing because I wanted to learn more about media and its role in elections but I know many classmates wished they would have been able to speak more in class.",
    "One of the greatest strengths is obviously that the professor is intimately aware of the inner workings of many major media companies. He is passionate about media serving a role as the fourth estate, and he is opinionated about the way in which media, as it is currently structured, is harmful and can be improved. Additionally, he is charismatic man and exceptionally interesting to listen to. If the assignments and course material were honed and workshopped more rigorously, the course would have benefited immensely. Most of this material frankly could have been covered in five or six efficient classes. I doubt that Professor Blow spent much time preparing the arch of each class, and even if he did, the seminar discussion itself was not run skillfully enough to prevent useless digression (a risk with any visiting professor and, honestly, an indictment of Yales failure to effectively prep visiting professors more than an indictment of the professor himself). Additionally, the assignments in the class were useless; each of the four writings asked minor variations of the same question and were not intellectually compelling (e.g. is the media fairly covering a particular incident or the election as a whole, and what can they learn moving forward).",
    "The course material was fascinating, and Charles is an incredibly interesting and engaging guy -- he really makes the course. However, he also doesn't have a lot of teaching experience so the course was sometimes disorganized and it was very unclear what he wanted from assignments\/how he made grading decisions.",
    "Professor talked too much, readings were rather useless, assignments required fact-driven information not provided by classroom discussions or readings.",
    "Professor Blow, while obviously brilliant and an expert in this topic, at times was unstructured in his teaching, and the class veered away from discussion and more towards monologue or question and answer later in the semester. I've always found moderated discussion to be the best method of learning, and this class would have benefited from a stronger structure.",
    "I thought the discussions we had in class were productive and informative. I felt as though everyone was given a say and that Blow never shut anyone down or made those with, maybe, differing political views feel uncomfortable. The material was interesting and relevant, obviously. One thing I would change, should a course like this be offered again, is to have more in-class writing assignments before the midterm. I know that I felt, as someone who is not used to writing on a deadline and for whom it take an hour to think of a good thesis statement, let alone write 4 good and interesting pages, like a fish out of water. I think this could be remedied through more short, in-class writing assignments that would help students practice and learn.",
    "This was, hands down, the single worst class I've ever had the misfortune of taking at Yale. Professor Charles Blow was a joke. He was on campus once a week for four hours and held office hours only 3 times. He was rude, smug, and astonishingly unprofessional. It became quite clear over the course of the semester that he was only interested in putting \"Yale\"on his resum. This seminar had less than 20 students. He never even bothered to learn any of our names. His assignments were vague (at best). Each paper was a shot in the dark; we had no guidelines and he appeared to grade based on his whims. Never hire Charles Blow again.",
    "It was definitely an experimental course--and one that will be hard to replicate. Having a working professional like Charles Blow lead discussions was one of those unique, world-class experiences that one can only dream about, and the discussions we had in class were always really in-depth. At the same time, I got the sense that the course would have been better formatted as a series of workshops or a masterclass. Prof. Blow didn't seem that interested in the assignment portion of the class, and I think as the semester went on, the student-professor relationship soured a bit as people wanted to discuss grades more.",
    "This class was not my favoritenot only because of the exceptionally depressing subject material (though fascinating), but also because of our professors tendency toward unavailability. Never have I had the experience of a professor consistently ending a class thirty minutes early and feeling angry that we wouldnt get to discuss more of the latest disaster of democracy. That said, the course was obviously a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; I only wish Professor Blow had thought similarly. In other words, the first time I, for one, heard the word office hours, was during our final class meeting."

   "comments": [
    "Once in a lifetime opportunity, literally. Extremely grateful to the opportunity to have reviewed this historic election with Professor Blow.",
    "Eh. Professor Blow is incredibly articulate, principled, and idiosyncratic, and its really a privilege to hear him discuss modern media every week. The issue is, he knows that, and it drives him to be a generally aloof, underprepared instructor. When he is willing to engage with students after class (when something in his life or the world is not blowing up), hes super interesting to talk to. Most of the time, however, he cant wait to leave. I think the lack of leadership and preparation in this class is crippling, and it affects the assignments (which are intellectually boring and repetitive) and the readings (which are scant and unenlightening). Overall, Id recommend Cr\/D-ing this class as a fifth or sixth credit to hear him talk and not have high expectations or obligations for the work or reading.",
    "If the course (or a similar media\/politics one) is offered again in the future, I would recommend taking it for Charles, because he's really interesting and very funny and engaging. It's worth taking just to get to hang out with him for two hours every week -- every time we came into class, we were all just excited to hear about his thoughts from the past week. BUT his grading is very unpredictable. I might recommend taking the course credit\/D -- I kind of wish I had.",
    "I would recommend this class. Charles Blow's perspective and passion with which he expresses his views is all too rare on Yale's campus.",
    "Nope. Blow likes to hear himself speak more than anything and imposes ridiculous expectations on assignments, but never articulates what he wants. I learned little, but enjoyed class conversations when Blow wasn't bloviating. Would only take for an easy class if Credit\/D",
    "Given the nature of the course, this question isn't relevant; but no, I would not. Charles Blow, while an insightful and intelligent editorial writer, clearly has neither the capacity nor the inclination to be an instructor of comparable quality. In addition to his poor pedagogy, which was haphazard and unacademic, I am quite certain that after thirteen weeks he didn't know any of our names. He was unable or unwilling to control the recklessness of seminar discussion, which by the end of the semester had devolved into nothing more than a famine of knowledge.",
    "If you'd like to learn, this is not the course for you. This course was an opportunity to digest the news and discuss things that are happening. It helps thinking, but it is not instructional, so to speak.",
    "Taking a class with Charles Blow was a treat in and of itself. Take that opportunity, if you can! The class itself was okay--our discussions were interesting but I don't feel I improved my writing ability.",
    "Never take this class. It was, hands down, the single worst course I've ever had the misfortune of taking at Yale. Professor Charles Blow was a joke. He was on campus once a week for four hours and held office hours only 3 times. He was rude, smug, and astonishingly unprofessional.

He never even bothered to learn any of our names. His assignments were vague (at best). Each paper was a shot in the dark; we had no guidelines and he appeared to grade based on his whims. He talked over students with liberal leanings and talked down to students who identified as conservatives. He was -- quite literally -- a bully, driven by breathtaking narcissism.",
    "Really interesting topic but the class wasn't as great as I'd hoped. Blow is a really interesting professor to learn from (he has a lot of really interesting insights about the way media works, for example) but quality of discussion is totally dependent on the other students in the class.",
    "Hard to answer such a question considering the temporally-specific nature of the course."
