    "A great way to start writing stories.",
    "If you get into this, probably take it.",
    "No. I would write on your own and take a class where you will be edited and pushed to excel instead.",
    "The workshop environment as led by Crowley is fantastic, both sociable and productive, so it's really criticism-heavy without ever being intimidating or antagonistic. (At least our class was; it probably depends on the people.) It really is a brilliant class for disciplining yourself as a writer and improving your content. You need to be willingto approach it humbly and expect heavy criticism from people who are as good as or better than you are, with the understanding that you're there to help each other. If you can take it with an attitude of driven self-improvement and take sometimes-bitter medicine bravely, you'll be rewarded by an incredible class experience.",
    "Yes!! This class was great!",
    "This is a fairly straightforward writing class with workshops and some directed assignments and a quiz. Crowley is a positive presence, and most of the value of the class is based on what you put into it. You can write basically any kind of fiction. I would absolutely recommend it if you want to spend more time writing and have some solid feedback.",
    "Take it. You write stories. It's fun. You get better at writing."
