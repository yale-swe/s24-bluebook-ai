   "comments": [
    "Lots of good practice and such, but vocab was a bit too tied to the book. Maybe some more useful words for college and city life",
    "Strengths are that daily practice of vocabulary and grammar really help reinforce concepts. Weaknesses are that it assumes students do the required reading the day it is assigned, and if they don't, it can take some time to catch up in class with the exercises. It could be improved by having a quick summary or review of the grammar concepts learned from assigned reading before delving into exercises. As a typical language class, this class also has a lot of busy work, and I found myself spending a lot of time writing the 25-30 weekly forum responses and completing the two Connect homeworks each week. I wonder if all of this work is necessary for learning or if it could be cut down somehow."

    "Yes. Good, solid teaching with a clear purpose and method. Great way to learn a language",
    "I would only recommend this class if you need a language credit or if you are trying to take an intellectually less rigorous semester, as I was. Languages can be learned at anytime, so think about opportunity cost of choosing this class over other non-language classes."
