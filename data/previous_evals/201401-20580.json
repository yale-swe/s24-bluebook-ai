   "comments": [
    "The French program at Yale is amazing. French 120 opens up the opportunity to participate in the Yale Summer Session in Paris to learn French abroad, so the credits transfer over very nicely if you do that. It also uses French in Action, which is a delightful video series that teaches French without being the typical vocabulary list.",
    "There is a lot of work. You meet everyday, and there will probably be homework every night. I would recommend this class if you truly want to learn French.",
    "French 120 04 is a good language course that is worth the credit and a half in what you learn, but feels like only a credit because it smooths well the learning process. I'd recommend it strongly for students who are busy with many other classes.",
    "If you're passionate about the language, you're in for a treat. The course is very challenging and rigorous, but also rewarding - by the end of the year you feel so familiar with language that you are able to listen to French songs, watch movies and read books which is a delight for anyone who's always wanted to read \"The Little Prince\", \"Les Miserables\" or watch a Sophie Marceau movie without English subtitles.",
    "It is very challenging, fast paced, and has tests every Mondays. But, it is very rewarding and manageable, and with the right teacher, extremely enjoyable. I would 100% recommend this class to another student.",
    "Awesome. Take it with Madame Burton, she's amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course. French 120 is definitely more intense than 110- we learned 6 verb tenses this semester alone. That being said, your french will dramatically improve and by the end of the year you will not believe how much you have learned. French in Action is a great way to learn, and I highly recommend taking intro French with Madame Burton if you get the chance- she is an amazing professor and I cannot say enough good things about her!",
    "I would recommend French if they were willing to work real hard but truly wanted to learn French",
    "I didn't end up loving my decision to take french, but I loved Madame Burton."
