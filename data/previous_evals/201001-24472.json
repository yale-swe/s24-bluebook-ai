   "comments": [
    "You look at Faulkner's major works stretched across the curriculum, and you also read other books and critical work that will help either illuminate Faulkner or challenge him. I would recommend the class wholeheartedly because I think everyone should have an understanding of Faulkner's writing. The other books we read were equally enjoyable, and I feel well-versed in his work, now, and I can't wait to revisit it as I movethrough life.",
    "Critical reading of some of William Faulkner's best known works, how they are related, and what they say about the author and the time period he wrote in.",
    "This was the best English class I've taken at Yale. Professor Smith is brilliant and approachable, the syllabus is unbeatable, and since it's a senior seminar, all the other students are on top of their game, which keeps the discussion lively and engaging. This is the best possible way to fulfill the English major senior requirement.",
    "obviously quite a bit of work - faulkner is tough. and prof smith will push you to write a good final paper. but definitely a good course.",
    "This class had great virtues, and it also had great flaws. The virtues: the novels arewell chosen, gorgeous, and fascinating. The contexts chosen (Freud, DuBois, etc.) were very clever, well-handled, and opened up a number of ways of reading.The issues: first, the presentation system needs to be rethought. It takes fifteen minutes per class session (i.e., 20% of all class time), and devotes it to an article that only the presenter and Professor Smith have read. This problem compounds the fact that there's too much reading. Frankly, as much as I hold myself culpable for not doing all the reading, when I am in a class where we very clearly cannot work through all the reading, I lose respect for the syllabus, as it were, and become less inclined to do the reading.Second, the paper structure (for those writing the essay) needs to be rethought. We don't hand in drafts! We don't write pieces in advance! By and large, people started thinking about the papers too late. Plus, it's not clear what the criteria for grading the proposals was, nor what was expected. The class presentations were fun and cool, and should be done again (and maybe in all senior seminars), but there needs to be more writing, earlier, and a longer process.Caleb Smith has a sharp critical mind, an indisputable knowledge of Faulkner, and a kind disposition. On the other hand, too much of the class discussion flows through him; he's too quick to correct student comments in a way that deadens the interplay between students. He's generous with his time and available.",
    "This is a good course. I would not take it unless you are confident that you'll be willing to spend a whole semester reading Faulkner, as some people can get frustrated with him pretty quickly. But if you do like Faulkner, I think you can get a lot out of the course, and Prof. Smith is a good teacher.",
    "Faulkner was a good class because I sat down and read six of Faulkner's novels, along with a number of companion pieces from the period. It filled a gap in my reading of American literature and was a fun addition to my courseload.I didn't enjoy the seminar much, however, and I think at least some of this was Caleb Smith's fault. I felt he either exerted too much or not enough control over the seminar at every point. Too much, when he would try to cram five or six passages into 45 minutes or so and we would give each a superficial treatment. Too little, when he would start class by asking \"So what'd you make of Light in August?\" or allowing certain members of the class to launch into seven-minutes monologues that didn't have much to do with the previous comment.That said, Caleb Smith is a very warm and incredibly brilliant professor. It doesn't come across all the much in the seminar itself, but he is enormously well read in Faulkner criticism and was a huge help in office hours.",
    "the reading is tough and time consuming (obviously) but if you love faulkner, it's great. prof. smith is wonderful. take it!",
    "Solid introduction to Faulkner's work. A good number of texts on the syllabus. Alot of reading. Read different areas of criticism widely and early to avoid flailing through different ways of thinking about the novels. Essay self-directed, open-ended, and fun.",
    "Faulkner's a hard guy to like, but this is probably the only time you'll get so up close and personal with the man. Professor Smith is great and the class was a pleasure and a challenge all at once.",
    "Yes, I very much recommend this course.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to another student, only if you know that Faulkner is something that you're going to like.",
    "Yes, if you like Faulkner or think you like Faulkner and want really to get to know an author.",
    "Definitely- but be prepared to do the work. Also, DO NOT take the course if you haven't already read some Faulkner and know that you like it. Otherwise you are setting yourself up for an extremely difficult semester.",
    "Take this \u0096\u00a0a great study of a great author, with a fantastic teacher."
