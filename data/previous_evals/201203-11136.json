    "I would recommend it to any Political Science graduate student.",
    "Yes, obviously I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in modeling. I believe the title of the course is an appropriate summary.",
    "it is worth taking",
    "Yes, the subject matter is interesting and necessary for our field of study.",
    "Good module for anyone interested in political economy. It is slightly demanding in terms of algebra, but the content is extremely interesting.",
    "Frustrating. I would not recommend this course - instead I would tell them to find a different modeling course that might better prepare them to produce their own models and read the literature in the field.",
    "I would recommend the class as a very good introductory survey of modeling fundamentals, important to understand a lot of research in polisci.",
    "For those without a strong mathematical background, learning in this class is highly dependent on the skill of the TA.",
    "i would definitely recommend it",
    "Political Science 517 01 is an introduction to formal theory that coversbasic micro economic thinking and some models related to political systems. It is a challenging course that is essential for students to understand formal theory in political science.",
    "Challenging but very interesting class. Useful for anyone who can deal with the workload"

   "comments": [
    "It helps me to learn more about political competition and distributive justice, which contributed greatly to my forming ideas about my research and dissertation.",
    "I'm a first year student - I expect it to contribute significantly to my dissertation research, but I can't say at the moment. I have however already used my significantly increased literacy in economic models and political economy models to begin working on a model of my own, which I would not have been able to do without the course.",
    "it helps with my understanding of the weak degree of rigorousness of political science",
    "It did not.",
    "It was an essential course to understand formal modeling in polisci.",
    "The course helped extensively to deepen my knowledge of the discipline. It will probably not contribute very much to the methods that I use personally in my research but will certainly shape my thinking and has vastly improved my ability to engage the literature that uses formal theory.",
    "After taking this class, I doubt that formal modeling is my cup of tea. However, I am glad to be more literate in it."
