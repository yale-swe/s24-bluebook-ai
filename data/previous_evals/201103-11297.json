    "Value of the class: I gleaned some information from Kris's personal experiences, but this class did not teach the information that was promised in the syllabus. The class needs more structure and depth about how to function in a corporate setting, not just surface level information about how a company is organized.",
    "This class is absolutely useless and does not accurately reflect what is presented in the course description or what was discussed on the first day of class. Things like \"what a manager does\" or \"what HR does\" have nothing to do with environmental leadership and the bulk of the course material was presented at a middle-school level. The lecture slides, drawn from some sort of pre-packaged course, are demeaning to our intelligence and only useful for someone that has absolutely no idea what a company or corporation is or does. Everyone sits in class with their laptops open and pokes around on email or facebook and pays little attention to the material being presented, but then again, I can't blame them since nothing presented actually required any thought or attention.That all being said, the instructor couldn't have been kinder, nicer, and seems genuinely interested in helping students navigate the jump between school and the corporate world, and I'm very glad to have met her and to have her as a contact. Now someone just needs to help her develop course material that is actually relevant.",
    "Kris was great and the lectures were engaging. I really enjoyed Shawn's HR lecture. The food served was also fantastic.",
    "This course was a good introduction to the corporate world from an environmental perspective. For a 1-credit professional skills course, the workload was as expected. I did not find it as helpful since it was an overview of corporations (their structure, and issues that typically come up in companies) and I have been in the corporate world for the past five years, and worked with various companies as a consultant. As such, I've seen different companies and how they operate, so it was mostly redundant for me. However, I enjoyed the guest speaker from Honeywell's human resources department, as she had some helpful insight into the application process. I also liked the final project, as we were able to delve into a particular company's environmental initiatives. Kris (the instructor) brings valuable perspectives though, and I'm sure the course is a great overview for people coming from the non-profit world.",

Her partner, who works in Human Resources, provided extremely valuable information regarding jobs in this field, the hiring process, and even some tips for salary negotiation. I enjoyed getting to know some new classmates during the group activity at the end of the course.",

   "comments": [
    "The course could have been structured to be a bit more interactive, although the instructor made sure to provide space for Q&A during each session.",
    "Course material that is actually helpful and teaches me something I didn't know 15 years ago. If you have ever worked - anywhere - don't bother taking this class, as you will already know everything presented.",
    "More specifics on how management applies to environmental careers.",
    "didn't cover enough material, pace was too slow, not challenging, my understanding of the topic was not enhanced through taking the class - too basic, didn't cover leadership",
    "Overall, the content was entirely subjective and the lecturers perspective wasn't all that unique. I regret taking the course.For one of the six lectures, the instructor invited her partner in to speak which I thought was inappropriate.I'd recommend this course be removed.",
    "Environmental Management and Leadership is a bit of an awkward subject to teach...it seems like one of the things you're either naturally good at or not. So, while the class was insightful and interesting, I don't think it could really take someone who's either totally inexperienced with management\/leadership and or bad at it and make them a lot better.",
    "Not much substance to this course.",
    "N\/A",
    "While I really enjoyed the informal and conversational nature of this course, a focus on more tangible learning outcomes and principles could help strengthen the course.",
    "This isn't a improvement to this course per se in that this suggestion could go a few different routes: As the instructor likes to say, this is a course about environmental management with an EHS overlay (ie, draws on EHS for the stories and examples). I wonder if either another course, or this course, could offer an EHS professional skills class, offering some technical expertise that we might not get in other classes at school (incident report writing, auditing, H&S, etc).",
    "Thought this course was excellent.",
    "More structure, maybe more powerpoint presentations"

Since I am interested in this field this course provided great insights for me.",
