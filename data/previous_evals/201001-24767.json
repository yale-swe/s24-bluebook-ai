    "If you're looking for a chill class on a great poet, take it. Don't expect major revelations in the discussion, but it's a good way to solidify whatever theory you may have covered before and apply it to text. Don't take it as a 6th credit - the work can sneak up on you.",
    "This is a really great small lit seminar. Professor Syrimis is very down-to-earth, reasonable about deadlines and has a lot to say about Cavafy.The only thing I would say is read over at least a few of Cavafy's poems online and see if you like them before you commit to the course. You're going to be talking about them all semester. The poetry is pretty simple: straightforward syntax and they all have to do with the same three or four basic themes.And don't worry if you're not that familiar with the classics. Plenty of the poetry is about modern themes, and even for the ancient poetry it's pretty easy to find out enough to analyze it.",
    "Buy the Cavafy book and flip through it and see if it works for you. If you don't like the poetry, don't take the class. The class is very poetry based.",
    "This is an enjoyable seminar and George Syrimis is a very fun professor. Cavafy is wonderful and it's amazing to have to read all of his poems for homework. It's a little unstructured though and class presentations can be very boring.",
    "absolutely--if you like cavafy, are interested poetry more generally, queer theory or matters greek. or any combination of the above. cavafy is an amazing poet. george syrimis is an amazing professor and this class is very well put together. the writing assignments were frequent but not unmanageable by any means. george's feedback was useful and his expectations very reasonable. i learned a lot in this class, about reading poetry, about greece, about myself as a reader etc. i recommend this class very, very highly to any one who suspects they might be interested in it."
