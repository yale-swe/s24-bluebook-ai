    "I learned to think about the complex political, historical, and aesthetic stakes of globalization through a variety of disciplinary lenses. Beyond the content of the course itself, Professor Lee helped me to think across the boundaries of different fields, which is a vital task for addressing a subject as complex and multilayered as globalization.",
    "This course did an excellent job of theorizing globalization and its relationship to contemporary art, surprisingly through a very sophisticated historical approach. I was able to read a number of theorists of interest and to think about how the concepts explored in class relate to my own different areas of research.",
    "critical thinking",
    "I learned the complexities and multilayered definitions of globalization, what those definitions mean in the context of global contemporary art, and developed a solid foundation of texts related to this field in not just the history of art, but also American studies, geography, etc.",
    "I developed a much richer understanding of globalization, the course's central concern, but also related questions of neoliberalism, empire, the art market, and so on.",
    "I learned an immense amount regarding the historical context for contemporary considerations of globalization, and the way these networks relate to artistic production, display contexts, and methods for considering creative practice.",
    "This course was incredibly thought-provoking in many ways. In particular, I appreciated being able to think about the spatial and temporal dimensions of globalization -- when it can be said to begin, what it means for our conception of history\/ies, and how the local and the global interrelate. I also enjoyed the challenge of writing short responses. Writing with a narrow focus and with great attention to detail was a helpful exercise."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I found the course to be exemplary in nearly all respects. The syllabus was extremely well crafted, moving between a series of cohesive multi-week units which effectively synthesized interdisciplinary readings into broader themes. Professor Lee is very adept at fostering productive seminar discussions, and in bringing out a high level of effort from all participants. As a result, the class was continuously engaging from start to finish. The class was very theoretically focused, and I enjoyed this a great deal. However, I sometimes found it difficult to know exactly how to connect works of art to this theory in a way which did not simply subordinate the artworks to the theory as a kind of illustration. This, of course, is a broader problematic for contemporary art historians. Nonetheless, I did wish that more artworks and artists could have been brought in to the discussion in a more structured way.",
    "At times we could have engaged more closely with fine art materials.",
    "A strength of this course was the reading list, as well as course discussions and engagement with art, artists and exhibitions. I enjoyed how the class was structured and it allowed for substantial amount of attention to be given to topics without feeling too brief or too drawn out.",
    "It was an excellent course. The reading list was very strong and every week's discussion was compelling. I appreciated the response papers as an exercise and found the in-class presentation structure useful. My only suggestion would be that more emphasis on visual material and analysis of art could have made some of the material a bit more approachable.",
    "Strengths included an incredibly thoughtful syllabus. Initial readings including Savoy\/Sarr and Lowe set an engaging tone, which was carried throughout the course with meaningful texts every week. Student-led seminars were a highlight, and the amount of reading and writing required for the class felt challenging and appropriate. One suggestion for improvement is perhaps more detailed attention to arguments from particular texts (rather than quotes, as highlighted in handouts). This is to say that with some of the more dense theoretical texts, as much support for comprehension is always appreciated. Additionally, examples and talking together through the ways in which philosophical texts can be most thoughtfully utilized in our work in Art History would help better understand how to \"apply\" some of the more theoretical readings. Overall, the class was the most interesting and engaging of the semester for me. Thank you!",
    "The syllabus for this course is thoughtfully curated. I appreciated the diversity of readings each week, as well as the larger arc they created. I also enjoyed the student-led presentations and discussions, which opened up interesting questions and conversations. However, I did often wish that we could hear more from Professor Lee about why she chose particular readings and what strengths or weaknesses they exhibit. I think that because the readings were so provocative and challenging, I would have liked to understand more about how they applied to Professor Lee's own thinking -- some more insight into methodology, critical thinking, or research interests."

   "comments": [
    "I would very much recommend this course to other students. Although the students in this class came from a variety of particular interests within art history, and not all are specialists in contemporary art, nonetheless all remained highly engaged and (from my perspective at least) seemed to get a very great deal out of the course. This is a testament to Professor Lee's ability to think past disciplinary divisions, and help others do the same.",
    "Definitely. I especially liked the reading responses and getting regular feedback from the instructor.",
    "Yes. Good intellectual framework for thinking through our moment of globalized neoliberalism",
    "Yes, professor Lee challenges you in the best ways through assignments, reading and course material. The topic of the course is relevant to a variety of fields.",
    "Absolutely. This was one of my favorite seminars I have taken. Discussions and readings were consistently interesting and made me think in new ways every week. I will not forget what I learned in this course, and it will continue to inform my work.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Yes. This course is eye-opening (and perhaps necessary) even for students who do not study global or contemporary art. It challenges us to think about what we do as art historians and asserts the importance of culture in politics."
