   "comments": [
    "This is a great class I would highly recommend it. The class is on the analysis of the music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven and composition in their style. It is very exciting and still very relevant for contemporary musical pursuits.",
    "The best music theory class ever. You will learn A LOT from Prof. Friedmann. Every class is enjoyable, the materials are interesting, and the workload is very reasonable. By the end of the course, you will choose to compose either the exposition or the first movement of a classical sonata.",
    "It's a great class, Professor Friedmann is very entertaining, and he will help your writing in this style to a great extent.",
    "If you like Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn piano pieces and small chamber ensemble works, then this is the class for you. Professor Friedmann is incredible, and he elucidates elements of the music in a way that's much more \"musical\" than roman numeral analysis. It's a lot of work, but your classical model composition skills will improve monumentally. Take this course, or at least take a course with Professor Friedmann before you graduate. His 20th century music theory class was also awesome!",
    "What an amazing class! Professor Friedmann lives and breathes Classical-era music, and it shows - his expertise is absolutely unmatched. He knows everything. In this class, you'll study six to eight examples of Classical music in incredible depth, spend the first half of the semester doing small compositional exercises, and the rest writing a full Sonata movement. Friedmann will give you detailed comments all semester long and is more than willing to meet with you one-on-one to help you with your composition. It's a lot of work, but the experience is so rewarding. Whether you're a music major or not, if you have the background in music theory, please take it!",
    "No one is better than Friedmann for this particular subject. He knows his stuff inside and out. Even if you're not a big fan of Haydn\/Beethoven\/Mozart, he'll make it interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in having to deal with the classical style very intensely over the semester, ready to invest time and effort on a regular basis. The more a person is already acquainted with the style, the more I would reccomend this course.",
    "You'll learn classical style in depth. Take the class.",
    "This class is really as good as it gets. Extremely highly recommended.",
    "Take this, but be prepared to do lots of work. Friedmann will work you very hard, but you will learn. Shed your preconceptions that it's 'just' Mozart or Beethoven, you will learn so much more."
