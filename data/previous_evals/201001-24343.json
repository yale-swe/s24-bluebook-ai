   "comments": [
    "yes!",
    "Yes, although philosophy is by no means an easy read if you are not interested in it.",
    "DS is great, but only take the class if you;re okay with abstract sections that will get into anything besides the actual text you were assigned. That didn't work for me, and I didn't enjoy the section as a result.",
    "Presumably, if you're looking at this evaluation, you've already done one semester of DS and are thinking about one or both of the following: whether to stick with it, and what to expect from your professors. To the first question: Do it, you know you won't regret it. And, in Philosophy at least, the spring semester is much easier than the fall. And to the second question: Professor Gilmore is brilliant, the consequence of which is that you will understand these philosophers in direct proportion to the amount of attention you pay in section. Unfortunately (in the opinion of some, at least), section is much more like a lecture than a discussion circle, and it's sometimes hard to stay engaged, particularly because the professor isn't great at making himself personally accessible to students. Nonetheless, I was more than happy with the section. Professor Gilmore's lectures were usually clearer than the weekly ones, and they were certainly far funnier.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it to another student because it really will affect the way one sees the world. The texts we address in this class essentially ask what we can know and how we can know it.",
    "While many of the concepts discussed in philosophy are bizarre and fairly inapplicable to anything else (like Leibniz's monads), many of the questions tackled ask you to think in interesting ways about the way we approach knowledge and our moral obligations and relationships. While I don't think I'll take another philosophy course, I'd recommend this one. Directed Studies in general has great professors, small sections, and can really bring out the best in its students.",
    "It is a quick run through of philosophical thought from Descartes to Goodman. My advice would be to give extra time to studying Kant. He is very difficult to understand, and whatever time you can devote would be helpful. While you read, I would write out the main points or arguments the philosopher is trying to convey.The ideas discussed in this course are very important for everyone to understand, at least just the basics. They come in handy in every aspect of my life.",
    "Yes, this is absolutely essential to understanding our notions of ethics and morality and it also is a healthy dose of humility for those who are too certain that they have the right answers to things or that common sense is necessarilly the best approach to difficult questions.",
    "Maybe, it was certainly not my favorite class, and I didn't enjoy the reading."
