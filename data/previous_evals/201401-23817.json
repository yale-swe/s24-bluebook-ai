The organization of the course generated a lot of interesting discussion.",

   "comments": [
    "There were several weeks when there was a substantial amount of reading. It's hard to classify how much is too much, because play scripts are formatted with such variation, but anytime it got to or around the 250 page range, it was a lot to accomplish in a week and there were times when we gave a quick treatment to some of the assigned reading. That being said, the exposure to so much work far outweighed the inconvenience of reading so much, especially because the reading was so well \"curated.\"",
    "*Sometimes plays were short, which actually allowed for reading three to four of them before class. Other times plays were all lengthy, and so getting them all read before class was at times difficult, especially during other YSD\/Rep responsibilities. *Maybe the class needs to reassess the reading load on some days of the syllabus? It's not a matter of complaining that something is too much. It's more a matter of the kind of discussion that one wants to have in class. With less material to cover, more people will be inclined to actually dig into a discussion, especially since they will have been able to balance the reading for the class with their other YSD expectations. *On the other hand, Marc was excellent at not being precious about cramming things into the day's class. If we got to it, we got to it. Otherwise, it had to be let go, which is a very zen attitude to have, and actually helps keep the whole syllabus on track."

We had stage managers, playwrights, American Studies graduate students, and Divinity graduate students at our table, and our discussions were definitely enriched by the outside department experiences these students brought to the class. *Contemporary Am\/Brit theater affects us all in the present, and it is always valuable to know what the current state of drama\/theater\/performance is, especially when one is going into that field as part of one's professional practice.",
