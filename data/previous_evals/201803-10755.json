    "Knowledge not only on vocab and grammar and idioms, but also on Chinese culture and important topics in politics, and the media.",
    "Additional language skills across all fronts.",
    "I saw huge improvements in my grammar and vocabulary. I also learned about Chinese culture and history.",
    "I built upon my Chinese speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills",
    "I developed a much more thorough understanding of the modern Chinese language, as well as engaging with new historical and cultural information. This course gives you experience in discerning formal and informal language, and helps you learn the differences between similar words. I found this focus on word discrimination particularly informative.",
    "Formal Chinese skills, greater knowledge of contemporary Chinese culture, confidence in formal speaking and in giving presentations, skills in writing detailed essays, and character writing\/memorization.",
    "Zhou Laoshi is such an incredible professor. Must take this class!",
    "Chinese language skills, ability to develop professional vocabulary talking about political issues such as marriage and immigrants Chinese essay writing skills, speaking, and listening",
    "I feel that my Chinese improved in all areas of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, while taking this course. I also appreciated how the lesson content also helped us to learn about Chinese history, culture, and contemporary society.",
    "I learned how to give good presentations and think on my feet"

   "comments": [
    "Overall great course.",
    "No weaknesses to be spoken of. Zhou Laoshi's teaching method is very engaging, and he obviously cares a great deal about his students and their progress. His handouts are very helpful as well.",
    "This course was amazing! I love the focus on speaking and grammar as opposed to rote character memorization. We had lots of interesting discussions in class and out of class assignments that tied what we learned to the real world.",
    "I think the class was great overall, my only criticism was that there was a bit too much stress on formal Chinese. Nobody at this level is near fluent, I think it would be a better use of time to learn how to say certain new terms than to learn how to say terms I already know in a different way.",
    "The strengths of this course included the focus on developing different skill sets: not just writing, but reading, speaking, listening, and cultural knowledge. I also thought this class was strong because we did not focus on character writing, so I was able to spend much more of my study time learning grammar structures and vocabulary. One element that could be improved is maybe more evenly distributing work throughout the semester so that there isn't so much to do during test times. Other than that, I thought it was a very well-designed course.",
    "Zhou Laoshi really cares about his students succeeding and truly loves to teach.",
    "Most of it were strengths--well organized and well taught. The only downside was that the sections got too big and there was little time to drill or practice the things learned.",
    "This course has interesting assignments that are enjoyable to complete. I also think that doing the Quizlet many times was a great way to continue reviewing past vocabulary. I think because of that, I am more likely to retain what I learned in this class.",
    "Strength is the homework that reinforces what we have learned in class and the quizlets. It could be improved by more"
