   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to use R at a much more in depth level. I also learned how to approach data cleaning in various circumstances.",
    "This course was instrumental in the furtherance of a number of important skills from a data science and statistics perspective. First, I boosted my working knowledge and experience with the R programming language; the applied nature of the course allowed me to take my existing skills to the next level. This was the first course I took where I learned about how to deal with the imperfect quality of data one encounters in the real world. I was also able to hone the skill of applying judgment to the choosing of an appropriate statistical technique for a given research question. Working with my peers from various disciplines was very enjoyable and rewarding, paralleling the process of collaborating with coworkers in industry or academia. I also gained greater insight into the following topics: simulating power and type I error, data visualization, linear regression, logistic regression, permutation tests, and other statistical techniques.",
    "Much stronger knowledge of R and tidyverse libraries. Practical modelling experience.",
    "I developed my ability to code in R, especially in data cleaning and learning how to manipulate data in order to be able to conduct meaningful analysis on the data. I also learned how to make use of various R packages. I learned about Permutation tests and how to simulate data for the first time.",
    "I learned a lot about using R and how to do statistical analysis on a variety of different data sets. I learned a lot about data cleaning and what constitutes a good data set. Furthermore, working in a team developed presenting skills and how to effectively analyse in a team.",
    "Cleaning data, permutation tests",
    "1. Data scraping 2. The importance of exploratory data analysis 3. Handbag of cool tools like examples of GLMs including Poisson regression + mixed effect models 4. A real appreciate for cleaning data.",
    "Know to approach data analysis in a structured fashion.",
    "data analysis",
    "how to do real statistics case analysis",
    "Data analysis tools and approach.",
    "I gained knowledge and developed skills of data analysis.",
    "Using R to analyze real large data sets"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is a great way to put statistical and data science techniques into practice, while getting more comfortable with the R programming language.",
    "Strengths: 1. Really brought together many important topics in statistics and data science in a useful way. 2. The ample amount of group work with other graduate students from various disciplines gave me exposure to different modes of thinking and attacking a problem. 3. The instructor was very knowledgeable, prepared, and helpful. Weaknesses: 1. Given my interests in statistics, I can discern no immediate weaknesses.",
    "The group work aspect was strength and weakness.",
    "Strengths: Initially there was a lot of guidance on how to handle the case study, which was extremely helpful and easy to learn from. The transition from guidance to more independent work was not as gradual as I would have like, and believe I would have been able to learn more if we had spent more time on learning more tools for how to manipulate data and analyze it.",
    "It is fantastic at getting a grip on large and messy data sets. Could be better in working with more in depth studies on data sets. The first data set was fantastic and was very good to work on. The later ones were less in depth and I learned a bit less from them. It would also be better if model assumptions and what times to use them would be best and why.",
    "We got to play with lots of different data sets but i wished we learned more methods on how to deal with them, rather than using the same way over and over again.",
    "I found it open-ended, which it's supposed to be, but I didn't like.",
    "More formalized presentations on the part of the students, I think, would be valuable.",
    "A bit more feedback, although that's obviously hard with such a large class.",
    "maybe more instructions before homework",
    "The collaborative atmosphere allows students to exchange idea and get inspiration from others' analysis."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, as long as they are willing to put in the necessary effort and are comfortable working in groups and in the R language.",
    "For anyone interested in how statistics and data can be used to provide insight into questions of interest and\/or social significance, I highly recommend this course. I really enjoyed the group work, and the instructor was excellent. The experience working with imperfect data sets was critical in my development.",
    "Yes - if you want hands on experience that is relevant to the real world then take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because even though we were working with toy data sets, I found what I learned from each case study would be practical in other settings. I also found the course material to be fun in general.",
    "Yes, it was a fantastic way to develop data cleaning techniques and how to analyse and think about new data sets.",
    "Yes, since it's fun, applied, and useful in life.",
    "I'd recommend it to stat phd students looking for a semester of practice for their practical qual, specifically after taking another data analysis course in which they could learn skills to apply in this context. I didn't enjoy my experience throwing myself into it headfirst.",
    "Yes! It shows you a glimpse of what it is like to work with real data",
    "Yes, if they are interested in a broad approach to applied data analysis. No, if they are interested in very specific topics.",
    "Of course! this course is excellent!",
    "Yes, because it is good training in data analysis.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. This course is quite applied and very good if the student wants to practice data analysis skills."
