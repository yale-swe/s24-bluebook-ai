   "comments": [
    "Take it only if you are a Mech E major. Otherwise no point. Heat transfer honestly isn't that difficult to pick up on your own. Only applicable if you want to go into grad work or industry related to heat transfer.",
    "you have to take it but its really not that bad. at the end with the final project and final exam it was a lot and he expected a lot for the project without giving us much to work with. but kailas is a good teacher i think and i understood the basics of heat transfer well by the end. getting up at 9 for a boring class on a friday is rough. beware",
    "I love Thermal Energy science. I think it's very intuitive and pretty cool. Just know that you need to reach out to the professor if you want questions about the material or class assignments answered. Section is once a week and it's mandatory, but it's helpful. Overall I did enjoy the class. Very manageable in the spectrum of MechE classes.",
    "not too sure why you're reading this if youre not ABET -- that said, this will be a make or break class for the major (slightly below the level of fluids lab esp. if you have sandro and 489 depending on prof). the homeworks take a while, and the material in general is rigorously covered. the prof is well-intentioned and very nice, just get used to his unusual personal attention (phone calls, one on one meetings very often). he grades nice as long as you draw your figures and show your fundamental first order equations first. midterms arent bad then the final is just...yo wut...? final project takes a while (matlab stirling engine simulation) so get started early. good luck! (and try not to take it senior year...i made this mistake and it was terrible)",
    "Kailas is a really nice guy, but he is so hard to understand in lecture. He speaks softly and doesn't erase the board, and if you ask him for help, he constantly asks you questions instead of telling you answers. That said, he does care a lot about the students and is extremely accommodating. I recommend reading the textbook, it is much clearer than he is.",
    "I would only take this class if it was required. You learn a lot about heat transfer, but it is a fair amount of work and not very exciting.",
    "This class is a pretty standard engineering course. There are weekly problem sets, two midterms, a final project, and a final exam. Section was led by Professor Purushothaman and typically involved having students work out the problems together. Overall, it was a challenging course, but it was well taught and covered almost all of the material of the textbook.",
    "Heat Transfer is a reasonable course compared to the other courses that you need to take for the ABET Mechanical engineering degree. The only annoying part is the mandatory section that meets on Wednesday evenings - it is helpful as Professor K goes over the problem set for the week but it is still a bit annoying. Professor K is very helpful so make sure to see him if you ever need help. Make sure you get a head start on the final project."
