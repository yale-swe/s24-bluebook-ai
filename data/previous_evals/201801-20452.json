    "I learned about the various cell types in the various systems of the body. This class was mainly looking at human cells which was new to me.",

    "Overview of histology and cellular structure\/function of tissues and systems",
    "Good survey of interesting topics in biology and how cellular structure relates to function at a larger level.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I enjoyed that each lecture was taught by a different member of the faculty who was an expert in the field. Weakness: I think the professor really wanted it to be a histology course and it was in no way equipped to do that. There was a \"lab\" component that we never did.",
    "Strong to have lectures about the tissues from those who research them, but more communication to lecturers about topics previously covered so they overlap less. More on how the cells in the tissues interact and lend to function of the system and less of the general this is what ___ organ does. Additionally, having a syllabus hammered out before starting the course would be better. A lab practical was added in. Also there was little time for the CC section to also have a chance to look at the histological sections and ask questions about them, which i think would strongly add to the course. The lectures when these images were gone over were more beneficial and reenforced topics and the slides as well.",
    "Strengths: TA is very responsible and engage in the course. Clinical correlation section allows students to collaborate with each other and have the chance to present. Different lectures are led by different PIs who are experts in the field. They not only covered basic concepts, but also covered research advances.",
    "Strengths: Engaging lecturers and enjoyable classes. Particularly appreciated the effort to have a diverse range of lecturers. Good amount of discussion in class and between students. Weaknesses: Quicker feedback on homeworks would have helped students improve their writing for later homeworks.",
    "I liked the style of the course in that it had multiple different lecturers who were experts in their specific topic, and I appreciated the homeworks, as they tested our knowledge as well as made sure we could learn things.",
    "I liked the weekly homework assignments; I think they were a good way to review the material each week. I think that the histology part of the course can be improved, especially since the lab portion was always filled with the clinical correlations. I liked the online lab tutorials though, but some more time in class to ask questions about the slides would have been better. I think it would have been good to also have some suggested readings posted by each of the instructors.",
    "One strength is that the course doesn't belabor unnecessary details and tests comprehension. The lab\/practical portion of the class needs to be developed and more fleshed out."

    "Yes, it was a very interesting course and Agnes is a great teacher. She always asks very insightful questions.",
    "Yes if they are interested in larger scale research (ie tissue systems, organs, whole mouse research, etc) it would be a very beneficial course.",
    "Yes, I will. The course is well-organized and interesting.",
    "Yes! Enjoyable course.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and the survey of the many topics. I think the histology was a good supplement to each lecture.",
    "I would recommend the course, its a great way for basic scientists to be introduced to physiological systems."
