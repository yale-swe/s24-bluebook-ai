   "comments": [
    "The word that best describes the topics covered in this course is \"elegant.\" Every day Frame produces another elegant model, revealing the structure and complexity inherent in the natural world. There's a particular aesthetic pleasure to be found in the study of patterns and models; simplicity, reiterated, describes complexity, from the curl of a fern to the space-time continuum.Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote an excellent sonnet about Eudlid (incidentally, the highly structured sonnet form suggests to me the aesthetic beauty of geometry, and vice versa). Bertrand Russell--philosopher, logician, and mathematician) called mathematics \"the queen of the sciences.\" This course studies math because it's interesting, and beautiful,and rewarding, not because it's required.If you're still reading this, you probably ought to take this class. The workload is reasonable, Frame is a wonderful professor, and I really enjoyed my biweekly math appreciation sessions. Do expect to use some calculus, and pay attention in class. Many of the homework sets require a little ingenuity as well as good notes.Also, Frame tells jokes. Often they are funny.",
    "I would summarize Math 170 as an exploration of the mathematics behind a number of natural phenomena such as fractals, topography, and curvature. I would recommend the class to a student who is curious about the subject, even if they don't feel confident in their math. A few topics are difficult and involve calculus, but Professor Frame is always willing to stop and answer questions very thoroughly.",
    "A great QR credit for people who like math and science but are humanities minded - really interesting applications of math, not too much work (both midterm and final are open note), and a wonderful professor non-math\/science majors would never otherwise run into. Professor Frame is always available to answer questions and stops class for joke breaks. Make sure to start the homework before the night before it's due so you can go to office hours, you'll do a lot better.",
    "Not exactly an easy course, but a nice QR with actually interesting material. Weekly problem sets were time consuming, but could be done in one night. Professor Frame's lectures were usually pretty engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a friend who was interested in learning about cool mathematical phenomena without going too deeply into any one confusing area. This course was a great way to be introduced to new mathematical ideas (and offer something different in my course load and homework, working a different side of my brain than what I use in all my humanities courses).",
    "If you need a QR, if you like good professors, if you are a human being, you will like this class.",
    "Professor Frame is great. The material is great and fun. If you like math\/physics kinda stuff, and you want to keep liking it (not hating it because its badly explained or too difficult) TAKE THIS CLASS! I loved it, and was sorry to take the final because it was over.",
    "Very good course - not too difficult, but mostly interesting; if you're a humanities person or someone looking for a 5th class to fulfill some distribution requirements, this is likely just what you're looking for. Frame is great, and the topics, though varying from very interesting to mildly so, will give you a new perspective on math."
