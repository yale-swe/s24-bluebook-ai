   "comments": [
    "I would say the Historical Jesus is an incredibly in-depth look at what we can determine about the life of Jesus of Nazareth from our limited sources. It's also an introduction to methods of historical criticism and analysis that are widely applicable, and you will definitely be a better writer by the end of the course.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction in uncovering who Jesus may have actually been. In addition, Professor Martin is an elite instructor who is extremely personable. The papers are doable and the prompts made them more interesting. This past semester my classmates and I reviewed how some films and books portrayed Jesus. If you're at all interested in studying the New Testament, strongly consider taking this class.",
    "You learn about contemporary historical methods and theories about the historical Jesus. It's fascinating, but gets a bit monotonous if you don't have a huge tolerance for Jesus. The final essay was a lot of fun - you get to pick your topic. I gained a lot from this class, and I would recommend it,.",
    "Definitely the class that other people asked me the most about - you get intimately familiar with the Gospels and learn to parse through them to determine what may be historical in the life of Jesus and what is not. You definitely learn that nothing is concrete in history and you learn historians' methods of determining relative historicity, but if you are looking for a definitive \"This is Jesus\" answer you'll likely be disappointed. Dale is a fun and likable professor who loves to work closely with students, though he does seem entrenched in his own interpretation and unwilling to see outside of it. I would definitely recommend this class to religious studies majorsand non-majors alike, as it is just interesting and eye-opening and definitely an important topic in history.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The work load was such that we were able to read and really think about the material. We were given ample opportunities to become deep learners regarding the subject matter."
