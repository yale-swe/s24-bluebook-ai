    "I wouldn't take it over other CS electives. Had it not been a SC credit I wouldn't have taken it.",
    "One of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. Lectures were rambling (Zucker is nice person though), but wow, what a waste of a credit. Exams are ok, but you better study for them. The math is a lot heavier than advertised, and you'll never get your problem sets back until the day before the final (so you get no feedback, and you don't know what are the right answers until late). Do yourself a favor and skip.",
    "Interesting material, but be prepared to spend most of your effort figuring out what the assignments and tests want from you. This class throws a lot of high level abstract information at you, but on the plus side only expects you to really implement some of the more basic concepts yourself. On the minus side, it's literally never made clear which of the concepts you do need to know, or how they connect, build on each other, &tc. But yeah, it is interesting, and it does all kind of come together towards the end. This is Zucker's main area of study, so his enthusiasm does a fair bit to make up for (and\/or exacerbate) the haphazardness of the course.",
    "Take it if you want a good CS credit without all that much work. My advice is find a friend or two and do the homeworks together and study the lecture notes before the tests.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class unless you have a very serious interest in the topic and would be willing to overlook some of the disorganization and not so great teaching. The topics are all very interesting, but I definitely had a hard time following the lectures.",
    "Don't take this in its current form. Material is fascinating but needs a lot of math background, which is taught terribly by Prof Zucker. Maybe worth a shot if someone else teaches it. Psets are interesting but kind of cryptic - takes a while to figure out what youre supposed to answer (kind of like ECON 121, if you've taken it)"
