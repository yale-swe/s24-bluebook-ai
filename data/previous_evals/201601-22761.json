    "MATH 501 is a great class. I highly recommend it to fellow students.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand complex semisimple Lie algebras.",
    "It's a good class but it requires initiative on your part if you want to learn the material. Prof. Qi is very helpful (perhaps overly helpful given the long line of linear algebra students outside of his office), so you can always ask him question. You Qi has the notes for the class available on his website, so you can see what material is covered for yourself."

   "comments": [
    "It is very helpful to my research.",
    "This course lays much of the foundational material of the domain of discourse for my dissertation. I found it helpful to revisit these fundamentals from the point of view of Dr Qi.",
    "Before this course, I had taken intro to representation theory but the material did not click. Now it does. I still think representation theory is magical (not a physicist at all, so I have zero intuition) but at least I can see how it is a coherent structure. I also found the interplay between rep theory and combinatorics, which prof. Qi often emphasized, rather enticing."
