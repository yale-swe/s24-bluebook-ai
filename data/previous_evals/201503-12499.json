   "comments": [
    "No better way to pick up Spanish. Take it if you want to learn the basics of this language.",
    "A thorough and challenging way to learn Spanish and interact with its cultural aspects.",
    "This is a class only intended for those who plan to study aside from the assigned homework tasks. The intensive nature of this course rushes through a lot of different grammatical\/linguistic concepts in a short amount of time, so keeping up through independent study and review is crucial (an idea I learned a bit too late.) Definitely doable, just plan on studying grammar\/vocab for a little while each day.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. Normal language classes I've taken at Yale I feel didn't immerse me as much as I would have liked, because I only spent a short time of the day speaking in class. But two hours every morning is great. Because it's worth two credits you can really focus on the subject material and not take as many other classes.",
    "I highly recommend Span 125 especially if you have a light semester. There is a good amount of daily homework and weekly assessments, but the time put in will pay off at the end. I looked forward to going to class every morning. 100 minutes of class every day flew by especially because of Professor Lourdes. She is not only funny and engaging but also an amazing teacher!",
    "SPAN 125 01 is Spanish for the dedicated student. This is a student who wants to learn about Spanish and gain a lot of skills (and quickly). It does help if you know English grammatical concepts well, so it is then easier to apply to Spanish, but even if you don't know, the professor was great at teaching complex topics. I highly recommend the course if you want to challenge yourself and see results quickly. You also really get to bond with your class since you see them so often.",
    "This was an EXCELLENT course, absolutely one of my favourites that I have ever taken at Yale. I learned a ton of Spanish, and the hour and fifty minutes per day was actually so much more bearable than I thought it would be. But the real reason this class is so amazing is undoubtedly because of Professor Sab. She keeps class entertaining and interesting, there is a great emphasis on speaking through many role-playing exercises, and a varied reading list. There is definitely a lot of work, but honestly it's not unreasonable at all, especially if you know another romance language. Even studying for the tests isn't a huge drag because you've spent so much time in class learning the material, so it's not like you ever have to scramble to do all the reading you'd left until the end, or whatever. DEFINITELY take this class if you want to learn a lot of Spanish is a fun and satisfying way -- can't imagine the slow pace of L1 after how much I learned in this class.",
    "There is plenty of work. You will spend 1-2 hours every day doing Spanish homework outside of the classroom. Yet, SPAN 125 01 is one of the most rewarding classes that you can take. You will experience tangible improvements in your language abilities very quickly if you are willing to put in the effort. If you are truly interested in learning Spanish, I highly recommend this course."
