    "I gained some familiarity with equipment available for iphone documentary shooting but thats pretty much it.",
    "Ability to more critically analyze story.",
    "It helped me gain the confidence to continue pursuing film.",
    "I learned so much from this class. I learned how to operate audio technology and Adobe software. This class allowed me to explore my academic and journalism interests in a creative way. Sandra expected us to be creative but also disciplined.",
    "I have to preface I had some experience with doc filmmaking before the course. In short I didnt learn anything. I thought I would learn to use sound equipment at least since I had access to it now but Sandra never bothered to teach us except for a 10min lesson one day and then refused to answer questions about equipment at any point after the second class. Her answer was always read the manual, but I always though it would be more helpful if she taught us, since thats part of her job description. As for storytelling elements, she was also not able to help. Sandra is very poor at articulating her expectations, her thoughts and criticisms. She would spend 3 hrs critiquing, going off topic, and telling stories in response to 2 students projects. Then she would rush through the next 8 in an hour, often missing students. As I write this I feel she would answer that filmmaking is about learning on the go and on your own, but thats not what Sandra fostered. She is supposed to guide us and answer questions, Im not asking for her to be with us every step of the way. Instead, we would go out on our own, film stuff, inevitably mess up and she would critique the final product. Often times we would be asking ourselves what to do in the class group chat, teaching ourselves. The class also had very pointless assignments. Her answer is that assignments have value that we cannot see, but as I said before I have some experience and that did not feel the case, and this is more subjective. But documentary work is. I didnt not feel like I was learning anything, I never felt Sandra was a teacher, more like someone we had to listen to for 4:30hrs every Monday give us thoughts\/random comments\/criticism\/some times inappropriate opinions about our work.",
    "I learned the basics of documentary filmmaking: how to film and edit video as well as tell a story from the footage",
    "I learned how to work with deadlines and how to work with other people in regards to filmmaking. I also learned, by trial and error mostly, how to use PremierePro."

   "comments": [
    "Where to even begin. Strengths are that this class tends to draw really interesting artists that are a good community of makers. Weaknesses, however, are everything else. -There is no functioning equipment borrowing system. It is very chaotic and definitely hindered our work, especially on the final project. -The first day is legitimately traumatic. Its basically a round table hunger games of you begging to get in and her monologuing about how good this class is (HA! Little did we know.) -She does not give any grades until the end of the term, even though we have multiple assignments each week. When we questioned about this, she said she prefers to grade holistically so basically all our grades are based on her overall impression of us instead of actually being graded I guess?? -Prof. Luckow is a really, really difficult professor. She is very harsh and does not really provide constructive feedback, which makes growing in this class and with your work difficult. She also does not teach anything about editing and virtually nothing about how the equipment works and expects you to 100% teach yourself from online guides and manuals during your free time. -She crosses a lot of professional boundaries and makes the class a very uncomfortable space. There will be whole class days where it feels like you dont learn anything but gossip from Prof. Luckows professional life. -She continually gives conflicting and contradictory information, and reacts to questions\/confusion as if you are personally attacking her value as a human being. In our class, kids would literally get 45 minute lectures in front of everyone about a mistake they made or a question they had.",
    "It does a disservice to inexperienced students' projects because the basic technical instruction was lacking.",
    "Strengths: being required to make something every week really forced me to push myself in putting in the work to getting better. weakness: wish we had started planning\/thinking about our final projects earlier in the semester.",
    "The greatest strength is what the class represents. In a college like yale where the undergrad arts program is so neglected, i applaud the professor for leading this class",
    "Strengths: Sandra was so supportive of my project and my classmates' projects when students were willing to accept her help. She expected a lot: discipline, organization, creativity. So don't take this class if you are unwilling to put in the work. If you are, you will learn so much about creative storytelling and filmmaking. Weaknesses: The four-hour class is really long. I wish I had learned how to operate a camera.",
    "Strengths: meet other people who are invested in documentary filmmaking and want to learn. The professors weaknesses made us unite and help each other out. Weaknesses: the course format. the professor. there are a lot of things I dislike about the course but I will try to be objective and factual although documentary filmmaking is a very personal and emotional experience and that definitely plays into it. First, structure of the course. The course should not be 4.5hrs once a week. I ask any dean, professor to sit through a 4.5hrs anything and stay focused and interested all the way through. The course should be spread out minimum two times a week. Filmmaking is a process and the professor should be with us up until the actual shooting, thats where the teaching is done (this is and INTRO course in case anyone forgot, for people with 0 experience). I believe this is better than looking though the last weeks work, shredding it, then moving on to the next project that was discussed by Sandra in the last 3mins of class. Second, Sandras comments were often off topic and wasted time and at times inappropriate. Class time was spent poorly. Again a fault of a 4.5hr class. Sandras off topic comments were not helpful, it felt more like gossip about her life or other students. A student would ask a question or have a comment and Sandra would take that and fly with it for 30mins. She argues that the comments are helpful, but no one would engage with her because it did not feel pertinent. It was clear she did not have a plan about what we would talk about (not teach, because she didnt) during the 4.5hr class every day, it was more like she was winging it. As for the inappropriate comments, like I mentioned before, documentary filmmaking is very personal regardless of the subject and in our particular case, students chose to make very personal projects as well. I believe the professors job was to provide structural guidance in terms of story (what makes a good story, how it should be structured, what elements are needed) and teach us technical skills (camera settings, sound, equipment use). Although she did not do most of that, honestly at the end of the course it felt like any, she would often overstep those responsibilities and comment on our own lives or the people we made films about. I will just list the ones I remember. Sandra said she pitied and felt sad for the profile about a student. She was upset when another student stated they restarted a project because they didnt want to exploit a friend. She wanted another student to represent her friend as arrogant and elitist when my classmate did not feel comfortable and expressed many times. At the final screening she told a student to fix their sound, because it was horrible, or she would fail him, in front of 40+ people. She had and did not comment on anyone elses project during the screening, it was incredibly inappropriate and embarrassed the respective student. I could list many more but in the end the entire class felt like a blur, it was a constant cycle of dreading going to class to listen to her make pointless comments she made up in the moment.",
    "I learned so much about filmmaking by taking this class. I thought the exercises each week were extremely helpful and I learned a lot from each one; they also nicely prepared me for the final project. In addition, the feedback we received on our work was extremely useful. One way the course could be improved is that for the most part, classes were us watching everyone's work and critiquing them; while this experience was very valuable and I enjoyed watching my classmates' work, sometimes we spent so much time on certain pieces that we wouldn't get to everyone's, which could be frustrating. It might have been more effective if we only critiqued some of the classes' works, ensuring that everyone getting critiqued got adequate feedback, as well as giving us more time to learn some technical skills.",
    "Class time could be a lot shorter and feedback could be more individually tailored. Assignments forced us to go outside and actually do something."

    "Under no circumstances would I recommend this class. Please trust me when I say to you that you would be better served to download the FilmicPro app and spend a couple hours a week filming stuff you like, you will learn so much more and be so much happier. Also you will have to do all this anyway because she expects you to teach yourself, so you might as well not spend 4 hours in class on top of this. Please, future generations, do not make the mistake I made.",
    "No. A class in which students are supposed to be truthfully telling stories necessitates a respectful environment. This is something that I do not think is accomplished in this class.",
    "Yes, if students are determined and committed to studying documentary filmmaking",
    "Please take this course if you are willing to put in the work and set aside your ego to learn from Sandra. Art is difficult because it is so subjective, but Sandra has a lot to teach.",
    "no. only if it was taught by someone else. I feel it be more helpful to teach yourself on YouTube.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who's interested in filmmaking. It's a lot of work, but ultimately, I found it to be very worthwhile.",
    "Eh, only if they're serious about filmmaking but only then as a primer for difficulties, as it's still a far cry from actually working on a set trying to work with actors."
