   "comments": [
    "I think it is an average insight, very broad and very survey.",
    "Apart from learning a great deal about China itself, I thought the way Professor Ho structured the course as quite literally Mao to Now (Mondays focused on Mao and Wednesdays Mao), allowed the class to draw the sharpest and most salient distinctions between the two periods, and helped me make sense of and contextualize many of the current events that involve China today. I liked how the first few weeks outlined the central moments in China's history, then used the following weeks to address the thematic elements we discussed, e.g. education, class, the economy, etc., and how those things have shifted from the Mao era to today.",
    "learned about china",
    "Overview of Chinese history after the communist revolution and how Mao's legacy penetrates into society today. Class is organized by theme and not in chronological order though so can get confusing.",
    "I learned a vast amount about 20th century Chinese history, sociology, economics, and ideology.",
    "I learned the progression of Chinese history from the Mao era to the present, and how various aspects of Chinese society and politics evolved to what we see today. I also learned how to analyze primary sources and to form and assess historical arguments.",
    "I learned a lot about China from Mao to Now, go figure. But the course really did allow me to engage with China's recent history, and put a lot of my thoughts about the world in perspective. I'd highly encourage a student who hasn't been exposed much to East Asian History to take this course, as the knowledge really is very fascinating.",
    "This course teaches you how to read news about China",
    "I learned how to think critically about events in history, approach topics from different lenses and time periods of history, and use primary sources in my research.",
    "I learned a lot about 20th century China, especially cultural history. I also gained experience doing primary source research for my final paper.",
    "This course will challenge you, as it is unlike other history courses at take. Expect ridiculously meticulous IDs.",
    "This course provides a very general understanding of how the Chinese Communist Party rose to power and has continued to dominate the Chinese state from around 1921 onwards. It's a great course for for understanding how modern China works today because it both sets a foundation for historical context as well as analyzes the contemporary state. There is a large focus on primary source analysis, which is good for developing analytical and critical thinking skills (although this can be a little challenging because it's set in a history that one might not be familiar with).",
    "By taking Mao to Now, I learned a tremendous amount about China and its recent history. While my understanding of the country had previously been news-headline deep, the course provided me with a far richer understanding of Chinese politics, culture, economics, and more. Insofar as introductory courses are meant to furnish students with a broad-ranging overview of a country's history and present day dynamics, this course was spectacularly successful. It also whet my appetite to continue exploring and learning about China. By taking this course, I also learned more about history research and essay writing using primary sources. The two essay assignments put a premium on primary source analysis, which was both enjoyable and educational. I also appreciated our visit to learn more about the librarys extensive resources.",
    "Concrete understanding of how the current Chinese political system was formed and how it is maintained Skills in writing historical IDs (identifications), which I had never done for a class before I think I can now speak intelligently about modern Chinese history, the influence of Mao Ze Dong, and apply that knowledge when I hear or talk about current issues in the world related to China",
    "Amazing class- really got a great understanding of 20th century China",
    "I remember the first day of class, Professor Ho said that her goal for the course was for us to be able to read any news on China and be able to understand its significance. I think she succeeded. I have gained a broad understanding of modern Chinese history.",
    "This was my first history course so I learned how to research for historical primary and secondary resources, and how to analyze them. I also learned so much about China from two very different time periods (Mao-Era and contemporary China). I really enjoyed learning about China from this comparative perspective.",
    "This course introduced me to aspects of recent Chinese history that I was unaware of and plan to explore in more detail. Professor Ho's lectures are far-reaching and chock-full of interesting information. She is an inspiring lecturer.",
    "Considering I did not know much about China before this class, I learned a lot about 20th century China and the similarities and changes over time between Maoist China and today's China.",
    "This course not only taught me a lot about modern Chinese history, but it also honed my sense of making cross-period connections and tracking continuity and change over time. Also, my TA Alex and the section helped me develop a better sense of how to closely analyze history and write about it in a precise and fluid way.",
    "I gained a pretty strong insight into modern Chinese history from this course. I went into this course with a pretty sparse understanding of modern Chinese history and Chinese history more generally - my only background was from taking John Gaddis' Cold War and common knowledge. As such, I definitely appreciated learning more about an important country and civilization that is increasingly shaping international affairs. Besides that, I didn't gain much out of the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a great course that covered a lot of fascinating material, and I genuinely enjoyed the readings. Lectures were always enjoyable, if a little rushed at times. Professor Ho is fantastic! That said, I wish the discussion section had been more oriented toward discussing the readings and the touchstone questions. We usually devoted section time to talking about what made a good \"ID\" answer for the exam and rehashing keywordsteaching to the test, essentially. Even so, students in my section still seemed confused about the expectations for a good ID, especially because the midterm scores and comments were so harsh. I was happy with my score, but I (and other students) did think the comments could have better accounted for the time constraints of the exam. I wish we could have talked about the material more organically and in-depth during section.",
    "The lectures were not always paced consistently so many times there seemed like too much information and some times too little for the time allotment. However, most of the readings were pretty interesting and I do think I learned about the roots to contemporary issues in China.",
    "One strength is certainly the structure. Each day Professor Ho had a comprehensive handout of the lecture that allowed us to follow complex narratives easily. I think structuring the course around thematic elements, and not a chronological, linear outline of history, allowed me to understand the direct relationship between policies in the Mao era that concerned, for instance education, under Mao and how that explains the way education in China today is structured. Often I felt the lectures had too much of an interactive component; I personally tend to prefer to just hear the professor and save student comments for section. But, such a note is largely irrelevant and did not serve to detract from how I enjoyed the course.",
    "weakness was it could sometimes be confusing because we alternated between mao and now every lecture so sometimes i couldn't remember chronology",
    "It was in chronological order so hard to follow. Grading was much harder than a typical history class.",
    "The course covers an enormous amount of material. This is a strength and a weakness: a strength because one comes away from the course with vastly more knowledge than one had; a weakness because inevitably some of the information and concepts won't come through clearly when there are so many to deal with. The course would benefit from some streamlining, as well as a more conscious effort to connect its individual elements to overall themes - some of the discussions in the course, while individually interesting, were hard to understand as part of a 'big picture'.",
    "the course is too ambitious, tries to cover WAY too much material in one semester",
    "The course is a great introduction to Chinese modern history, and I think that the structure of the course allows a good grasp of the continuation and development of Chinese history. I also like the thematic approach of the course, which presents a holistic understanding of China. Sometimes the material seems to be a lot and I feel like some issues are not given sufficient time to discuss, but that is understandable given that this course is an introductory course to Chinese modern history.",
    "I think the strength of the course definitely lies in the content and how fundamentally fascinating it isat least to me! I felt that the readings themselves were all very intriguing in their own way and useful, but that at times I did not see why I was reading this for the class, as many readings would go undiscussed in class and maybe be brushed over quickly in section. I also felt that the use of powerpoint was a bit uncertain. Professor Ho largely lectured off the outlines that she gave us, which definitely worked, but at times the existence of the power point in the background was a little distracting. Also the fact that it wasn't in presentation mode was slightly annoying!",
    "This course's thematic progression was pretty challenging at times. I would have really appreciated if we went over all the readings that we did in either section or lecture, to see how they fit into the course. We never spoke once about Chen Village. Grading was incredibly nitpicky and unclear.",
    "The course was incredibly well taught and organized. I learned a lot.",
    "The course covers a lot of information and it's very thorough. Professor Ho and the TAs were extremely dedicated; the TAs especially were always available to meet with students. In my opinion one weakness is the thematic structure of the course. I think teaching it in chronological order as most history lectures are taught would be better than the thematic orientation.",
    "The content was incredibly interesting and engaging. However, there was perhaps too much content for two one hour and fifteen minute lectures. Expect that you won't capture everything in your notes",
    "This course is covered thematically, which I think is a good way to emphasize how the different components Professor Ho thinks are important, but this does make it a little hard to piece these components of the history together. I think it'd be possible for lectures to put more emphasis on how events fit into context with each other (across the themes), so the students have a better chronological understanding of events. Or, in section, spend a little time putting an emphasis on synthesizing dates and putting things in order to better this chronological understanding.",
    "The material was good but the way it was presented in lecture was kind of dry and could be dull.",
    "I think the organization of the course was one of it's strengths, because it allowed closer analysis of certain topics. However, at times it was also confusing because I felt like I got confused between the sequence of events. Also, the reading assigned was sometimes overwhelming, but I think one of the strengths of this course was the opportunity to engage with many primary sources.",
    "Strengths: -I really enjoyed the thematic Mao to Now format of the class. Starting with a crash course in Chinese history followed by thematic sweeps from Mao to Now allowed me to formulate a truly rich and nuanced understanding the country. While its hard to say for certain, I believe this format led to a deeper understanding of China than would have been afforded through a chronological approach. -I thought the readings were well-chosen. They effectively complimented the lectures and provided great fodder for both section discussions and the essays on the exams. -The guest lecture on media was definitely a highlight. Areas for Improvement: -I really enjoyed Chen Village, but would have appreciated the opportunity to more fully engage with the book in both section and lecture. -While the lectures were thorough and packed with excellent material, it was sometimes difficult to take notes at the speed the information was delivered. Accordingly, I would have appreciated a slightly slower pace during lecture. -I wish we had the opportunity to learn more about Chinas role in the world. Perhaps a week on foreign policy from Mao to Now could be added to the course.",
    "I think the first half of the course (focusing more on the background of the Mao era and state and politics) was much stronger than the second half (focusing on cultural issues like media, intellectuals, etc.). Perhaps it's because I knew so little about Chinese history and the Mao era to begin with, but the first half felt like a whirlwind of information and knowledge it was super exciting! And we were reaching super interesting conclusions and developing patterns between historical events. This may also be because I am naturally more interested in politics. However, a few of my other classmates also found that sometimes the second half seemed more like an afterthought, while the first half was truly the \"meat\" of the course. Additionally, the \"crash course\" section at the beginning, where we cover the entire era from Mao to now, was very confusing, even though I read the entire book on Mao history by Rebecca Karl that we were assigned. I wonder how that could be improved for future classes. However, overall I really enjoyed the readings. I think they were well selected, and I enjoyed almost every single lecture.",
    "I thought that the lectures were extremely informative, however a little dry at times. The professor is extremely kind and insightful",
    "I really liked how the class was organized into a different topic each week. I don't know if I have any suggestions. The only suggestion I would make would be to have both of the sections after both of the classes. My section was on Tuesday, which was after we'd covered the first half of the topic and not the second. That made it more difficult to compare Mao and now in section.",
    "Fascinating class; lectures were great. Workload was fine (two papers and two exams) but the reading was ridiculous, so much that I never did any of it as opposed to doing all or some of a smaller amount. Heavy emphasis on primary sources which was interesting but added to the workload. Midterms, particularly the IDs, were graded much more harshly than in any other class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Strengths: the general framing (comparing Mao-era China and post-Mao-era China); the lectures were really well organized and very engaging Weakness: the sections - I think that hour spent in section could have done better to go over the primary sources\/readings, rather than going over the keywords, which are mostly\/ all covered in lecture.",
    "Too much emphasis on memorizing facts, and not enough emphasis on developing arguments.",
    "The grading on the midterm was very unrealistic and harsh. In comparison to the 4 other history lecture courses I have taken at Yale, the expectations for what students could write in a 5-minute ID for this course were too high and not explained clearly before the exam. My TF tried to correct this by going over what the expectations were before the final in an in-depth manner, but considering the grading of other history courses, I think the grading for this course should be adjusted. This course has a reasonable amount of reading, and Professor Ho does a good job of comparing different themes during the two different eras the class covers.",
    "This course was well-organized in first presenting a \"crash course\" of modern Chinese history, but then going through the rest thematically and from the \"Mao to now\" perspective, rather than chronologically. That was really good in creating a clearer and more digestable sense of development in each area, rather than a broad but shallow understanding that a chronological organization would have perhaps resulted in",
    "The main strength of this course was its crash course in the beginning, which managed to provide an incredibly comprehensive overview of Chinese history since 1949. I also liked the thematic course of the approach beyond the initial crash course, where what would one expect to learn about in reference to a modern state - politics, economics, class, education, labor, intellectuals, media, religion, etc. - was systematically covered. Unfortunately though, beyond this, I think the course was fraught with weaknesses. I don't like writing critical course evaluations and hesitate in doing so, but unfortunately I think it is necessary in this case. The biggest weakness of the course were probably the lectures themselves - I found them often rather disorganized and confusing, sometimes too repetitive, sometimes grazing quickly over major issues and then spending time on useless details that students don't have room in their brains to memorize anyway. I also found the amount of time allotted for lecture, and hour and fifteen minutes instead of the usual fifty-minute lecture, was completely unnecessary. I think the necessary information could definitely have been included in fifty minutes. Week-after-week I found myself quite bored in lectures. In addition, I think the syllabus was a key weakness of the course. I realize that understanding the internal dynamics of a state is important, but I was frankly surprised how much China's relations with other states was practically completely eschewed, with the exception of the guest lecture on Japan towards the end of the semester. I am a European History major focusing on diplomatic and military history, and frankly I was shocked that China was treated in a bubble in such a way. I think going forward the course should 100% include more about modern China's relations with other countries, including not just Japan, but also the United States, Russia, and China's East Asian neighbors. How this is structured in terms of lectures is up to Professor Ho, but I think that this is a must and would also attract more interest in the course. Finally, a very important weakness of the course was that it generally simply didn't feel like an intro-level course, which is what it is. As a European History major, Yale makes me take history courses in other regions of the world, and I thought this would be an interesting and important intro course about Asian history that would be relatively straightforward. But that didn't end up being the case. There are at least two major reasons that must be remedied why the course didn't feel like an intro course. The first is the grading. Expecting five major ideas or \"keys\" within an ID for an intro history class is downright preposterous. I've taken a dozen intro history classes, and two or three ideas should be plenty for full credit. The grading overall on essays and the IDs was also simply too hard, there's no other way to say it. The second major reason that the course didn't feel like an intro level course was the constant mentioning of specific authors and scholars in lecture, and what seemed to be an expectation that we would memorize their names and arguments. Intro level history courses should be based on bodies of knowledge, not memorizing the arguments of specific authors - this isn't a seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe not. As always, personal interest level in the content is most important but the class itself was not incredible.",
    "Certainly. Beyond learning how to write more effectively (I credit this in large part to my TF), I think the course teaches Yale students how to make sharp and salient distinctions, a skill I think translates to any academic field. Even more, the information in this course is relevant today, and I think serves any student a tremendous service in being an informed citizen about pertinent international issues.",
    "it was a fine course, didn't love it didn't hate it",
    "I might. The lectures were good, the readings were engaging, but the sections were poorly run.",
    "Not really an easy course at all. This class has 2 papers, one shorter 4-6 page paper and one longer 6-8 page paper, AND a midterm and a final. Most reasonable classes either have two papers and one exam, or two exams and one paper. Professor Ho is nice and very knowledgeable but tries to cover too much material and the TFs are hit and miss. The papers and tests are graded quite strictly - my TF said that when they read papers and test responses they are explicitly looking for any reason to take points off so it is very difficult to get full scores on these assignments. Okay Cr\/D class, not recommended otherwise.",
    "Take this course! It is a great introduction to Chinese modern history, and the course offers a holistic understanding of how China developed from the Mao era to what it is today. Professor Ho is amazing and provides sufficient guidance for students; the two essay assignments were all provided with a list of suggested sources, and a librarian info session was also provided. The workload is not the lightest, but you will learn a lot in the end!",
    "Yes! Take this course if you are at all interested in Chinese history. The content itself is engaging enough and it's a history that most Yale students do not know enough about. The course definitely isn't a cake walk, and whether or not there is a curveyou may want to ask the professor if there was oneit could even be harsh as the midterm average was especially low. Professor Ho's lectures aren't the most engaging, and tend to be content heavy especially in the 75 minute lecture, but I still found the course favorable.",
    "This course is a mixed bag - the lectures are great and the readings are usually pretty interesting if you have a preexisting interest and understanding of China, but the majority of readings were never discussed (including an entire book, Chen Village), and grading felt very arbitrary. I would recommend this course to students with a background in China already who are looking to dive more deeply into early communist history.",
    "I would recommend to another student because it is more than just a survey course of Chinese history, it is a history that compares thematic elements.",
    "Decent course on 20th century Chinese history. The syllabus is organized thematically, not chronologically, which I felt was unhelpful. Also definitely not as easy as some other history lectures like Eastern Europe. The reading isn't too intense but TAs graded midterm pretty harshly. Also the midterm and final test concepts in the lectures that often don't show up in the readings, so it's definitely more important to take good lecture notes than to do all the readings. This class will probably improve as Professor Ho teaches it more, but for now I would say unless you have a really strong interest in the topic it isn't the best history lecture out there.",
    "I think this course, despite some of the difficulties brought on with a thematic analysis as opposed chronological, it's a good survey course on modern Chinese history. Any student that wants to grasp what Mao and post-Mao leadership have brought to China should take this course.",
    "Only if they were highly interested by the material.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. If youre interested in learning more about China, both past and present, China from Mao to Now provides an excellent overview of the countrys history, politics, economics, culture, and more. The lectures were engaging, the readings were thought-provoking, and the assignments (2 essays and 2 exams) were enjoyable and fair. In addition, Professor Ho was a terrific lecturer. In short, a highly recommended course!",
    "If you're at all interested in better understanding Chinese politics, I would strongly recommend taking this class. You'll gain a good base knowledge of modern Chinese history and how it relates to China now, which is also useful for thinking about Marxism and Communism in a historical context.",
    "yes, absolutely. I learned so much.",
    "Yes, I would. As far as I know, it's the only survey course on China that is offered. It is very well taught and gives students an understanding of contemporary China.",
    "Take it for an important look at the modern history of a major world power player. Workload, particularly reading, was very heavy, enough so to be counterproductive (I.e feeling overwhelmed and not doing anything as opposed to doing all of a smaller amount). Heavy emphasis on primary sources, which was great, but I occasionally felt at a disadvantage as one of the students who couldn't speak Chinese. Professor Ho was fantastic as a lecturer and worked to make herself available. The class is taught thematically (so one week's lectures might be Mao-era educational policy and current education policy, for example), and the first 2-3 lectures of the course were an overall summary of those years (key years, etc.). My only critique other than the heavy reading is that I wish that summary had been a little more thorough-- later in the semester, I often felt like I was missing the forest for the trees, and it might have been helpful to have specific details a little more grounded in the historical arc.",
    "YES! I really loved this class. I think the information is really interesting to learn and very relevant to everyone - China is such an important part of the global community right now but often so little is known about China's long history, especially the Mao-era.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student interested in Chinese history from the Republican period onward.",
    "This course is great for anyone who wants to understand modern Chinese history and contemporary Chinese society better, regardless of their background in Chinese history. It does an excellent job of presenting some of the most significant themes in the Mao period and today, and in connecting these themes across time. Professor Ho is an excellent lecturer, and she does a good job of engaging the class even during lecture; she's also very approachable and helpful.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The grading is overly hard for an intro lecture class, and the expectations are that of a (hard) seminar, not an intro lecture class. The lectures are also way too long and unnecessary for the course material. Unless you are infatuated with the internal dynamics of China - which I am not - this isn't the course for you."
