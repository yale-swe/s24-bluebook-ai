   "comments": [
    "This class is hard! Be ready to spend a lot of time on this class, and to be lost if you skip one class. However, it is better than L1\/L2 because of the inclusion of the texts -- you actually begin reading and writing at a higher level. Would I recommend it? Outside of the dis. reqs, maybe not. But, it's the next step up, so it's important to take it to get further up the French food chain.",
    "Yes, because the higher level French professors are amazing and it is worth getting through the rudimentary classes to get to the great L5 courses.",
    "This class is a lot of daily work, but none of it is particularly hard. The readings are enjoyable and very reasonable (15 pages per night), and in-class discussions were fun and easy to follow. Don't be scared by the bi-weekly tests as they're really pretty straightforward. Koundi is an excellent professor who enjoys this class. Some people thought she was a little intimidating, but really she is there to help and there to make French fun. I definitely recommend FREN 130 with Koundi.",
    "This course was a ton of work, but pretty good. From what I know of all professors, Koundi was about on par with others. Not as good as other professors I have had in the department.",
    "Definitely take L3 with Koundi if you can. She's an excellent professor and I feel like I learned a ton in this class. L3 is basically the same content as L2, but you learn it much more deeply and comprehensively. I'm now very capable of carrying on a conversation in French and can read most things. While the readings seemed very scary at first, I quickly got used to them. While this course was more work than others at Yale, it was easier than L2. The vocab and grammar we used were useful, and the tests were very fair. I loved doing the readings, I feel like I gained a ton through feeling empowered to read every word and understand the real meaning of Camus' words, for example. Overall, I'd highly recommend this class, especially with Koundi.",
    "Would strongly recommend to anyone with intermediate knowledge of French who wants to improve her proficiency."
