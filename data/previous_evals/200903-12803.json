    "It's much better than 110 and 120.Reading literature and watching films>>watching FIA videos.If you're thinking about taking 130, you probably have to, unless you're a freshman, in which case it's a very good continuation of your French education. If you want to take French, it should meet your expectations.As for the particular section, Mme Wynant is an excellent teacher. Class is fun and productive, and I found it enjoyable whereas I hated class when I took 110 and 120.",
    "awesome class. the work isn't too overwhelming and the material is very interesting. i loved all the books and movies.",
    "If you have taken French before in highschool (but are not a beginner), this is a review of grammar, however you do see the graamar in context when you read various novels and discuss them (somewhat). I would recommend it if you have been taking French for a while and you are rusty, or if it is logically the next step in your French scholastics.",
    "french 130 seems to be the level for people who have taken french in high school. there's a range of abilities in the class, especially in speaking, so that might be a little intimidating at first. but the class is great and you learn A LOT in a very little amount of time. in high school, even after taking 4 years of french, i never would have imagined i could have watched a movie and understood it. but i kind of can now.",
    "If you must take it, take it. Though realize it's going to be a lot more work than any of your other class, and definitely more work than any of the other french levels.",
    "A fun, interactive and educational class. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone. If you're thinking of improving your french, take this class.",
    "If this is your level, the course is perfect. I don't know if all Yale language courses are this good, but compared to my high school's it really is fantastic."
