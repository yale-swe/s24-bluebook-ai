    "This class was largely a game of catch up for me. There were no pre-requisites for this course and yet you needed an extreme knowledge in feminist theory, and music. Professor Brooks would use musical terms and not explain them, with the expectation that a student with no musical background would understand her.",
    "Taking this class ensures one will have a much deeper, more critical appreciation for contemporary music.",
    "Everything. Knowledge about American pop music, black people's involvement in it, and black women's role in that. Learned a lot of cultural theory, black feminist theory, etc. How to analyze and talk about music. Great class.",
    "Learned so much about the history of women and black America as told by these artists. Gained ability to critically analyze sonic or visual text. How to link these types of performances to larger societal\/historical truths. My first experience theorizing. Will never listen to these artists in the same way, as this class has added a new dimension to my understanding of music.",
    "Analyzing sound and music, engaging with ideas of blackness, understanding the history of black music in America.",
    "I learned to critically think about something that is ubiquitous in contemporary culture and often taken for granted as apolitical and trivial. It opened my eyes to the layers of pop music.",
    "A survey history of black women performers from the postbellum to modern era, and the theory\/cultural critique to analyze their performances.",
    "I developed a deep understanding of the history, politics, social trends, and sonic qualities of the many prominent black female vocalists who have shaped, critiqued, and been part of hegemonic American culture over the past century. I especially developed the tools to discuss music in an academic context and articulate sonic qualities using specific theories and terms from various scholars.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing!! I learned so much. Please take this course. It was so relevant and important.",
    "I developed my ability to analyze music based on all of its components including the sonic and lyrical content. Additionally, I built my close reading skills a great deal through my engagement with song lyrics and dense theoretical works, the likes of which I had not been exposed to yet.",
    "More than a sociological survey of Black women in popular music culture, this course opened my mind up to a host of deep-searching philosophical questions. What does it mean to be Black and a woman in America? How have the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow and the contemporary struggles of Black America informed African American and therefore American cultural production? How do we hear the innovative, ground-breaking work of spirituals, work songs, the blues, etc. carried forth in all the popular music we listen to today, from Rihanna and Beyonc, to Adele and Britney? How have Black women artists written, sung, and performed their way to freedom? This course taught me how to listen to music critically and creatively, allowing for exigent analysis that combined the philosophical with the historical. Professor Daphne Brooks taught me that academic work requires boldness; that it is possible and encouraged! to go out on an analytical limb as long as you can back it up with a solid theoretical foundation. She makes academia exciting, fresh, and urgent.",
    "I learned how to engage with dense theory and to listen to musical texts with a critical ear so as to bring out other perspective and dimensions within the music.",
    "I learned much more about American Studies critical thinking and synthesis.",
    "This course was a rigorous study of black women sonic and performative history. This course was comprehensive in that we analyzed historical events and black feminist theory in concurrence with the lyrical, musical, and performative content of black women musical artists.",
    "This course expanded my mind to think critically about the pop-cultural context we are surrounded with everyday. I left with the tools to think deeper, analyze, and develop arguments about the things I care about."

   "comments": [
    "really heavy workload",
    "This course was generally an awful experience. I think that professor brooks had very good intentions but the class simply fell short. I really had anticipated an experience like that of African American history with professor Holloway, and it was far from that. Professor Brooks expects entirely too much and does not provide any resources to provide students with the opportunity to fulfill those expectations. This class is advertised as a history course and yet is largely based on music and performance theory. Professor Brooks would throw out words without providing any explanation and would not give students access to her power points which had words and quotes on them. I was extremely disappointed in this course and expected it to be so much more than it was. It ended up being one of my least favorite courses that I have taken at Yale.",
    "The syllabus is pretty intimidating, but if you're able to get through some of the readings, they're worth it. Really great, fascinating stuff. Also, Professor Brooks is incredible.",
    "really really deep engagement with texts and musicians through music, literature, and film. Asking for a lot in a lecture class though. I think this would be better as a seminar.",
    "Too much reading - truly was unfeasible to try to consume all of the weekly reading while managing other classes (not to mention extracurriculars). However TAs did a great job of highlighting what was important for the week. Everything else was great.",
    "The lectures are amazing. There is perhaps too much reading-- they are all great readings but really difficult to complete.",
    "Sometimes the lectures were disorganized which made the notes hard to follow but Professor Brooks was always a brilliant lecturer. The readings were often overwhelming but always useful if I was able to follow it.",
    "A strength was Dr. Daphne Brooks' amazing teaching style. Her lectures were extremely engaging.",
    "The work was very engaging but was at times overwhelming.",
    "strengths: Section was the best part of the class. Movie screenings on the weekend deepened my understanding of the themes of the class and added a positive dimension to the classwork. Prof. Brooks was an engaging and exciting lecturer. Class material was always made relevant to current events and music. Weakness: Lectures were too dense and too perfectly pre-written to allow for full absorption of the material. Difficult readings never broken down or fully explained.",
    "In my opinion this course tried to cover far too much material for a lecture that met twice a week. As a result it was hard as a student to know what to focus on or what would be covered in class. It was however, fascinating material!",
    "I think the course scared many students away at first because it seemed so daunting. There were SO many readings assigned each week and a lot of music listening to keep up with. Throughout the semester, however, these restrictions were lifted and TA's sent readings, songs, and music videos that we should strictly focus on for discussion, which made the course much more manageable. Despite the rocky beginning, the course was really insightful to the cultural contributions of black women artists beginning with the late 19th century. I personally enjoyed it because it involved the correlation of black women performance with historical events, and I personally enjoy studying history. Overall, the course was very rewarding."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this to anyone. I think I would have felt better if I was an afam major or a music major, but I am not and this class was miserable.",
    "Absolutely not",
    "I would because I think if everyone listened to pop music as critically as students from this course now will, Yale would be a much better place.",
    "Yes but really know what you're getting into. This is far from a walk in the park. This might be your only hard class of the semester.",
    "Change your understanding of music and broaden your understanding of where to seek and appreciate cultural and historical narratives.",
    "Absolutely! It's a very insightful course that is interesting to anybody remotely into music.",
    "If you want a paradigm shift, take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. Whether or not you have a specific interest in AMST, AFAM, or THST, this course provides you with an important social lens and awareness of the politics of black womanhood, as told by the many black female artists who found their place in pop music culture. Also, Professor Brooks is incredibly smart and a fun lecturer, so I think it's worth getting to experience a subject she's clearly very passionate about and knows a great deal about.",
    "I would definitely recommend that other students take this course!",
    "Yes I would.",
    "You must take this course. We all listen to music by Black women or music that has been inspired (to put it kindly) by the work of Black women. But this course is more than a study of Beyonc and Iggy Azalea (though there is much to study there alone, especially regarding Beyonc). This course teaches about the history of Black cultural production: the conditions under which Black women artists have innovated music and performance in order to express sorrow and sustain joyful life. The thing about this course and Professor Brooks' amazing lecturing style, in which she gives her all, every single class is that it's not only informative, not only academically rigorous, not only inspiring and challenging with a well-chosen syllabus. It's also downright beautiful. Every class, you get to listen to the genius work of Black women musicians, and watch amazing performances, and look at incredible costumes. And you get to talk and think about it deeply, in a way and in a space that is so rarely afforded to subjects like these. So please take this class. You, and the world, will be the better for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Black Women and Pop Music Culture. It seems like a class that would only talk about Beyonce, but it is definitely not. You will learn about a century span of black woman sonic performance in concurrence with history, black and black feminist theory, and so much more. I'm a Computer Science major who needed an HU credit and found this really rewarding despite some difficulty in the start of the semester with the excessive amount of readings. By the end of the semester the readings were reduced and the TAs helped point us to which readings we should be focusing on. There are also weekly reading responses that are completely participation. This class is so worth it with Professor Brooks!",
    "Yes! Professor Brooks' excitement is palpable and makes the course material that much more exciting. You will never get to engage with pop culture in such a way. I would recommend this course to every student because Professor Brooks takes a necessary, truth-filled, and interdisciplinary approach that centers Black women...and if you don't yet know why that's important or how that's important, this course will provide you with the materials and critical engagement to learn why understanding Black women's roles (in everything and in American culture) is one of the most important pieces of knowledge you can carry with you in this world."
