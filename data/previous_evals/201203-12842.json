    "Its a review of the grammar concepts from l1 and l2, but it is definitely not as easy as you would like because they demand perfection and punish you much harsher for small details.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 130 04 to those interested in Spanish or who need to fulfill their requirements.",
    "Take it only if you have to for a language credit. I took it not only because I needed alanguage credit, but also because I genuinely wanted to strengthen my Spanish. However, this course didn't do me any justice at all. The entire course was a reiteration of high school sophomore Spanish (and not even to a greater depth - in fact, in less depth than my high school Spanish class). Although I loved the professor, I didn't learn anything the entire semester, nor did my Spanish improve in any way. Plus, my class was filled with extremely incompetent people who were just there for the language credit (or at least seemed like it), and that was a pain in the ass too.",
    "There is a lot more work compared to L1 and L2.",
    "Pretty standard L3 class, I think, so pick your professor well. I took it to fill my language requirement, as are most I assume. My section seemed kind of dead, but that may have been because it was at 9:25, and the whole every day thing is really a drag. That said, you probably have to take the class anyway, so take the class with Sebastian if you can. He is THE MAN. One of the kindest professors I've had at Yale, and he makes the class so much more enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone who is interested on improving their Spanish. The workload is fair.",
    "Only recommend this class if you have taken Spanish before otherwise you will most likely struggle. If you are just interested in completing a language requirement this class is not the most fun or the easiest by far.",
