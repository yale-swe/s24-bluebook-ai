   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for people truly interested in the subject matter or in art history. Definitely do not take it as a gut or as a mindless Credit\/D class.",
    "I'd recommend the course. It's a good mix of art and history. Because it's much more interdisciplinary than most history of art courses, I think it will appeal to someone who's not used to studying art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Istanbul is a fascinating city and learning about its history through art, architecture, and literature presented a holistic view of the city's development from a humanities perspective. Professor Nelson is a wonderful professor, and his enthusiasm for the course was inspiring. The workload is also very manageable with only a midterm, 10 page paper, and a final.",
    "Great class. Fusion of literature\/poetry, history, and art, with heavy emphasis on the art and the history. If you're interested in Turkish history, the Ottoman culture, and the Byzantine Empire, this is a must take. One paper, midterm and final -- that's the work. Very reasonable. Prepare for relatively challenging exams though.",
    "This course is wonderful as Istanbul has such an amazing and diverse history and you really get a sense of it from a historical, art historical, and literary perspective. However, as it covers so much time it is a very broad sweep of the city and was frustrating when we could not go into depth about a lot of things.",
    "The course introduces the history of Istanbul from the earliest times to the present with a consideration of political, social and economic history, as well as culture. I would recommend the course to any student interested in the humanities.",
    "Take this class! It has so much hidden depth. Through the lens of one city, you see the rise and fall of two very different empires. The information can be overwhelming at times, especially if you don't have much familiarity with Byzantine\/Ottoman history, but it's worth it."
