   "comments": [
    "A solid spanish credit \u2014 my skills definitely improved. Tedious at times, but a good way to reinforce the spanish you already know.",
    "Great way to brush up on spanish!",
    "I really enjoyed this class. There are a lot of homework assignments, but they're helpful. Professor Seymour always made sure we were prepared for compositions and exams. She was really helpful when I went to office ours and she not only wants her students to succeed, she also does everything she can to help them succeed in the class and actually improve in their command of and competency with Spanish.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is just that-- grammar that is not necessarily covered in basic Spanish courses, explored in more detail. Subjunctive, adjectives, verb tense, and relative pronouns are some of the topics covered in the course. Daily homeworks involve small textbook readings of different grammatical concepts, followed by workbook-type exercises. There are also short stories and a few movies assigned to read or watch throughout the semester. Other assignments include short papers involving a story or movie that require students to use the most recently learned grammar. The homework can be a bit tedious at times, but overall the course will really help your grasp of the language. Conversation is not necessarily emphasized, but having to talk about grammar in Spanish has helped me improve my speaking skills. Professor Seymour is very good at explaining things, and often will speak to the students in Spanish before class as well, which augments our conversation skills."
