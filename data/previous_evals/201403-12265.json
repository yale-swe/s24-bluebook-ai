    "This is the directed research class for psychology.",
    "I would recommend that other psychology majors become involved in lab work as soon as possible, but we do need more guidance in the selection process. It is easy to become involved in a lab, but not be involved in it since much of the work requires more advanced knowledge.",
    "Learn about how multifaceted and diverse the symptoms and treatments of anxiety disorders are.",
    "There is no reason not to take a directed research course if you are studying psychology. It is a great and worthwhile opportunity to learn more about the field of research, regardless of your future plans.",
    "It is a course for you to be able to do your own research in a lab. I recommend it because it allows you to have a different learning experience apart from being in class.",
    "How much you like this course very obviously depends on your project and your advisor. I loved my research and my advisor was awesome so I loved it. If you're terrible at managing your time and your advisor doesn't help you, though, you'll be screwed when it comes to writing that final paper.",
    "Take! The experience will influence your study of psychology at Yale and serve as good preparation for future research goals."
