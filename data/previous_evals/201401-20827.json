    "I really enjoyed that class (though I'm not a science major). I loved the lab component. It's one thing to learn science, and it's another thing to see how it applies to real life. It was a lot of hands-on learning. If you are worried about following along as a non-science person, don't - everyone is very willing to help out, as long as you do your work and ask questions. It is a lot of work, so be prepared - I put in a lot of hours into this class (though I enjoyed it for the most part). Professor Dollar is helpful and he really cares about the class, but he's not really the best lecturer - he may be disorganized and it may be hard to follow initially. Otherwise, I recommend this class, even to non-science majors. I think it's worthwhile to take a real science class at Yale. This class doesn't require previous knowledge of science and allows you to take advantage of the resources that the engineering department has.",
    "This course provides a solid overview of key concepts and topics in Mechanical Engineering. It is great for prospective MechE majors to take before they finalize their major, and even for non-mechE majors who are interested in how things are made.",
    "Lots of lab work",
    "I learned so much about mechanical engineering in this class. It really is an awesome intro to the major that covers so many topics \u2013 drawing and dimensioning, physics applications such as stress and beam bending, and gears and motors. Be warned, though, when Dollar says the workload is moderate to heavy, he means it. The lab part of the course is pretty manageable in the beginning of the term (3 hours per week and not much lab work outside of that), but the final project put tons of stress on me during finals week. He says there's no final, but be ready to spend 20+ hours in lab before and during reading week to get the final project done. Definitely worth it once you see what you've done, though. And the two midterms aren't very stressful at all.",
    "MENG 185 is a broad introduction to many aspects of mechanical engineering. It was occasionally challenging to be given brief introductions to things, and then expected to understand them well enough to do more elaborate problems. The lab work gets insanely frustrating, but such is the nature of engineering projects. On the whole, interesting course, reasonable workload, 7.5\/10.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was extremely useful for me as a prospective MENG. It confirmed all my expectations about the major and the career.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but is probably one of the more important classes to take as an engineer. Though it can be stressful, you learn a huge amount of incredibly important skills. If you are considering Mechanical Engineering, ABET or otherwise, take this class as early as possible--it will definitely help you decide quickly whether or not it is the major for you.",
    "Take this class if you like laser cutting. Don't if you don't. Dollar is actually pretty bad at teaching this class. It's a shame, because it has the potential to be a great intro engineering class.",
    "Super interesting class and a great intro to MechE but a big time commitment and not that easy. I do feel like I learned a lot though",
    "Take it if you are evaluating whether or not you want to be a Mech E major. This class is a good introduction to general Mech E concepts. The workload is moderate but increases tremendously over the last three to four weeks. There will be times when you would want to pluck your hair out but eventually it will be worth it.",
    "If you are really interested in knowing about mechanical design and want to have some hands on experience with it, take this class. But beware! It is a lot of work and can be frustrating at times. The 3 hour lab every week ends up being much longer when you count the work you have to do outside of class and the PSETs and the exams. I know a lot more about the world after having taken this, though, I can say that much.",
    "Whether you are an intended engineering major or a graduating senior, do consider taking this class! The curriculum is easily accessible, and the combination of lectures and lab sessions make it a very engaging class. You also get the chance to learn countless fun and new skills! (Solidworks, fabrication techniques, shops skills etc.) I think it is rare for an introductory level course to offer a glimpse into what mechanical engineering is really all about. Considering that the next time a student gets to do mechanical design is during a 400-level class, I would definitely recommend this to all freshmen considering mechanical engineering as a major.",
    "I would recommend this class to mech e majors. It got mundane at times, especially the lab, which takes up much more time than you'd think. Still I came out of this class with a lot of new knowledge and skills.",
    "I am glad I took this class. It was hugely time consuming (and I'm going to be a senior next year so I've taken my fair share of Yale courses), but still worthwhile in the end because I feel like I learned a lot of concrete skills in lab that I definitely thought were really cool and practical (something offered by few other courses at Yale). It's also very, very cool to see that you've built a functional toy car by the end of the course. Unfortunately the class is VERY disorganized at times, and also VERY time consuming (not necessarily only because it's disorganized but also because of actual lab time). Still, I'm glad I took this class and I would encourage even non-science majors to take this course!"
