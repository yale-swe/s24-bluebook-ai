   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are interested in the subject as it is pretty cool. Not to difficult as well.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interesting in business or sustainability. Note though that Professor Krosinsky has a background in teaching business school courses, so do not go into this expecting a course similar to one found in the econ department. The course does a really good job of avoiding the 'tree hugger' approach to teaching sustainability, but instead frames it as simple good business sense. I really appreciated this. Also, if you take it, make sure to read Thinking in Systems and Green to Gold - both are excellent.",
    "Don't take it. You don't learn much.",
    "If you're interested in the devlopments in ways to think about ethics aND sustainability in relation to investing and business this is a great class. The readings can be interesting and Krosinski is super easy going and knowledgeable. Sometimes class can be a bit dry and seem unstructured",
    "Yes, if you are interested in solving the sustainability problems through business. Cary is able to pull together many experts in the field to inspire students to generate new ideas.",
    "Take it if you are willing to challenge conventional thinking of business.",
    "This was a great course. One of my favorite that I've taken at Yale. I really liked the format with the guest speakers mixed with lectures by Professor Krosinsky and class discussion. Erred more towards the side of investment rather than business, but you pick what you write about for the midterm and final, so you can shape what you learn about in some respect.",
    "Awesome class. Yes. Will learn about business and investing from a completely unique point of view (environmental, social etc.) and Professor Krosinsky is awesome. The guest speakers are also great and very accomplished, so it is a great opportunity to be able to hear about sustainability initiatives occurring at large corporations today.",
    "Finance-oriented approach to sustainability. Students without a finance background should shop the class, and see if they are comfortable with level of discourse\/financial topics.",
    "Do you care about current issues in corporate responsibility and the intersection between business and activism? If so, this is the perfect fit for you.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the subject! If you aren't, there really is no point. It isn't difficult material to grasp, but can be boring if you aren't truly passionate about the material to begin with."
