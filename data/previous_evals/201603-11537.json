    "I feel really comfortable with Portuguese considering I've only taken L1, and I had no prior experience with Spanish. My friends taking other languages are always surprised by what we've covered - they say \"What?! I didn't do that in L1\" when they see me doing my homework. However, it wasn't significantly harder than other classes I was taking. As long as you keep on top of the material this class won't be too bad.",
    "Developing memory.",
    "Elementary skills with verbal and written communication in Portuguese.",
    "I developed a better understanding of not only the Portuguese language but it's culture too",
    "I had already taken Spanish to fluency when I began this course. Portuguese is a natural follow-up to Spanish. At this point I feel like I could more than survive an immersion experience in Brazil. I also learned a fair amount about Brazil including politics, culture, norms, prejudices, tensions, and more."

    "Yes!!!! Take this class, but take it seriously. It's not a gut. If you want to learn Portuguese and you are willing to put in some work, this is a great class.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes the Portuguese language is beautiful and Fabi is an excellent teacher",
    "I highly recommend this course with Fabiana DePaula. Fabi is an incredibly kind person who is always well-prepared for class and keeps class time both engaging and lighthearted (a difficult to ace combo). I took this class already fluent in Spanish, and while it was easier for me than other students, if you put in the effort you can learn this as a first second language easily. That said, do plan on ten-twenty minutes of studying every day. Some students (particularly, but not exclusively the athletes) tended to lay off the homework and thus fell behind. As the course is cumulative, it's very hard to get back after falling behind. A quick note: you CANNOT get credit for taking just one semester of a language. Plan on two semesters of Portuguese at a minimum."
