    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in world or diplomatic history. I looked forward to class each week because the themes were not only fascinating, but also directly pertinent to the world in which we live today. To really understand our world and the problems we face, people have to understand decolonization.",
    "Great overview of (de)colonization that tackles the big questions. Fun discussion and a manageable reading load. The course assumes some background in imperial history, and students use that background to discuss broader theories of empire and decolonization, and to examine case studies from the American Revolution to the Algerian War. If you are interested in empire and want to engage with some of history\u2019s most important debates, take this course.",
    "do it for the core amazing readings, from gandhi to fanon to teddy roosevelt. a class of ideas as much as history. just make sure you're selective with how much you take on of the reading. but yes, do this -- there are histories beyond those of america and europe, and you should be exposed to them with this deeply passionate prof.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It has the depth and challenging character of any history seminar, but is also very original in its outlook and approach. The reading load is very substantial, but other than that the written work is both manageable and enjoyable.",
    "I recommend it for history majors.",
    "I really enjoyed it! It's a great setting to read some of the most important texts in the field and learn about a really formative part of world history, and Professor Behm is a great section leader to do so. I wish I had gone in with more of a clear idea for what I wanted to get out of the class, particularly final paper-topic wise.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Behm is excellent, and I would recommend taking any future history classes she offers!"
