   "comments": [
    "Would highly recommend. Class is structured around about seven texts that deal with the concept of liberty. Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Mill, Smith, Tocqueville, Berlin, Nozick,Cohen. If you want to have a solid understanding of these important thinkers, definitely take this course. There are 4 papers and one oral final. A lot of work but you come out with a deepened conceptual understanding of liberty, approached from numerous perspectives.",
    "I'd recommend this class because of the course materials and the structure. If you're interested in some classics texts on liberty, take this course. You'll write four papers and will have a final exam orally that forces you to review the material and internalize it. All in all, this was a worthwhile class for me.",
    "It's a good course to take if you want to read the important political works of the western canon in depth, and if you're interested in liberty."
