    "The poetry is great, so just take the class and get it over with. It is an entry-level English class, but Professor North is super nice and the class isn't too much work. Whan that Aprill with his shoures sote, the droghte of Marche hath percd to the rote, And bathed every veyne in swich licour...",
    "Not as hard as people make it out to be. I would recommend it with this teacher",
    "English 125 is essentially a survey of four very important (and quite entertaining) authors. It is very successful in that it offers an in depth analysis of each author's work and a more general look at how these authors fit into the western canon. It is also not that much work--just five short essays and a final--and the reading is pretty manageable. So, I would highly recommend it to anybody who has an interest in these authors (or is an English major--though the two usually come hand in hand).",
    "English 125 provided a good overall perspective on the four major poets--Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. You learn how to analyze the works from them very well and minutely. However, the themes become a bit repetitious as the course goes on, but there are still some very intelligent nuggets of insight that appear with every reading.",
    "I was a bit apprehensive taking ENGL 125 during my freshman fall, especially since I couldnt seem to nab any of the sections that I wanted. But it ended up being one of my favorite classes. If you love talking about words and how the words fit togetherif that excites youthen you should definitely consider not only taking this class, but becoming an English major as well."
