   "comments": [
    "The class is a fun survey, low work, informative, enough to get you interested in a variety of aspects of astronomy, but not a very serious science course and nothing very intensive. I would recommend it because I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure that I learned very much on the whole for the number of hours spent in class.",
    "I would recommend it for non-STEM or premed students who don't intend to pursue physics or astronomy beyond the introductory level.",
    "This course I would absolutely recommend to anybody who has little or no astronomy background. It opens up an entirely new world in the perfect environment to expand your own personal ideas and beliefs.",
    "This course provides both an overview and an in-depth analysis of various physical and astronomical topics, ranging from black holes to the nature of time. A week is devoted to discussing each topic, with a presentation on the topic being provided by the professor and a few articles being assigned for reading and summarizing to aid with discussion during the next class. I would recommend this course to another student because it encourages both scientific and philosophical discussion and would be a good class for almost any type of student to take.",
    "Not too difficult, but very interesting",
    "This class has very interesting substance and it is not too hard. It has a fair amount of work and the discussions really help you to understand. I would recommend this class 10\/10 to another student.",
    "Awesome",
    "I would definitely recommend to others. Because it is so much fun.",
    "take this class it rocks",
    "I would describe it as an introductory survey course on the subject of Astronomy. I would definitely recommend it because it offers an opportunity to branch into an area most don't really think about.",
    "Take ASTR 040!!! You won't regret it, especially if you want to learn about the universe without needing to do the physics calculations behind it.",
    "This class was a cursory overview of topics in physics and astronomy including relativity, gravitational orbits, and the big bang. The class includes a couple of trips to the observatory to look at astronomical objects such as galaxies and, in our special case, a supernova. I would recommend this class to someone else. I think that a good mix of science majors and non-science majors makes for good discussion in this class just like any other. Being able to mix a bit of old-school philosophy (such as Aristotle and Plato) with modern thinkers gives a more complete idea of how thinkers have conceptualized time over vast periods of time, for example."
