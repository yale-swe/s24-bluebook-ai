    "Strengths: Professor Sprinz is a wealth of knowledge because he has had his own policy institute since the 90s and wrote many of the papers that we read in the class. If you ever need help, he is available for office hours and is able to give you a bunch of other resources\/names of authors that you may need for your work\/assignment\/paper. Content wise, the readings were interesting and every week we studied a different module surrounding the topic of climate negotiations. Weaknesses: Didn't like how this class was graded; we had a debate, 2 reading introductions and a final group paper. Workload was very manageable, but I didn't feel like I learnt much from this method of testing. Discussion is based a lot off of what your classmates have done in terms of reading, and a lot of the time discussion fell flat.",
    "The strength of the class is that it contained a good overview of the current literature regarding international climate negotiations. However, these assigned readings seemed to be mostly studies that the professor had authored. The class could be improved with a more diverse array of readings and classes that facilitated more debate amongst the students. Also it would help if the professor spent more time introducing ideas in a formal matter at the beginning of class because there would be more content for discussion later in the class period."

    "As someone who is new to environmental policy and interested in specializing in it in the future, this course did not really do much to reel me into the field. Content-wise, I definitely took away from the course - I learnt a lot about climate negotiations. However, the class discussion fell flat, and the professor didn't share as much of his knowledge in the class that I hoped (perhaps this is just because it is a seminar based class). This is my first environmental policy class here at Yale, and though I learnt much content-wise, for some reason I don't really feel very fulfilled after taking this course. Also the final group project that requires each person to write about 3500 words is kind of tedious and after a while it feels more like a chore to write the paper as opposed to being a process of exploration.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student, at least another undergraduate student. The readings were very dense and were strictly academic papers (many by Sprinz himself), and our class discussions had some good moments, but for the most part were pretty dull. I didn't find the professor to be very dynamic during in class discussions. He is evidently well qualified in his field, but could go off on tangents and would speak very technically about research he had done, which proved hard to follow. Also, his grading rubric was unusual in that many points were awarded to format aspects of each paper (never had a class that took off points on a paper because it lacked a student ID number) and he graded relatively difficulty. That being said, the assignments were challenging, as the class was expected to present solutions to the grand challenges of global climate negotiations."
