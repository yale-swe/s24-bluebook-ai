    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I had already finished my language requirement after L3 but found this to be a fun course to continue learning Italian. I especially recommend it for STEM majors because as an ABET engineer who has plenty of pset classes, I found this to be a great break to shift my mindset and prevent me from becoming completely burned out.",
    "ITAL 140 is the culmination of all you've learned in your previous classes of Italian but now you can really enjoy the fruit of your labor. You will be able to take your language skills to the next level and apply all the cumulative knowledge in a fun and relaxed atmosphere while still pushing yourself to the new level.",
    "Youve gotten this far with Italian, so why wouldnt you take it? If youre looking to take ITAL140 then youve already fulfilled the distributional requirement, and its your choice to continue. That being said, how much you get out of ITAL140 is what you make of it. There are about four COMPOSITIONS that you write every week-and-a-half (with a second draft), 3-4 TESTS, and two short oral PRESENTATIONS, and instead of a final exam you have an 8-10min presentation. The professor makes all the difference if youre used to having a Neapolitan, changing to a Roman will be a challenge to understand.",
    "Great class if you love all things Italian. About the same workload as the previous levels (nightly homework, some projects and tests, etc) but much more interesting because you focus on culture and growing your speaking skills. Would definitely recommend this class to Italian students, especially if Giulia is teaching!!"
