    "I would say it's a pretty good overview of some of the important signaling pathways. But I really do think it would be better if the organization was changed.",
    "Basically a more in-depth version of Principles of Pharm and Structural Pharm that focuses on signaling molecules. This becomes extremely evident when professors give the same lecture in both courses.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to a fellow student. The class does an excellent job at touching on all of the principles that we need as researchers in the Pharmacology Department. I would summarize the class as a survey-style class."

    "It was helpful in teaching me the details of signaling pathways that were tangentially connected to my field of study that I hadn't had time to study in detail yet. It was a nice overview.",
    "This course (especially the first few lectures on kinases and phosphatases) was helpful in my early preparations for my qualifying exam. A few of the techniques mentioned in measuring signaling may be helpful in my research.",
    "I work in a lab that studies signal transduction, so it would be easier to list topics covered in the class that I DON'T need to know, hah. It is very much a useful course for my personal research..."
