   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend - although only for psychology majors, I think it would not be interesting to those who are not interested in learning about psychology treatment and research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! You will learn a ton.",
    "Fair warning: this class focuses almost entirely on behavior therapy for children and those with mental retardation. Cognitive techniques are merely an afterthought at the end of the course. In addition, the tests are incredibly nit-picky and specific, so you really have to memorize the lists in the book if you want to do well.",
    "\"Principles of Behavior Therapy\" is a cool class, but its course listing is somewhat misleading, because it is NOT a senior seminar. It's actually a twice-a-week lecture, with two in-class exams and two big papers. There's a lot of reading, assignments are challenging, and the workload is heavy. What this means is that you'll work hard, but also that you'll learn a lot and be well-versed in behavioral treatments by the end of the semester. You'll have engaged in the scientific research process through your semester-long behavior change project, and you'll have a good handle on important psychological themes when it comes to clinical conditions and disseminating therapies to a wider population. So, despite finding the reading and workload somewhat tedious, I do recommend this class to fellow psychology majors. Be prepared to keep up with the reading and put a lot of time and effort into your project and your papers. But also be prepared to learn a lot from an amazing professor who's funny, entertaining, and an expert in this field.",
    "Relatively light workload, however both exams do require a fair bit of studying. Additionally the final paper can be challenging.",
    "Kazdin is always wonderful. He can make even the driest subjects entertaining. Definitely not a bad class to take as a senior seminar.",
    "Take it!! Great professor, interesting material, not too hard on the grading, and the project is really fun. Plus, everything you learn is relevant, I use it everyday",
    "AMAZING class with an INCREDIBLE professor - absolutely take it if you get the chance. I knew nothing about behavior modification practices before taking the class, and found it really interesting but also super relevant to daily life. Prof. Kazdin is a wealth of knowledge and is hilarious in lecture. Be aware: the workload is super manageable BUT you absolutely do have to do all of the textbook readings, carefully, in order to do well on the exams. If you know the textbook well, you should be able to do quite well. If you go to class, pay attention, and don't do the readings, you will be in trouble. Questions require fairly detailed recollection of non-obvious material in the textbook. It's not difficult to do well, just make sure to do the readings.",
    "I would recommend this class wholeheartedly. Really changes the way you think about these things. You might think you know some of it or that it's easy, but then BAM a new dimension about how to think about it appears.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is a great course in which you will learn the ins and outs of behavior therapy from one of the pioneers of the field. The behavior change project (implemented on a friend, family member, etc.) is both fun and informative. Professor Kazdin balances academic expertise with a hilarious sense of humor, which always makes class lectures engaging. It was clear that he cared about every student. Tests were comprehensive and required that you do all the reading thoroughly, but they were always fair. One heads up: this class is primarily about behavior therapy, and not exclusively about cognitive-behavior therapy (although CBT is addressed). Therefore, the primary emphasis is on changing overt behaviors, rather than changing cognitions or beliefs \/ considering individuals' motivation for change, etc. That being said, Kazdin does talk a bit about the current state of the mental health field currently (e.g. barriers to treatment, problems with the predominant one-on-one treatment model) and how these limitations can be addressed in the future, which is fascinating and very relevant to today.",
    "Do yourself a favor and take this class. There are so so so many strengths of this class (the material is interesting, you'll learn a ton, the subject is something that is applicable to everyday life and very real) but by far the most important reason is Professor Kazdin. Professor Kazdin is nothing short of a phenomenal teacher and person. He's brilliant (he's too modest to have mentioned this in class but if you google him he's actually THE most cited professor at Yale), he's hysterical and puts wonderful jokes into every lecture to make sure you're never bored, and most importantly he is kind and incredibly caring. He wants to make sure you really learn something from the class and he's more than happy to be there to help you do well. I don't care what subject you THINK you want to take. THIS class is what you want to take. If you have any interest in psychology whatsoever (which you obviously do, this class is all psych majors) then you should do yourself a favor and take this class. Not taking it would honestly be a missed opportunity for your Yale career."
