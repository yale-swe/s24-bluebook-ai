    "If you like music, and want to learn more about it, why not? The homework isn't terrible, just a couple hours a week, and the projects are really quite fun, so shop it and see if you like it.",
    "Good intro class, even if you are not going to major in music it provides you with a solid base, learning how to form scales, chord etc. If you are not going to use it for your major I would credit\/d it though.",
    "I would recommend this class, but make sure you know what you are getting into first. You have to be able to hear pitches and intervals for quizzes, and part of the final was a blues composition. I thought that I would be okay in the class with a little bit of music experience, but in reality, you already need to have a fair understanding of some musical aspect like performance or composition. Professor Dodge is very friendly and easy to talk to, so take this class if you can.",
    "This class definitely taught me a lot ,but be prepared for a bit of a work. It is totally manageable ,but this is not a class that someone is going to float through. The subject matter is very tedious ,but if you are interested in what you are learning then it won't be a burden."
