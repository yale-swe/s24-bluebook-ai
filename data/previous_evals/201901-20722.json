   "comments": [
    "You learn how to apply basic economic concepts to real life issues and situations in the world today.",
    "This course introduced me to some of the major topics and valuation methods in environmental economics, including issues around carbon taxes, forestry, and fisheries.",
    "More understanding on how to balance economics and the environment",
    "I learned about a new, smarter way of approaching environmental problems like climate change.",
    "A small portion of what I learned in this class will be helpful moving forward in a career of sustainability and natural resource management. Mostly though, you learn how to make the most profit from natural resources, not what is actually better for the environment. So be wary of that going into this class. Little of what Mendelsohn lectures and promotes is based on scientifically sound information. You also learn how to exploit climate change for profit; the professor explicitly states that his and the economically ideal amount of global warming is 4 degrees celsius; he's also said global warming will be highly beneficial mostly until 2050, and then we should start mitigating greenhouse gas emissions slowly. Though it's possible to account for human suffering in economics, this course definitely does not do that. For example, when Mendelsohn was lecturing that global warming will be beneficial to colder places because it will increase crop yields (incorrect) and improve tourism, I asked about the indigenous populations that live in the Artic who are suffering greatly because of rising temperatures, sea level rise and loss of ice. He answered that those populations are small and insignificant enough to leave out of calculations. I'm not truly surprised, but this course teaches economics that pretends that it's impossible to include climate justice and protecting vulnerable populations. Like most economics, it also grants corporations the same rights as individual human beings, so just be clear about that going into the course.",
    "I learned a lot about environmental economics and the changing earth. As a non-environmental studies major, this class was a great intro into environmental issues. It combined my interest in econ with this new topic, and I found it really interesting!",
    "I learned about how to efficiently manage natural resources in the environment",
    "Learned how to solve pollution abatement problems, forestry, water, land, etc",
    "I learned a lot about how to manage and sustain resources like fisheries, renewable and non-renewable forests, water and oil. We learned how to maximize economic value from these resources over time. We also learned about the different political and scientific approaches that are being explored in terms of managing climate change.",
    "I gained a very basic understanding of how people engage with natural resources as well as the professors perspective on which of these methods are successful and which are less so.",
    "I learned a lot about the natural environment and how different resources are allocated and used up.",
    "Learned a lot about natural resources and new ways to think about them",
    "Looking at topics of climate change and climate change policy through an economic lense.",
    "I developed skills around the economic study of natural resources",
    "I learned about how economists think through responses to climate change and the distribution of natural resources to people.",
    "ECON 330 covered the basic topics of climate change and how economic theory can be used to interpret and address these challenges. I would definitely recommend this course to an economics student who is interested in learning about environmental studies in a way that feels familiar!",
    "Great understanding of natural resources through an economic perspective\/using rational thinking",
    "This is a really great combination of traditional economics and natural history. Learning to think about things from an economic perspective was really interesting for someone coming from a more earth science background like myself.",
    "I learned about the basics of various types of environmental management and the economics associate with it.",
    "Skills in resource valuation and knowledge of climate change damage.",
    "This class was really not good, it was so disorganized, and the final exam was really random! The problem set covered material we didn't actually practice!",
    "greater understandings of economic interpretations of environmental issues",
    "A very substantial understanding of the economics of the environment. Very interesting material.",
    "Basic knowledge about pollution and abatement. Very basic",
    "Learned about economic models of pollution",
    "I learned about how economists study and model natural resource management and depletion, and how to evaluate those models -- especially in the context of climate change.",
    "I learned more about the intersection between economic theory and environmental policy. I also learned about the use of quantitative and qualitative reasoning in the application of environmental welfare assessment.",
    "I learned about different ways to go about solving natural resource issues, as well as what policies and ideas do not work.",
    "Basic Micro economics but applied to environmental conditions. A poorly taught class that is saved by the ease of its information.",
    "I learned plenty of applications for economics and the micro\/macro level of systems, equations, models that align with different areas of environmental processes.",
    "Economics involving natural resources.",
    "I learned a little bit out the current environmental situation from an economic perspective",
    "This course is an overview of the different ways in which the tools of economics can be used to think about environmental issues. The class covers a wide array of topics, from pollution to recycling and forest management. Overall, it is a solid introduction to environmental economics, even if Prof. Mendelsohn tries to push a certain political agenda.",
    "I learned a lot about environmental economics. I found it extremely fascinating and eye opening. I loved the content of this course.",
    "microeconomic skills and their application to public goods and environmental sustainability",
    "I learned how to apply economics in a different way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the sections and office hours. They help to get a better understanding of the concepts learned in lecture.",
    "While I am very interested in environmental economics and all of the course topics seemed important, I felt like the way the material was presented was very broad and lacking in substance. Professor Mendelsohn often presented conclusions from his research without much justification. For example, he discussed how geo-engineering might be the climate control method of the future. I have no problem with learning about controversial opinions, it was just frustrating to have to accept these claims because Mendelsohn glossed over the details of the environmental chemistry and the economic calculations. He was quite bad at explaining mathematical equations - I wish he had spent more time discussing the derivation of the formulas he presented.",
    "the lectures are arent helpful for doing homework. Sometimes for the psets, we never learn how to do it and the only way of getting it done is by going to office hours which they only have once a week at an inconvenient time",
    "The course could be improved if the lecture slides had fewer mistakes and were uploaded more frequently.",
    "Strengths: - The TFs were super helpful, fun and understanding - Professor Mendelsohn is very passionate, and makes for interesting presentation of material - Low workload and interesting concepts -Very applicable to real life! Weaknesses: -The math was hard to understand at times, due to lack of a strong foundation",
    "I think the lecture could connect more to the problem sets. Without the TAs, I would have been lost in trying to do some of the stuff on the problem sets and exams",
    "Topics were scattered and not covered on the final",
    "Lectures were a little boring at times. I thought exams and problem sets were really fair and sections were very informative and engaging. TAs made and effort to actively engage everyone in the section. Problem sets only took an hour (maximum).",
    "This class had very few strengths. The overwhelming number of weaknesses are too many to list here, but among them are: the professors lack of understanding how to engage with students, poor communication with his TFs, poor communication regarding his expectations of his students, confusing lecture style, confusing and poor lecture structure, and biased messaging without know-how in engaging with students who disagree.",
    "Strengths is the length of the problem sets- very manageable, and not overly long. Weaknesses- lecture gets monotone and boring at times.",
    "It is a little disorganized and the I found it strange that the lecture material and section material almost functioned as two classes",
    "the major weakness with this course is the lack of engagement in the lecture. there was no time for questions. I asked the very first question of the whole course halfway through the semester, and I had to raise my hand, wait five minutes, and say the professor's name before he noticed me.",
    "I enjoyed the mandatory section I think it helped me keep up with the material. However, it was annoying that you couldn't start the P-Sets until after section because no other resources with formulas\/methods were posted. I had section Thursday nights while the only office hours were Thursday afternoon, so if I waited until after section to do the P-Set I would have no opportunity to ask for help. That being said, I would often go to office hours and try to do the P-Set without any resources, but this all would have been made much easier and simpler if along with the p-set a relevant list of formulas would posted OR if there were office hours on the weekend.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, useful sections Weakness: repetitive lectures",
    "It's an interesting lecture supplemented well by the teaching fellows' sections",
    "Lectures and problem sets are pretty simple but not too interesting.",
    "I really enjoyed how each lecture was separated by a different topic - for example, one lecture would be on waste management and another would be on fisheries.",
    "Lecture was a bit slow",
    "This is not a good class at all, do NOT take it. Yes, it is a very easy Econ credit. But, doing well in it is so SO hard. There is no textbook, and you don't really know how to study, since there are basically no practice questions. The final exam was totally random, all the studying of problem sets I did was basically worthless. I have absolutely no idea what grade I'm going to get.",
    "Psets are VERY poorly set up. There should be more a sims Le office hours. Material is very interesting.",
    "The lectures can be made more interesting and interactive",
    "Can be more interactive",
    "The subject matter is interesting and very relevant. It might be helpful if the problem sets were a little more closely tied to the lectures (lectures tend to be very qualitative, while psets are quantitative).",
    "I enjoyed both the lectures and the sections of the course. Professor Mendelsohn was a terrific lecturer and was very enthusiastic about the subject.",
    "Strengths: TAs Weakness: The structuring of the course is odd. Office hours were held before 4 of the 6 sections, which was a big issue because the material on the problems sets generally tested what we learned in section rather than lecture. It's hard to ask questions on what you haven't seen\/fully learned yet.",
    "The professor is the largest issue with the class. His success in environmental economics, while commendable, makes the course seem bias to his approach to environmental economics. He is not critical enough of his conclusions and that is dangerous for a diverse class of students with limited knowledge of either subject who then take his conclusions to be empirical fact. It is of course an economics class, but a more critical lens to these topics would have been preferred.",
    "The professor seemed to include only specific information that was more economical than environment focused\/aware. He would lecture without taking questions and did not take recommendations for changes to the course. I asked for an extra office hour option for working on the problem sets because the only one we had was BEFORE the section in which we learned everything in order to complete the problems. He was not open to changing when the TA's mentioned improvements either. The topic and approach are so cool, but it was not what I envisioned. The lectures were good, engaging. Sections were the most helpful when it came to understanding topics covered in class or for the problem set work. The midterm exam was disproportionately more difficult than the final, in my opinion. Most of the problem sets had little to do with what we were learning as concepts in the class, the material presented in lecture was more qualitative and the problem sets were qualitative so it was difficult to understand how to begin the problem sets before going to section.",
    "Sometimes the material felt hand-wavy and arbitrary. I think the material could be improved to be slightly less abstract",
    "The strength of this course is that it provides insight into the ways economics can be used to think about environmental challenges. For EVST majors or anyone going into the green economy or climate policy, it is helpful to learn about the ways in which economists view climate. The main weakness of this course is that it feels strangely defeatist at times, with simplistic answers to complex issues that leave you wondering about the accuracy of the assumptions that are made. For example, Prof. Mendelsohn shows graphs mapping the cost of CO2 emissions mitigation (without explaining the assumptions that the models make about future technological improvement, damages linked to climate change, etc.) and argues that we should not act in a way that is coherent with a 2C warming scenario because \"it is too expensive - adaptation is much better. Let's aim for 4C.\" Really??",
    "Strengths: The content of the course is extremely interesting Weaknesses: I think the way the course is taught needs to be improved. These are the issues I had, which are also issues that many other students voiced as well: Many of the Psets were poorly worded and had a number of issues that made them difficult to solve properly (not because they were difficult but because of wording errors and logistics complications). There was only one office hours a week at a time when most students have class. The better time for office hours would be on the weekends or on Friday (after all the section classes have finished). The only time I could've gone to office hours was before my section had even met for that week, meaning I didn't fully know what I needed help on. Lastly, I think the delivery of the content in the course was at times very dry and while the content itself was incredibly interesting, it was delivered in a way that didn't make it engaging. More statistics, graphics, videos, contemporary content would really enhance the course.",
    "More focus on pset material in class",
    "A strength is that the information is presented well and the sections are very helpful. A weakness is that most of the learning for the problem sets was done in section, not lecture. I feel as though the information would be better learned if it was presented in lecture and reinforced in section."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. This is a good ECON elective if you are looking for one with basic math and rather basic economic concepts.",
    "Hmm... I'm pretty neutral. It's not a difficult class; if you attend section and do all the problem sets your grade will be fine. However, I was frustrated by Mendelsohn's condescending and repetitive lectures. If you want a broad survey of topics in environmental economics, I think this is a fine course. If you want more detailed environmental and public policy knowledge, maybe skip it.",
    "Yes, the material is very interesting",
    "Yeah, its an easier econ credit",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in economics, policy, or the environment. The content of the course is extremely important and would serve environmental advocates and government leaders well to know.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is majoring in economics. Otherwise, this class can be very challenging and not worth it.",
    "It was a requirement for my EVST major. After taking the course, it's easy to understand why the global environment is being destroyed, since people use economics theories like some of the ones taught in this course. Lectures were infuriating because of the blatantly scientifically and ecological incorrect foundations for the economic calculations, but I suppose it's important to understand how little economists know about sustainability.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the intersection of economics and environmental theories and study. The course starts off with introductory information and then dives deeper into many broad topics (pollution, nonrenewable resources and renewable resources... etc.)",
    "I would recommend this course because at the end everything kinda of comes together and mixes well with each of the concepts taught in class.",
    "Yes",
    "Pretty good Econ class thats not too difficult - but need good TAs to fill gaps between lecture and psets",
    "Maybe",
    "100%. I learned a lot and didnt spend a crazy amount of time on problem sets or studying for tests. The course material was very applicable to relevant problems in todays day and age.",
    "I would not. The only reason I got through it was because I taught myself everything during Finals.",
    "I would recommend this course to economics majors. It is a good elective to count towards the major.",
    "Yes, but only if they are willing to take time to self teach some material",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student if you want to know how to apply economics to the environment AND you agree with this line of thinking. there's very little room for opposing schools of thought or incorporating issues such as social inequality. do not take this class if you are merely interested in the subject, it's not worth it.",
    "Yes. The topics are very interesting and TAs are very helpful",
    "Solid choice for an Econ elective.",
    "Yes! I think it's a great overview to some issues that the economy is facing regarding climate change and other environmental management issues. The workload is reasonable and the grading is fair.",
    "Yes",
    "No NO. Do not take this class. My friends warned me and I still took it (since I was like \"ooh! an easy Econ credit!\"), but I really regret it now. The class was completely all over the place and is low key really hard to do well on! We had no textbook and got very few practice questions before the exam, so no one knew what to expect. The final exam was completely random, and a lot of the problem set questions covered something we had never really practiced in class\/psets\/section, which was super unfair! I have no idea what grade I'm getting in this class, and I'm super studious (get all As) and I'm really, really worried.",
    "It's pretty chill, so I'd recommend it as a mildly interesting easy econ credit.",
    "Yes, but you have to be willing to struggle through psets not because they are hard but because they are confusingly set up\/worded etc.",
    "No. It is really boring and you don't learn much. The exams are confusing and don't test you on your actual skills",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to a biology\/environmental studies student who wants a look at the financial\/business side of their interests, or an economics student who wants to branch out into science a bit.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I enjoyed the subject material and the intellectual challenge posed by environmental problems.",
    "I would recommend this to other students. It's a somewhat easier economics elective and the subject matter is interesting. Just know that you'll sometimes be frustrated and have to work with others to find the clarity you need to succeed in the course.",
    "No.",
    "Only if they had an interest in either topic and a background in microeconomics (1 course).",
    "It was an average class. Relatively easy econ credit but the weekly psets are kind of a drag",
    "Yes! You will understand how a large section of the field of economics thinks about climate, but be prepared to leave class frustrated more than once (don't get me wrong, it is overwhelmingly a good thing to learn about what a more conservative approach to climate change mitigation looks like, but there are very few classes on environmental economics at Yale, especially at the undergrad level, and if students only take one environmental economics class I cannot help but think it ought to be more ideologically balanced).",
    "I would because of the content. Not because of the organization of the course.",
    "yes i would recommend this course to another student",
    "Yes, it was very interesting to learn about."
