    "YES YES YES anything taught by Braille Hopper, or anything touched by Braille Hopper. SHE IS AMAZING",
    "If you can take this class! If you can't, take a class with Dr. Hopper! This class is engaging and reflective and was by far the best class I had this semester.",
    "It's great if you want to explore religion and writing. Dr. Hopper will be a great resource, and she makes the class a good space to talk about anything you want, whether it's your own religious experiences or just the readings for the class.",
    "Take it take it take it. Dr. Hopper is fantastic and everyone (english major or not) should take one of her classes before they graduate.",
    "Writing About Religion is a great course that really combines the writing and religion aspect- you will be doing research on religion, yes, but it's balanced by the focus on improving your writing craft. As such, it's a very personal course that gives you the freedom to explore both sides. Definitely not a pure religion course, more of a writing course if that wasn't already obvious.",
    "Yes. It is a very very flexible class that gives students the ability to choose what they really want to focus on.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale! I would highly, highly recommend Writing About Religion. You will engage in discussions about deep internal questions, develop your own stance toward faith (or lack thereof), and learn from diverse classmates. Then, you will take these fascinating themes and become equipped with the concrete skills to write about them. You will com away confident and clear. I would recommend this course to any student broadly interested in writing or faith.",
    "English 121: Writing about Religion is a semester-long exploration of both writing as well as religion. This exploration takes place in a variety of contexts, modes, and lenses: students gain experience and understanding of both academic as well as journalistic writing, and discuss and engage religion in social, personal, and cultural contexts. The class transforms religion from what is often a standalone aspect of people's lives into something that is central to so many different aspects of society, and the student is encouraged to explore religion's involvement in the different aspects of society. The class provides students with many opportunities to both understand the religious views of others, as well as to explore their own. Even though religion is the central focus of class discussion, it remains first and foremost a writing class; as such, there is no exclusion of students who either hold beliefs in contradiction with conventional religion (atheism, agnosticism, etc.) or hold no particular religious beliefs at all. The class provides students with the opportunity to engage students whose beliefs are not the same as their own, and so encourages students to question and engage their own beliefs in the process. For these reasons-- the experience students gain as both writers and thinkers-- I would not hesitate to recommend this class to another student, regardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof."
