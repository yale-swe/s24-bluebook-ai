   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course as an advanced linguistic and narrotological study of Greek poetry and prose, with attentiveness to the differences in questions and approaches that different genres and historical periods require. This is not a linguistics that reduces a text to a series of samples, nor is it a narratology that ignores the crucial aspects of syntax, semantics, and discourse modes that inflect any narrative. Instead, it is the perfect combination of both methods that sheds light on poetry and language alike.",
    "\"Everything you wanted to know about Greek but were afraid to ask.\" Well, not everything (time limits us, of course), but one gets a sense--and its a sense I never had before this class--of how it must have felt to be a speaker of Greek. No more running away from certain questions (\"why the aorist here\"? \"What's this 'de' doing here\"?); this class has at least given us some tools to deal with these questions. Also, it made narratology more interesting (it seemed like mostly categorizing to me before this class: \"So andso is such and such kind of narrator...this is prolepsis...this is paralepsis...over here we have a seed...oh look: focalization...\" etc.) because one could see how such concepts function IN LANGUAGE. There is too much running away FROM LANGUAGE in classics."

   "comments": [
    "I think I have already addressed this in my praise of the course above. My own future dissertation research will be greatly indebted to this course.",
    "I think I've essentially answered this in my other responses, but I'll sum it up quickly: I know Greek much better, and I can read texts with more nuance because of it. Good philology isn't possible without either of these."
