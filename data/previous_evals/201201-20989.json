    "Would be very tough to follow w\/o at least basic cellular\/molecular bio or familiarity with cancer pathways. But if you're interested, take it, because you can get by if you focus on assigned readings and your final is on the topic of your choosing",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. The work load is not bad and the material is extremely interesting.",
    "PATH 650 is a solid introduction to cancer biology on a broad basis. Look over the syllabus: if it looks like you might benefit from hearing about some of these topics, then by all means this class is a good one. There was a fair bit of overlap if you do research in the field, though, so just be aware that because of the introductory nature of the course there may be some lectures that seem a bit superficial.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Definitely recommend this course to others although its workload is heavy. I especially want to recommend to the students who might not be working on cancers to get longitudinal understanding of how cancers are initiated, developed and treated.",
    "yes i would recommend this course. covers all of the major topics currently important to cancer. great as an overview course, but also provides quite a bit of depth."

    "The review I wrote may serve as a preliminary literature review for my dissertation, and the biology I wrote about in it was expanded by what I learned about in the course",
    "More than anything, reading papers from different sub-fields within cancer research was a useful exercise for me as I carry out my own studies.",
    "Greatly",
    "I plan to do cancer research in my future career, and this course gave me all of thestepping stones necessary to do so."
