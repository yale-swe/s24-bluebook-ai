    "MATH 115 is a pretty difficult continuation in single variable calculus. The course moves quickly and the tests are very conceptual, so take it if you have to, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't.",
    "Take it if you need it for your major. If not, find a more interesting QR credit.",
    "A thorough survey of single-variable calculus II and\u2014to a lesser degree\u2014its relevant applications in other areas, this course is exactly as you would expect it. Its midterms were typically studded with more than one tricky question, so hours upon hours of practice and studying is a must. I'm not saying that the workload is unbearable, but you should take the class only if it's required for your major or if you have at least a moderate amount of genuine interest in the material."
