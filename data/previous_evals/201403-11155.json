    "A formal treatment of classic mechanics, beginning with Newtonian mechanics, progressing to its Lagrangian formulation, then to its Hamiltonian formulation. Interspersed throughout were other applications of classic mechanics, like small oscillations, coordinate transformations, chaotic motion, and Hamilton-Jacobi Theory. I would recommend it only if the student had seen most of the concepts previously, since it would have been very hard to follow the lectures otherwise.",
    "It's a quite standard class in classical mechanics, which should be known and mastered by any physics student.",
    "Phys 500 is a good course, and is important for a good understanding of physics at the graduate level. Some of the topics will be a lot of review, but the main corpus of the material will be new or, at the very least, more in-depth than most students' previous work in the subject. I highly encourage anyone interested in physics to take this course.",
    "Really interesting course but really heavy workload. Yes, but prepare to spend a lot of time on the homework.",
    "I would certainly recommend it to other students.",
    "Yes, recommend strongly."

    "Classical mechanics is the basis of most physical theories and there is no way to around it.",
    "In one way or another, everything in physics are extensions from Classical Mechanics (CM). So a deep understanding of CM such as Hamiltonian Mech. and the structure\/space for CM) shares insight to other fields. The same applies to research (maybe a bit less so.)",
    "very much",
    "PHYS 500 is a great introduction to classical mechanics. 500 includes all necessary knowledge, ideas and methods to understand mechanical phenomena around us. It also presents how quantum mechanics has its roots within classical mechanics."
