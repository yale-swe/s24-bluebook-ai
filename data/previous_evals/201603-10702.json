   "comments": [
    "This course helps students develop a strong understanding of travel and tourism from an academic perspective. You read academic articles and discuss them in class. Discussions helped me to think critically and engage in productive conversations with students and Professor Newton. The course also taught me how to prepare a speech, use the Yale library and its vast resources for research, analyze academic texts and annotate them. English 114 with Professor Newton is not only a witting class that makes you a better writer, it is also an experience that prepares you for intellectual exchange at the university level. You will also learn to work as a team as students have the opportunity to work in groups, receive feedback from peers and also offer personal perspective on peer writings. I think that this class is important because Professor Newton really does a fantastic job in preparing students for the vigor of academics at Yale.",
    "How to write a works cited page, how to organize an essay",
    "I learnt the basic structures of a lot of types of essays and it helped me develop close reading skills which will be useful throughout college.",
    "Writing an academic essay- claim, evidence, argument",
    "I learned how to be a much better writer.",
    "This course helped me to develop writing skills, including writing very specifically and precisely, connecting the various ideas I introduce, organizing essays in a specific, coherent manner, and changing up structure to keep readers engaged, as well as public speaking skills, particularly the ability to express myself intelligently and confidently when speaking in front of a group about readings, topics of class discussion, etc.",
    "I learned how to write and structure a basic academic essay, and how to do research. I also learned a lot about the controversies surrounding travel and tourism.",
    "I learnt how to analyze two different arguments and find connections in them to support my own argument. I also learned close reading.",
    "This course taught me how to write essays in the college setting. In high school, I was not exposed to this level of writing, but ENGL114 is great exposure to the standards of writing at Yale. I learned the importance of specificity and \"building bridges\" between ideas in a paper.",
    "From this class, I learned how to craft the \"college essay.\" Pam taught me how to write better and how to make my argument stronger. She taught me to use details in all of my writing and to hold your readers hand to guide them through your paper.",
    "This class gave me a very solid understanding of what elements are a part of an academic essay and the writing process to produce one. I also learned how to better understand scholarly writing in academic journals."

   "comments": [
    "The course is well organized, the expectations are clear, and there is an excellent balance between, writing, speaking, research and critical thinking.",
    "The first two essay prompt weren't interesting and didn't inspire me to write interesting essays",
    "Strengths: -fantastic and engaging professor -interesting and varied readings and other sources e.g. film clips and pictures -very interesting topic -variety of essay types to practice skill -seminar environment meant a lot of group work and idea sharing Weaknesses: -a lot of short deadlines -peer reviews not that helpful near the start until we had developed more as writers.",
    "Overall a challenging but great course.",
    "The readings in the course were interesting, but its strengths were definitely the amount of individual feedback received on each essay and the small, discussion-based setup of the class. The feedback from the instructor was very helpful, but the peer workshops were also important. Not only was it good to receive constructive criticism about your own essay from peers, it was helpful to both see what peers' were doing effectively in their essays and to have to analyze the writing techniques discussed in class in the context of an actual paper. The small size and emphasis on class discussion allowed each individual ample time to contribute and to practice articulating themselves in a low-risk, constructive, and respectful environment.",
    "I loved the structure of the class and thought the essays were really helpful and built on each other nicely.",
    "Strengths include the essays and the revisions and the feedback that I received in class. Some weakness include sometimes pam is not clear as she can be. She subtly hides information from her students, information which in turn ends up harming her students.",
    "This course was incredibly challenging for me. However, this was a good thing because it pushed me to become a better writer. I enjoyed he discussions, the content, and the assignments for this class. Perhaps the assignments could be better spaced out. There was one segment of the class where there was a very heavy amount of work due. This was difficult to complete with quality effort."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend the course for students with a passion for travel as well as a desire to understand travel on a more sophisticated level. There is a lot of discussion on the philosophy of travel, why people travel, destination image, authenticity, the impact of photography and marketing on tourism and the tourist etc. When you complete this class you will certainly understand travel, and travel writing on a deeper level. Take this class if you want to become a better writer and thinker. It is also fun!",
    "It's probably good for everyone to take an english 114 class to make sure you know the basics of essay writing.",
    "Yes, especially at the start of college. If you want to do an English 114, travel and tourism is so interesting and Pam is a brilliant professor! It is a lot of work, but a lot of resources are available to help!",
    "Yes-- it helped my writing a lot.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! My writing definitely improved, as well as my ability to read and evaluate a text on a deeper level. The sources we read were very interesting.",
    "Totally would!!!",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has little experience with academic writing at college level. The skills learned are useful across any discipline; the ability to write and express oneself clearly is an important skill for any person to have. Even if you are somewhat familiar with academic writing, the course is an opportunity to hone your writing skills and likely find aspects of your writing to work on that you had not paid attention to before. Further, the intimate class size and class discussion both helped me practice expressing myself effectively in front of a group and led to numerous close friendships.",
    "Honestly, I think I may recommend ENGL 120 over ENGL 114 because it seems more like something I would enjoy, though I did like the class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to others as it helps you learn the structure of academic writing.",
    "The question that the class seeks to answer is: why do we travel? Some of the readings for the class are quite dense. If that sounds interesting to you, take the class. It is important to participate in class to get the most out of it. I think ENGL114 is a great introduction to writing at Yale.",
    "Yes, but her grading is super hard.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to someone. It teaches students fundamental college essay writing skills in an academically rigorous environment."
