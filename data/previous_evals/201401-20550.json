    "Not a great class but you have to take it.",
    "I wouldn't. It was pretty dry, and I found myself not understanding most of the material.",
    "Biology 102 was a struggle. The Professors focus on in detail, specifics of concepts that make it very difficult to do well in that class if you are balancing other extra-curriculars or a difficult course load.",
    "I would recommend it if they need it for a requirement.",
    "You'll learn a lot from this course, but that's all contingent on how well you stay awake. It can be really boring - I recall falling asleep during lectures multiple times, and I wasn't the only one. It's a pity that this is an introductory course, because the type of work that you're expected to do is sometimes intimidating.",
    "Do not take it unless it is a requirement.",
    "i would not recommend it because it was not interesting and he did not make any effort to reach out to students who might not be pre-med.",
    "crazy",
    "Definitely don't take this class unless you have to. Lectures are disorganized and confusing, and the material is also harder than that of Bio 101. You will get through it but it probably won't be a fun experience.",
    "only if u have to!",
    "Honestly, don't take it if you don't have to or if you don't absolutely love membranes. It's exactly what you think it is, and that is an entire semester about membranes. I'm not joking.",
    "Do not take this class until it undergoes a huge change, and definitely do not take it with Mooseker. An accurate name for the class would be \"experimental procedures in cellular biology\" and the class as it is requires an extremely strong background in cellular biology, it is not an intro biology class by any means. Terms and ideas were used in lectures that were not explained. At least it's only a half credit class, so it won't do too much damage to your gpa when you don't know how to describe an experimental procedure to prove some function. The TF's give no insight into why you were wrong or what the correct answer would be when they correct the homework and the midterm (I received several homework assignments back with parts of what I had written in red and with a line through it, followed up with a simple, \"no.\")",
    "The curve is favorable, but the material is very hard to follow. Gives students experience reading scientific papers and covers basic cell physiology, but I don't suggest taking 102 unless you have too.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't need it. In other words, don't just take this class for fun. It's not fun.",
    "If Biol 102 wasn't a requirement for continuing biology studies, I would never recommend this course. It was an extremely unenjoyable, boring, stressful course. Lectures were boring, material was difficult, and the professor was not good.",
    "Take it because it's part of the intro bio sequence and it's a prereq for biology majors\/premed. Stick with it in the beginning because it'll be rough, and you can definitely learn a lot.",
    "I will preface this with saying that I dislike biology and had no prior experience before this semester. That being said, it is obvious that this is not an intro course--if you have not taken AP Bio, let this be a warning. The whole intro bio sequence is disorganized, highly catered towards premeds, and poorly run. This course in particular was very difficult, but what is nice is that it was difficult for everyone, as opposed to 101 which was basically a repeat of AP Bio in 6 weeks. Most people hated this course, and though I was not fond of it, I strangely liked it better than 101. At least I felt like I learned something (probably not, but it is the perception that counts.) If you take this course, it is probably because you have to. If you don't have to take 101 or 102, don't even consider it for a second. GTFO ASAP.",
    "Overall, BIOL 102 was one of the worst classes I have ever taken in my entire life. I will suspect that most of the course reviews here will not be very kind to Professor Mooseker, but I am going to try and be constructive because many people will end up taking this class. However, if there is any way you don't have to take the class, don't take it. Unless massive changes to the course infrastructure go through Professor Mooseker is a very very poor lecturer. I suspect that perhaps he could be a good teacher in a seminar, because is clearly knowledgeable, but he manages to make easy concepts as evasive as they can possibly be. He does not define any simple terms, and instead jumps into weird experiments that we cannot understand. The end result is that when there is challenging material that is hard to learn on your own, you will simply not be able to understand it. Plus, the structure of the class was not abominable; the post-lecture\/pre-lecture\/lecture outline\/lecture outline format, which has no clear method of converting from one form to another, literally made it such that it took a significant amount of time to find anything, so studying on my own was a huge hassle. The end result is that by the third or fourth week of lectures most of the class gave up on Mooseker completely. The reason why nobody knows anything is due to both Mooseker's poor teaching and the way that he crushes any student interest in learning the material. On Piazza everyone asks basic questions and the TAs (understandably) get frustrated because they have to answer these questions. Tbh if the Mooseker just made things clear at all there wouldn't be 8 questions asking what a lumen is. It is entirely possible that Mooseker's teaching improved over the course of the semester but since everyone (including myself) gave up on him\/on the class we have no way of knowing that. That being said, since nobody knows what is going on the averages are low and you are expected to do poorly on just about everything. But why does it have to be this way? Can't we just have a normal biology class? Yet again, Yale is showing through its introductory science classes that it doesn't care about its science students nearly as much as it does about its humanities students.",
    "I'm sorry to say that I'd only recommend that you take this class if 1) you are required to, or 2) you have a real passion for experimental techniques in biology and\/or learning about famous experiments that demonstrated important cell biology concepts. I came into this class expecting something close to BIOL 101, which was organized in such a way that it was easy to follow and mostly emphasized broad \"key concepts\" (which is what I would expect out of an \"intro\" course). BIOL 102 doesn't feel much like an intro course. The material, while ultimately relevant and somewhat interesting, is presented in a very confusing, disorganized and stress-inducing way, at least if you take this with Mooseker. Once you get down to it, none of the material is particularly difficult to understand, but the way that it is presented in lecture makes it initially seem much more so. If you decide to take this class (and you probably will if you've already taken 101), my advice would be to review lecture slides and your notes after every lecture, to rewrite important concepts using your own words as a means of studying, and to remember that even though the material may seem very confusing at times, once you go back over it on your own time, it won't seem so bad anymore.",
    "Mixed feelings on this class. Definitely learned more than I thought I had, but the lectures were very disjointed and jumped around a lot. Admirable in its attempt to break away from the typical intro biology courses in its deemphasizing of memorization in favor of critical thinking and reading of primary literature.",
    "Take it if you like biology, a lot of material to go through.",
    "I would not take this class unless you need to, which is why most people take it. It's not terrible but it's not great. You just need to get it over with.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student if it could be avoided in any way. If you're pre-med or a biology major, you probably don't have a choice, but DO NOT take this class if it isn't required for you. Bio 101 was awesome and clear, and then bio 102 happened and it was just awful. I feel bad about ripping this class so much because Professor Mooseker really tried to be interesting, but it was just the worst class. There was no structure and no explanation to a bunch of basically random experiments. It was like taking a 200-person lecture lab class without doing any labs.",
    "A supreme waste of my life. Good God don't take it. I don't feel like I've learned anything that will be helpful for my life, except for a little bit of critical thinking. Unless you want to go into bio research, I really don't think this is worth anyone's time, which is a real shame because I think everyone should take bio.",
    "All of the concepts are very important in any career in the biological sciences but the method to learning is not very fun.",
    "I would really only ever take this course and the rest of the bio modules if I had no other choice. Biol 101\/102 sucked all the fun and interest out of biology for me. Really, don't take this course unless you need it for your major.",
    "It's a gateway course for the other biology courses and it provides necessary background for more interesting courses, so I would recommend it. However if it's not required for your major, I'm not sure I would recommend taking it.",
    "This class is very difficult and requires students to be very interested in the material in order to enjoy the class. I would not recommend this class to anyone who is not deeply interested in biology.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Some parts of BIOL 102 were very relevant--especially the toolkit, which went over common biological laboratory techniques--but other parts seemed too narrow to be of use, making it hard to keep in mind the larger context of the material. Professor Mooseker obviously cared about his students very much, but his lectures were very hard to follow. The lecture slides contained so much jargon that sometimes I found myself googling every word on a slide. And yes, this course is like a second language. Everything I learned was from Wikipedia or googling. But it's a doable course, as long as you're willing to do your own legwork and keep on top of the material as it's taught. Also I never even got the textbook. I did just fine using Wikipedia.",
    "Good class, makes you think and learn. Could use better instructors\/organization",
    "Yes, if u r pre med or psyc neuro. If not, then maybe not because it's very intense.",
    "Only take it if you have to",
    "I would recommend Bio 102 to another student definitely. It's a much tougher class than 101, but it doesn't make it impossible. We have to read the research papers of real scientists and while it can be difficult to get through, it's a useful skill to have. Just be prepared to spend a lot more time on homework than in 101, it's a completely different course.",
    "BIO 102 is a wonderful class. It is definitely significantly more challenging than BIO 101. There are five PSETs (all requiring you to have a very good understanding of the lecture material), weekly journal club discussion sections, one mid-module exam, and one final. However, while this class took a lot of time, I found it to be extremely rewarding. This course was unlike any previous Biology class that I had taken before in that it focused much more heavily on application rather than pure memorization. The course content (particularly the tool kit units and journal clubs) will be useful for anybody planning on working in a biological sciences research lab. Professor Mooseker is very knowledgeable, and it's clear that he cares a lot about this course and his students. There is definitely a lot of support in this course (an active Piazza page and a couple of review sessions).",
    "Biol 102 can be difficult at times, and Professor Mooseker is not the most effective lecturer. Lectures often felt a bit like drinking from a firehose. I highly recommend reading the textbook, which presents the information covered in class in a clearer light.",
    "It's easy to get overwhelmed with the amount of information presented in this course. The various biological mechanisms and their intricacies can be incomprehensible and daunting at first. However, with a bit of effort and studying, most students find that the course is quite doable.",
    "Only take it if it is required or you want to go into research. This is not biology. It is experimentation. This is a great class for understanding methods and thinking critically, but it did not help me understand more about myself and my body. It is about developing a different kind of thinking which is a great endeavor, but it also turned me off of biology which I used to be in love with. It is completely different than Bio 101 which is a walk in the park. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS CLASS! Mooseker has good intentions but the length of the lecture leaves you prone to falling asleep.",
    "If you're taking BIOL 102 then you probably have to and there's only one option so... But in general it's a pretty good class with a generous curve. You learn a lot but you definitely have to have a good TA, try to get Nara, and also go over the lecture slides on your own. I would recommend because the information is interesting but other than that its ok.",
    "This is a challenging course, just because it doesn't seem like an intro class. However, the material is really interesting, and I learned a lot.",
    "Although I haven't taken 103 and 104 based on my experience in 101 and from what I have heard about 103 and 104, 102 seems to be the worst module. The material is boring and the course is difficult. I would not recommend this module unless you need to take it to satisfy a major\/pre-professional requirement as it is not that interesting or enjoyable.",
    "This is a class you take because for one reason or another, you have to take it. It's actually cool information, but you are going to have to put in a lot of time to do well. The jury is still out on whether lecture is helpful. Pro tip: create a very large study group to do the homeworks, because I think that is where most of the learning of this class came for me. The papers are cool once you learn better how to read them. Also, get Nara as your TA if possible because he is amazing.",
    "During the class, Biol 102 isn't the most exciting class at Yale, and at times it's painfully boring, but afterwards, you will have a much better overall understanding of cell systems and how cell processes work. The test make you think and not solely just memorization, but applying what you know from class to big picture questions.",
    "BIOL 102 covers a LOT of material in a short amount of time, meaning that the lectures go through difficult concepts fairly quickly and chances are you won't fully understand. A lot of people end up having to read the slides themselves again or maybe do the readings, which can be helpful. Piazza is also a very good resource if you don't understand something because the TAs as well as Mooseker himself are all very active on piazza. The material is definitely more interesting than BIOL 101, although it is much more challenging. In this course you also have to read primary research papers which are cool because you'll be reading the papers that brought about break throughs in Biology, but they can be pretty difficult to understand. Overall, this is a challenging course, but if you pay attention in lectures and try to understand things, utilize all resources etc. you should be fine. Professor Mooseker is awesome.",
    "Well I wouldnt recommend it to anyone, but it is a pre-req for a lot of pre-med or science related things.",
    "Cool concepts, sucky class. I wish someone else taught this one - Prof. Mooseker is great when he talks about microtubules, that's his thing, but otherwise it's hard to understand what he's on about.",
    "Biology 102 is a module dealing with cell membranes and organelles. You learn about fundamental techniques in scientific research, which are essential for anybody interested in science and about the basic functions of cell life. It is a difficult course that is confusing at times, but rewarding. I would recommend this course as it is fascinating to learn about the minute processes that occur on the cellular level, and it is an important building block in a scientific education.",
    "I feel like BIOL 102 is not something I would recommend to someone unless they planned to major in biology or a related science. It is a very difficult class with complex and complicated material that isn't entirely something one would expect in an introductory class.",
    "If you don't absolutely need it (which you probably do for your major etc.) don't take it. Considering that it is only an intro class and a half credit course, it is a TON of work, and unless you are very into biology (i thought i was before starting this course) chances are you won't learn much at the end.",
    "I would recommend the class because it provides you with the necessary basics for a lot of procedures used in biology labs and for future biology classes.",
    "I would recommend it. It is very difficult and takes a lot of time and understanding. I would only recommend it to bio. majors and premeds.",
    "You take it if you have to. BIOL 102 is the epitome of the struggle. Absolutely terrible. Make sure you have friends in the class, because they'll be the ones to keep you going.",
    "unless this class is required, i wouldn't recommend it. it made my life absolutely miserable.",
    "I would only recommend BIOL 102 to students who are very interested in biology-- this class would otherwise be especially dull and difficult for those who do not consider biology their strong suit.",
    "Absolutely do not take this class unless you are required to for something else you wish to pursue such as your major or pre-med. You do learn a lot of valuable information, as well as important thinking skills, but it is definitely way more trouble than it is worth if you are just taking it because you are interested or for a science credit.The class is very difficult and stressful, and the teaching might have been the worst that I have ever experienced since I began elementary school. You will not be happy you took this class.",
    "BIOL 102 delves deeper into molecular biology research than 101 by providing several looks at various experiments, as well as mechanistic procedures for the functioning of membranes and of the ER and cytoskeleton.",
    "Do not take",
    "Unless you have a strong background in biology and know that you want to be pre-med, then I'm not certain I would recommend this course. Although it is supposed to be an intro course, the reality is that it just does not cater to students who are trying science for the first time.",
    "Bio 102 is definitely more difficult than bio 101 and requires you to stay on top of the material on your own more. Definitely read the textbook or you will be lost",
    "It's a good intro bio course.",
    "Take it because you probably have to.",
    "Needed for premed",
    "This class is confusing and at times poorly taught. On the other hand, the material is really interesting and it feels far more in depth than any high school course. Most people have to take it for pre-reqs, but if you don't, I think it's still interesting enough to take for a science credit as long as you're willing to invest a lot of time and effort.",
    "Unless you plan to be pre-med, I would not take this class. Professor Mooseker was humorous but the course covers a lot of detailed information, especially regarding research and research methods, in a very short period of time.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who does not have to take Biology.",
    "Do not take it unless you absolutely have to. The material is hard and very dry.",
    "Important information and a pre-med requirement so a lot of people will need to take the class, but much of the staff was very unfriendly and did not do a good job.",
    "If possible, avoid this class, especially if Mooseker is the professor.",
    "The material was very interesting, and I loved the curriculum better than 101 (which was basically AP Bio), but if you must take half a bio credit, I recommend taking BIOL 101 if you want a good instructor. Ask others which TAs are the best, because they'll be doing most of the teaching.",
    "This is a great class. You learn so much in a short time. I would recommend it for pre-med students or anyone who is interested in biology in general.",
    "So I have very mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, the course is poorly taught and rather arbitrarily graded (this is coming from someone who did well in this class as well). However, Professor Mooseker is a very nice guy and a real expert in this field. Professor Gardner, on the other hand is unreasonable and really shouldn't be teaching undergrads if anyone at all. Keep in mind that, although Mooseker is a NICE guy, he is a lousy teacher. He can't dumb down things for undergrads- he's just too knowledgeable. You will have to learn everything in this class on your own, the pSets can be hard, and it will be frustrating. But if you do take the time to learn it, it is VERY interesting and cutting-edge material.",
    "If you like the experimental side of biology, I recommend it.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 102 only if you are required to take it. Although interesting, the disorganization in the instruction can at times very frustrating.",
    "I would not take this class unless you absolutely must. The material is very challenging and not particularly captivating, and this class demands a lot of time and effort. That being said, I realize that many must take this class as a prerequisite for certain programs so those people just have to take it like everyone else.",
    "This class is DIFFICULT. You may feel blind sighted coming in to this class from BIOL 101 because it moves much faster and the information is much more detailed and confusing. You have to keep up with the readings, go to lectures, and make sure that you clarify any confusion you have from the very beginning because concepts PILE up on each other and by the end, it is nearly impossible to catch up. The class did make me feel like I was learning though. You have to put in a lot of work but by the end, you feel like you've gained something.",
    "BIOL 102 is an interesting course that is made a lot harder than it needs to be. Mooseker is a really nice, smart man--don't believe everything you hear--but he's just really not suited to teach an intro level course. The most important thing is not to get discouraged by the sheer amount of material and Mooseker's mumbling because the material is really interesting and the class has a lot of resources from which you can seek help.",
    "I definitely would not recommend this course unless you have to take it. It is very disorganized and unclear.",
    "It's a tough course, but it will teach you to think analytically. You probably shouldn't take this course if you are just looking for an SC credit. In the end, the curve is fairly nice though.",
    "Biol 102 is definitely a tough course. The material is challenging to grasp at first because most of the material is lab-based. Learning the concepts behind the various lab techniques but not actually performing them makes this course challenging. However, Professor Mooseker does try to make the lectures as engaging as possible and he does try to offer as much help as possible.",
    "This class is not your typical intro bio module. When you take it with MM, you feel like it's clown school. With weird demonstrations and section debates, you'll feel really lost, right out of the gate. You and your peers will stay up late with their eyes glued to Piazza. You'll be there so long, it'll start looking like \"Pizza.\" Then you'll get hungry and realize it's breakfast time. Forget Mount Everest, because after failing the first midterm, you'll have a bigger mountain to climb. The grade distribution looks h'lla misleading. By the drop deadline, half of the Bio 102 students have some kind'a trouble breathing. And don't even ask about the psets. Wow. Even pre-meds start having regrets. I don't want to say that the class is too hard. You'll just have to work your behind off to leave unscarred. Good luck with MM, he's a really great guy. Take Bio 102 all, just give it a try. Just kidding, you have to take it because it's part of the Intro Bio sequence for all you pre-meds.",
    "Interesting, useful. Would recommend. Requires critical thinking but is very rewarding for the effort.",
    "BIOL 102 is a course that I would recommend you only take if you need it as a prerequisite course for a major or further studies. It is a challenging course and can be difficult to balance what you are learning with the grade that you want to get",
    "Well, if you want to take upper level biology classes, you have to take this class. It's tough, but Mooseker realizes that it is hard and I think tries to attempt to grade accordingly.",
    "Absolutely awful class. Do not take if not required",
    "A tremendous class. To be sure, it is more difficult than many introductory lecture courses, but it is well worth the intellectual effort. Mooseker is a brilliant man and a great lecturer (in spite of what you might be told). Of course, if you are only taking the course to fulfill a pre-med requirement, you may find yourself unrewarded; the course is experiment driven, with a focus on research technique and methods. It is, however, fascinating, and if you are at all interested in biological research, you will love it.",
    "Biology 102 is the second module of the introductory biology sequence. This course, especially, forces you to really think about the material, and as a result it is a super important to be on top of the readings and class material. In addition to presenting the concepts, Professor Mooseker goes into detail about the experimental evidence for these concepts. It is interesting but definitely requires effort and diligence to stay on top of the readings.",
    "If you're planning on taking this class, it's almost definitely because you need it as a requirement for your planned major or career. So nothing I say will really sway you - nor should it. The only information I can give that might be useful is to keep in mind that this class is pretty poorly organized and fairly difficult, but don't stress out too much because it's curved. Also don't be terrified if it's more difficult than 101. Which it is.",
    "Good",
    "A course that focuses on a specific molecule in a specific situation that has little relevancy in a broader scope of cell biology. So far, I would not recommend either module to another student. I learned more in a mediocre high school biology class than here so far. Unless you have to, do not take this class.",
    "Don't take it if it's not a requirement. Very detailed material that is not worth the effort if not necessary. Also a bit difficult for an intro class.",
    "This was a good class, but there was a little too much focus on too little information.",
    "Keep an open mind! This class is great in that it teaches you an experimental approach to biology, very different from BIOL 101. Many students get frustrated because of the un-organized structure of the lectures, but you can do well by studying the professors' slides. Overall, I would recommend it to another student.",
    "While BIOL101 was super fuzzy and warm, BIOL102 is much rougher. Certainly, the material is more interesting, but everything is more difficult -- the material, the homework, the sections, the exams (average on the final was 61%). It doesn't help that Prof. Mooseker is not a terribly gifted lecturer. If you're a bio major you have to take the course, but if you just need cell biology (non-bio premed, for example), I might recommend just taking the real cell biology course.",
    "Take only if you need to.",
    "If you're taking this, it's likely because of a requirement. So, two pieces of advice: 1. If you have not had AP Bio in high school, go to the enrichment sessions that Kathryn Gardner holds. They're very helpful. 2. Regardless of what bio background you have, remember that you're taking the course because you like biology. Sometimes it will be frustrating, but you look at real experiments. Sometimes lectures are confusing, but you're seeing real microscope images of cells doing things that people didn't know they did until fifty years ago.",
    "Be prepared for a challenge.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. I hate that that has to be the attitude about this course, but it's true. If you're interested in biology, don't take this class--it might turn you off.",
    "I would not take this course unless absolutely necessary for a major - it is very hard, not mainly because of the material but because of the level of expectations and the way the information is presented. It does present quite a bit of information, which is good for biology majors.",
    "Bio 102 is not fun. It's just a pain to go to in class and try to decipher what Mooseker is saying, and a struggle each week to try and do the homework. I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it as a prereq",
    "BIOL 102 covers a LOT of material in a short amount of time. Complicated concepts are gone over fairly quickly during lectures. A lot of people end up reading the slides themselves\/do the readings outside of class in order to understand that material. I would suggest you pay a lot of attention during lectures so as not to fall behind. Professor Mooseker is awesome. Although he's often difficult to understand because he goes so quickly, he genuinely does care for students and holds frequent review sessions. If you're active and constantly ask questions on piazza etc., you will be fine.",
    "Bio 102 is more material on cell biology than you will ever learn in half a semester. You will walk away, if you've put in some real thought to it, feeling remarkably educated. That being said, it does seem very intimidating at the onset, especially having just followed 101. If you really care about biology (or premed), definitely take the course\/you can't not take it even if you wanted to; it's not as bad as people say it is, just don't be surprised or frustrated if you have to go through the lecture slides slower and more thoroughly than in other classes.",
    "You probably have to take this class. I'm sorry. Hopefully you'll have a better lecturer or the class will be reorganized. It's challenging, but it is interesting. I wish I had enjoyed the class, but honestly I didn't.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Awesome course. Really fascinating material and a great introduction to the real world or biology experimentation. Some people struggle with the sudden influx of experimental detail\/terminology, but I think Prof. Mooseker's a boss and the tests are just fine if you read the book.",
    "BIO 102 feels like a whirlwind, and was not at all what I expected. It never really goes into the basics of what the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, etc. are - probably assuming prior knowledge from AP bio, which not everyone takes. Professor Mooseker focuses a lot on the actual experiments, which is interesting, and definitely different from 101.",
    "If this course were not a requirement, I would never recommend this course to another student. Boring lectures over content that feels irrelevant. If you actually like Biology as a subject, there are many other classes and seminars that stimulate your mind and interest more than this course.",
    "I'd recommend it, although most people taking it are doing so as a prerequisite. The course does a good job providing practical and experimental foundations for the material, so we weren't just memorizing. Prof. Mooseker took a bit of getting used to, but was very nice and usually did a good\/engaging job of explaining the material. It's not a gut course, and I might not take it as an SC credit if you aren't already interested - but no reason to dread this course. It's actually quite good.",
    "Worst Bio Class at Yale. You have to take it so there is no point in recommending for another student not to take it. You will work really had and still have no idea what you learned or why you learned it at the end.",
    "The best thing I can say for students taking BIOL 102 is enter with an open mind: most everyone says that it's terrible\/the worst\/super hard, etc. but it really is about what you put in. If you like science then get into this subject and I promise you it is actually pretty enjoyable! It does take time though to understand so read the textbook, go to residential college science\/qr tutors, sign up for enrichment, and use PIazza--these are all tools in place to help you as a student succeed, why not use them? I would recommend this course to another student because it reminded me why I love science and helps explain experimental methods so science studies (i.e. the methods sections) actually make sense! Be open, put in the time, and it will be a good experience. That being said, I would still probably not recommend this to someone if they're just looking for a science credit because it is a lot of work--problem sets, midterm, final exam, there are less intense science credits for non-science-y people.",
    "Biology 102 is a very in depth course that is particularly suited to those interested in studying human biology at the cell level. The class as a whole is very fast-paced, covering a wide breadth of material very quickly. Despite not being very enthusiastic while taking it, in the end I felt like I had learned a lot, not just about cell and membrane biology, but also about the processes of science and how to conduct science and reason through general problems. The class has a few strengths as well as a few weaknesses. First, Professor Mooseker is not interested in covering a certain amount of material, but only covering what is reasonable. He understands that what is to be covered varies depending on the preparation of the class, which is really helpful. However, the class is somewhat disorganized, and the lecture slides which are available to students can often be confusing and it is unclear what is expected to be understood and what are just examples. The class teaches a lot about general methods for conducting cell biology as well as other types of science such as how microscopy works and when to use different methods in different situations. This is very helpful because it applies to the interests of any science-minded person and not just somebody interested in the material, particularly premeds (whom the class seems geared towards). Finally, Professor Mooseker is a great guy with good intentions who wants you to learn the material, but he has a hard time presenting it in an introductory, understandable way. I wish I would have read the textbook more, as that may have helped to clarify topics that confused me. It is important not to fall behind in class, and to ask questions if you have them. Also, go to the lectures. This is key.",
    "BIOL 102 is a great contributor to the BIOL modules, and is often hailed as a favorite for many students who have gone through all four. It helps to have research in your background, other wise all of the PCR\/AGE\/Western Blot toolkits are going to be a little bit harder to understand. Having done them before will help you apply them during p-sets and tests. I recommend taking a biology lab simultaneously if you haven;t done research before. MCDB 201L is great for the spring semester--which is what I did.",
    "I would NOT recommend this course to non-science majors or those who are just looking for a science credit.",
    "I would not recommend Bio 102 to anyone unless they are really interested in the concept and have worked in a lab or have a great deal of background knowledge in the topic or are willing to devote a lot of extra time to the material.",
    "BIOL 101 01 is a course that is very difficult, but gives a good idea of what the subject area of biology entails. I learned a lot, but I would really only take this course if it was necessary for my major!"
