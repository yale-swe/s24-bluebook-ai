   "comments": [
    "It is definitely more work than other classes, but it is also worth 1.5 credits, so it works out. I would recommend the course to anybody interested in learning Spanish - its a great foundation.",
    "I would recommend it. It covers many important topics and places a lot of emphasis on practical Spanish - that is to say speaking and listening.",
    "It is a homework and lab intensive class that involves daily interaction and speaking.",
    "Spanish is useful. Take Spanish. Jennifer was great, but 8.20 in the morning is less than great. Don't take a class this early! Please, heed my warning! But if Jennifer is teaching it at a different time next year, she's awesome.",
    "Spanish 110 was a satisfactory elementary language course. It was fast paced and interesting. Some of the readings and homework were not the most beneficial and the online excercises were marginally useful. Overall, the course was a good introduction to a romance language, was well organized, and the assessments were challenging. I would recommend this course."
