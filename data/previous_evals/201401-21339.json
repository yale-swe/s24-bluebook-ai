    "only if you're BME",
    "You should really only take this as an engineering major because it involves difficult MATLAB\/signal processing concepts. It goes really well with BENG 352 lecture so it wouldn't make sense to take these two at separate times. Overall a solid course that isn't too stressful with interesting experiments. The final wasn't terrible either.",
    "BENG 356L is a good lab course. When the labs worked (microfluidics didn't really...), they were really fun and cool. We did ultrasound, NMR spectroscopy, microfluidics, microscopy and image processing, so if you like imaging or want to get a practical introduction, this is a good lab. Final wasn't too bad and the lab reports are not very time consuming at all. TAs are chill.",
    "I think this class has improved from previous years. The lab instructions are actually much more detailed and straight forward than previously. But organization and communication is lacking.",
    "You will be taking it if you are a BME major. It is not the worst course or lab, so try to enjoy it!",
    "I really did not like this class. It was generally a huge pain. The procedures were. It very clear and had a lot of problems that the professor knew were there since last year but had not been fixed. Having all the lectures at the beginning was really overwhelming especially for the microscopy lab which didn't have a PowerPoint uploaded. The grading for the lab reports was arbitrary. Lab reports with the same data and responses were given wildly different scores. What's move it too forever to get grades back and we never got a marked up version of the labs which showed what we got wrong, just a number. You just have to suffer through this class for the major. I would suggest looking over the power points thoroughly while writing the lab reports.",
    "You have to take it as a BENG major. It's probably the last lab you'll have to take. Frustrating at times, especially when the machines didn't work. Also, the lab reports were ambiguous in what questions you had to answer. The final was fair and you'll need to put some effort in studying. Some labs required more work than others. The ultrasound lab required the most work and microfluidics the least.",
    "Not as good as 355L and very disorganized. Spend time on the reports as they are most of your grade. The final is hard so keep up with the material as you go. Levene is not teaching next semester so it will innately be better, but don't get your hopes up. Did not learn anything form this class.",
    "Just make sure you answer all the questions on the lab manual, try to get the lab reports close to perfect because the final is pretty, well, tricky. And can be hard, if you haven't paid attention too much in lab.",
    "Most other Yale labs are worse; this lab is a requirement for BME majors, so almost everyone taking it is JR in the major.",
    "Biomedical Engineering Lab covers a broad array of specific topics in BME -- ultrasound, NMR, image processing, microscopy, and microfluidics. Each lab takes two weeks and requires a write-up usually consisting of answering the questions in the lab manual, and unlike in Physiological Systems Lab (BENG 355L) there's actually more than enough time to finish within the designated time period without rushing. Some of the concepts can be a little confusing during the lab time since all of the lectures happen at the beginning of the semester, but as long as you read the manual and do a little outside studying you should be fine. The final was pretty fair as well, with 3-4 questions from each lab. If you're taking the class you probably have to, but surprisingly this is one of the more organized and less-stressful lab classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, way better than 355 because less things malfunction. Overall a lot more fun too, and you learn a ton!",
    "Mandatory but not the best lab by far.",
    "Better than BENG 355L, as it is more organized and the lab instructions are much more clear. Professor Levene is aware of what occurs in each lab which dramatically improves the quality of the lab experience. That being said, the microfluidics lab didn't work at all.",
    "You are probably taking this lab because it is a required BME course. It isn't painfully bad. But it isn't sunshine and rainbows either. There are definitely times when I struggled with my lab mates in figuring out why our results were not expected. The TAs were infinitely helpful in debugging the Matlab or offering potential solutions. Find a good lab group, it will save you headaches and heartaches in the future.",
    "The course does a good job of making some of the concepts we learn in BENG 352 more tangible. I would recommend the course to Biomedical Engineering majors only.",
    "There were things that could be monotonous or annoying as there are with any lab class, but overall it was pretty good. You have two weeks to work on each lab, and the TAs and Professor Levene were very helpful. I'd recommend asking about the expectations for each lab report because it varies somewhat from TA to TA, and there isn't always a clear format. The final was fair but not easy."
