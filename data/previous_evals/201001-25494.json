    "Your russian language ability after L3 is not really enough to get you anywhere, and while L4 does not get a student to fluency it is an important and useful step. Meeting 5 times a week is a pain, but good to help ensure you are continually working on it.",
    "yes- the language is awesome, and you only really start to feel comfortable with it during this semester (still a long way off from fluency, but one starts to get a feel for it- which is exciting), take russian!",
    "You will learn to speak Russian if you take this course! By the end of the year, you will feel comfortable having conversations in Russian and you will be in excellent shape to take a summer program in Russia. You'll also find you can read some of the greats (Pushkin, Tolstoy, Lermontov) in the original language and being able to recite poetry in Russian is a great way to \"make adwantage with Russian girrrrls\" (see \"A Fish Called Wanda\").",
    "Yet another reason why you should be taking Russian. This is pretty much the same sort of class as L1, L2 and L3. Russia is just that cool.",
    "The course incorporatesgrammar, listening, reading, speaking and culture. It is particularly strong on grammar and listening because of the textbook; I felt like a lot of the kids in the class though were not particularly comfortable with the level speaking and reading that would correspond to their level of grammar. I would recommend this course but not as your last course in Russian, or without supplementary experience speaking. It's so important to be comfortable speaking to others, and that is not something that this classroom experience has quite gotten to.",
    "Yes. Russian is pretty much the coolest language Yale offers."
