    "I admit I never did the reading. Ever. And I still liked this course, and managed to cram\/skim quick enough for the exams. The WR credit is work, but if you pick a topic you're interested in it's not horrible. Might even manage to publish my final paper after the course. Lecture is rough (went every day, but don't know how much I got out of it) Sort of absorbed this course through osmosis not necessarily structure.",
    "I would never recommend this class. Unfortunately, this just isn't something I'm very interested in at all and the other people I know that took it weren't wild about it either.",
    "Interesting course. Lots of reading, but not too much other work.",
    "Even though Alex the Great is dead by lecture 2 this is a really good and interesting class! One paper (~4-5pps), a midterm (that he gave us a study guide for; IDs and short answers), and a final exam (a passage ID and one long essay question)",
    "good class about a period in history that isn't mentioned a lot.",
    "A great class about the Hellenistic period. However, I would also point out that the class is not really about Alexander. It is more of an introduction than the theme.",
    "A fun and interesting class with a relatively light workload. Professor Manning is great, although his lectures do tend to ramble and are not always very thematically relevant.",
    "I would not recommend it - it is dreadfully boring.",
    "Easy PI if you're good at cramming or know a lot about ancient history.",
    "It covers interesting topics and if you are interested in ancient Greece, take it. Not a lot of work for the class either.",
    "Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic World was a fun class with interesting readings. The work was manageable and the themes taught were applicable. If you are looking for a distributional requirement or a fun fifth class, look no further.",
    "yes it was a fun class."
