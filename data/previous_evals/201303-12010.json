   "comments": [
    "I'd totally recommend it. Especially if you're a former DS-er like me, this is a great class.",
    "It's good because the texts are interesting in themselves. If you like political theory, you'll get something out of it.",
    "I would highly recommend the class -- the workload is manageable, the professor is good, and the syllabus is extraordinary. It's rare that you get the opportunity to discuss such fundamental books at length.",
    "Decent class if you're reading the texts for the first time, but these are mostly all covered (except Tocqueville& Montesquieu maybe) in all the intro political philosophy classes. Also, discussion in class was rarely precisely textual, which I didn't really like. Professor is a nice guy though and gives great edits\/comments on essays you turn in",
    "Liberty is a good PLSC\/EPE course that provides an in-depth look into the work of five philosophers (this semester it was Locke, Montesquieu, Smith, Mill, and Tocqueville) and their writings with respect to the concept of liberty. The workload is really manageable in terms of graded assignments, with only three five page papers whose due dates you set and a short oral final, but the weekly reading is a lot of work. If liberty is a concept you enjoy considering with respect to philosophy, I would recommend the class. Lot of reading, but if you put in the time and contribute in seminar it'll pay off for both the papers and the final."
