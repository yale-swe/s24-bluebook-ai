    "Absolutely take this class if you want a broad survey of America's intellectual history. It doesn't go into great detail, but all of the material is really fascinating and requisite knowledge for any well-educated person.",
    "A broad overview of intellectual history in America over the course of the 20th century. In some ways, it's like an American history course through the lens of intellectuals. My high school history curriculum didn't cover this and I imagine many people feel similarly, so it was great to read authors like Margaret Mead, Betty Friedan, and Irving Kristol, who I'd heard a lot about but never actually read. The course's only real weakness is that it's pretty broad-based and you go through a lot of history in a short period of time, but that's the case with many history classes and not just this one. All in all I'd recommend - it's very straightforward, one paper and two exams with section, and you learn a lot.",
    "really nice survey class. hong is a great ta",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is very interested in intellectual history, as this course does not deal much with foreign and domestic history. Also the lack of textbook can make it difficult since you only need to rely on your notes. This course is also reading heavy",
    "Recommend for anyone interested in recent American history. Especially interesting for its coverage of neoconservatism and other ongoing trends in intellectual thought. Grading was reasonable. Reading was reasonable overall, though some weeks expect to read much more than others.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!Strengths:1. Teaches you about a relatively unknown component of history, yet one which has great relevance for us as Americans2. Very enjoyable subject matter, especially since it necessarily focuses on individuals, putting personal stories at the heart of the class. Combine this with an excellent lecturer, and you get a FANTASTIC class.3. Excellent reading list. The primary source reading gave me a chance to look into some things which I'd been meaning to read for quite some time, but which I hadn't yet made time for.4. Great freedom on the essay allows you to choose a topic which interests you greatly.Weaknesses:1. One can get away with Sparknoting the reading, and that definitely seemed tempting at times.2. With no textbook, one might wonder what other scholars' views of American intellectual history are. Is this how our intellectually history is typically analyzed?"
