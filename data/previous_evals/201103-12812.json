    "would definitely recommend this seminar, very interesting course, workload not bad",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend Hist 411J to any student of 20th century history and politics. I think this course does a great job highlighting the connections between cultural and political history; by studying one of the most dramatic cultural turning points of the recent past, I really came to understand the interplay between politics and culture as fundamental and indivisible. The subject matter is interesting, and while the class requires quite a bit of reading, the books we read were never boring.",
    "Yes. It's a great seminar. Interesting and worthwhile. There's work but not more than most seminars, and the professor is really helpful with all the assignments.",
    "Great seminar! Hidden gem! More people should know about and take this class. Really changed the way I think about modern America. Highlights major movements in the 1960s, but extended so far beyond that. If you are interested in Mad Men, civil rights, hippies, the cultural revolution, and the Cold War, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Yes! The comparative aspect of the course provides a very interesting way to consider national and global processes of change (and reaction) in the 1960s. Great exposure to primary sources as well as sense for the historiography of the period. Prof. Van Vleck is a joy to work with and clearly gets very excited to discuss the material.",
    "This class is a MUST take! The course material is fascinating, and the readings, while at times a bit boring, are usually shortened by the very nice professor. Since she was recently a grad student, she is quite understanding when it comes to long assignments, so she'll cut out a few chapters to make it easier to focus on central themes. The film supplements were really great too. The professor is also extremely eloquent and super approachable. She is willing to help with all assignments, so definitely go to office hours. Plus, the structure of the course is pretty unique: studying one decade from a global perspective. It's a creative way to analyze history, and it's certainly a good mind-exercise for any prospective history major to follow the chain of events through the world during a short period of time.",
    "Definitely recommended.",
    "Yup, great course material, well taught, lots of fun!!",
    "Really fun class. Professor Van Vleck is a young professor and a littl shaky at leading discussions but I have a feeling this class is going to get better each year.",
    "The Global 1960s is an amazing course that explores the Sixties Era and the political and cultural revolutions that occurred all over the world during that period, particularly in 1968. The syllabus is thoughtful, well-organized, and includes a great mix of primary and secondary sources, especially a powerful collection of films (The Battle of Algiers, The Baeder-Meinhof Complex, and Milk were all brilliant). Although the course is anchored in the fascinating history of the Sixties in the United States, the course is truly global in nature with more units focused on foreign countries (France, Germany, China, Czechoslovakia, Mexico and more) and international movements than American events. Professor Jenifer Van Vleck is a very understanding, open, and intelligent teacher who facilitates great discussion. Her strengths also include being a helpful editor and fair grader of the 5 page midterm primary source paper and the 15-20 page final research paper. Her only weakness is that seminar structure of a student presentation followed by full-class discussion can be repetitive. I strongly recommend this class not only because of the great syllabus and professor, but because the material is extremely relevant as the culture and politics of the Sixties still shapes our daily life."
