   "comments": [
    "This course is a wonderful look at 1960s\/1970s films, film history\/style, and American culture and history during the period. The film choices are great, the readings are interesting and not too heavy, Professor Kerbel is incredibly nice and knows a ton about film (though his teaching style is sometimes a little unthinking -- seminar was often a combination of his mini-lectures and undirected discussion, all of which was interesting, however), and the papers were short and not too difficult. Great class!",
    "Great class! You'll watch classic movies and just talk about them. You'll also gain a critical eye - watching movies will never be the same. Definitely take it.",
    "A fantastic course that is accessible to those with or without an extensive background in film, since the course is designed in such a way that it engages with the cinematic significance as well as the cultural context and importance of the films. Though the course is focused on such a specific topic (60s to mid 70s US Cinema) the course not only goes into a lot of depth with the subject matter, but also covers quite a variety of films, genres, and directors, so you leave the class feelings like you've really learned and been exposed to a lot.Professor Kerbel is fantastic - he does a great job of leading seminar with what he has to say as well as generating discussion from the students. He is also very helpful and approachable when it comes to figuring out paper topics. The papers are very much open-ended, so that students can take whatever approach (cultural, cinematic, etc.) they'd like to the material.",
    "This was one of my absolute favorite classes that I have ever taken at Yale. I have never been so engaged by all the readings, movies, and in-class discussions as I was in this class this past semester. I thoroughly enjoyed all of it. Our essays were fun to write and our discussions were really stimulating and I learned so much from them. The readings are really not bad at all and actually kind of fun to read.",
    "Take this if you don't mind sitting through films that will make you uncomfortable. Take it if you want to watch all those films that you never watched but always wanted to.",
    "I would recommend the class because I like all of his classes. The workload is not too bad and you build up to the final paper.",
    "Class consists of two parts: mandatory film screenings and seminar. If you do not plan on attending the screenings you should think twice about being in this class. As Professor Kerbel points out, movies were made to be seen on the big screen, not on a laptop or constantly interrupted. It really is important to experience films the way audiences at the time of their release would have to help you get a better feeling for how they may have been received. I would definitely, without any doubt, recommend this class. It is really enjoyable and pretty relaxing. You get to watch awesome movies that you might never get to experience otherwise and talk about them with people who know and love American cinema. This class was a blast!",
    "Very interesting and entertaining films; paper topics allow a ton of flexibility as to what films you write about; readings can be interesting but are never discussed in class.",
    "This was a pretty terrible class. The discussion was very basic and never succeeded at probing the real depths of what is perhaps the most interesting source material of any course I've ever taken. If you're down to zone out for two hours of friday seminar, watch amazing movies, and then put all of your energy into the papers, you could get a lot our of this class. Don't count on good seminar discussion.",
    "Great class if you love the movies of the period. Or even if you don't, you should. Take it.",
    "AMST 416\/FILM 438 was the best course I have taken during my three years at Yale. After many semesters of trying to avoid Friday classes, this course had me looking forward to Friday seminar all-week-long. Sign-up for the absolutely incredible film screenings and stay for the exciting seminar discussions, interesting readings, and Professor Michael Kerbel. Although Prof. Kerbel may seem dry and serious at first, he is an incredibly thoughtful, caring, fair, brilliant, hard-working, and hilarious teacher - one of the best I've had in my life.I strongly recommend AMST 416\/FILM 438!But please keep in mind that the reading was optional in-practice for my class. I still did some reading because it was interesting (Prof. Kerbel tells you the most important\/relevant pages to read), but there was no pressure to read and the readings were rarely mentioned during seminar discussions. If the reading becomes more mandatory and a central focus of seminar, then the course will become more difficult.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in film whatsoever. It's a great period of time to study and is integral to understanding contemporary film. As with any film class there are weekly screenings, sometimes including two films in a week which is tough, but the rest of the coursework is manageable. The only downside to the class was that weekly meetings were on Friday afternoons and screenings on Wednesday nights.",
    "It's a fun class where ou learn a ton about movies in the 60's and early 70's. The books are fascinating, the movies great, and Kerbel leads a very good discussion. The papers aren't too bad and Kerbel is fair --just really 3 papers make up your grade and class participation. I learned a fair amount by his comments to, which is always nice from a professor."
