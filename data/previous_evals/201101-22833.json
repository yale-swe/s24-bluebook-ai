    "Great experience.",
    "Great credit\/d class. Lectures always interesting.",
    "a cool class to see the history of the balance of power through past and present",
    "Not what I expected, but this ended up being a good thing. The first half of the course was essentially a history class, but looked at through a balance-of-power view. While this weighed too heavily on the history side for me, overall an interesting class.",
    "TAKE IT! TAKE IT! changed my perspective. Nuno Monteiro is fantastic. His lectures are both really entertaining and really informative. a LOT of reading if you actually do it all (like 120-180 pgs per class time), but it's all pretty interesting. No papers, just section, midterm and final. good class to take cr\/D, but also a good class to take in general :)",
    "yes",
    "Even though I love political science, I would not recommend this class to others who are interested in it. While the materials covered have a ton of potential, the class never went deep enough, so that it amounted to little more than a brief survey of the past one hundred years in international politics.",
    "Balance of Power was an amazing experience. Everyone should be required to take it.",
    "YES YES YES!! Someone who is not a pinko commie teaching a political science class!! It's real! He's a great speaker, funny, and the material is interesting. Take it!",
    "good low level poli sci class. covers a lot of material and lectures are entertaining. definitely recommend",
    "Of course!!! take this class!!",
    "Good Class",
    "Balance of Power is essentially military history of the 20th century. It's definitely an interesting class and you learn a lot. There are a TON of assigned readings that I literally skimmed the first week - they're really long, repetitive, and confusing so I would recommend not reading them. My section had each person responsible for presenting the readings once during the semester, which was so helpful as I only had to do the readings one week (everyone e-mailed out their notes). It's a ton of material to study and the TAs are pretty picky with their grading. Thus, if you don't want to put in a lot of time studying for the midterm and final, I would recommend taking it Credit\/D and just enjoying Prof. Monteiro.",
    "a legendary class. take it. \"BAHLUNCE OF POWUH\"",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. It's not an incredibly difficult class, though I think getting an A takes effort, but it's all worth it!",
    "Yes although I would definitely Credit-D it if you are concerned about grades. It's based only upon a midterm and final, 20% and 60% respectively. Lecture is entertaining, usually, until the second half of the course when everything turned to theory and it was assumed you knew all about the events of the Cold War. Quite a good intro international relations course though. It was nice to refresh WWI, WWII, and the Cold War in a slightly different light. ie not a history textbook. Lots of readings though.",
    "this class promises more than it delivers. Honestly, I would not recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was awesome. If you love warfare, or the history of the 20th century this gives a fantastic overview of the major conflicts and their causes. The readings are interesting too.",
    "A perhaps unreasonable aversion to computers and a paranoia of students not actually listening, but prof Monteiro is funny, and a great lecturer. the structure of class is easy to follow. The grading however is very tough.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Monteiro is absolutely fantastic- lectures are incredibly interesting but also organized so that it is very easy to take notes. He is also very approachable and just a funny guy! Before taking this, political science was one of my top three choices of major and now it's winning out. There is a lot of reading and a lot of weight on the final (unless he changes that), but it is absolutely worth it if you're interested in the subject. TAKE IT!!!!!!!",
    "Definitely take this class. It is amazing. Just an FYI about the readings--either stay caught up the entire year or go to lecture every time.",
    "A very interesting course, even for non-polysci majors. Monteiro is a very funny and efficient lecturer. A very convincing presentation of realism. Good analysis and presents most of the reading materials in his lectures. A lot of reading but lectures and section should cover what you need to know.First 2\/3 is a very interesting presentation of 20th century military history and the challenges\/ strategies used. Last third discusses issues America faces today and is more undefined(a littel less interesting in my opinion).",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a fellow student. It is a great course for anyone who is interested in the history of World War I, II and the Cold War.",
    "Balance of Power is a course that may totally change one's perception of political science. It captures the essences in the making of international relations. It is very interesting and engaging. Take it! Best class ever!",
    "Great course. You basically cover the history of wars from WW1 and how nations gained and lost power. It is pretty interesting material and worth taking. Prof. Monteiro is a pretty good lecturer too.",
    "OMG definitely.",
    "See above",
    "It's a very good course. take it!",
    "Highly recommended. BoP offers a comprehensive framework for understanding world affairs and relations between states, beginning pre-WWI to modern times. The lectures are fantastic, and the subjects Professor Monteiro picks are well chosen - in spite of being a large lecture, I feel like I gained a lot from this course. Readings are good, if a bit long, but the workload overall is quite low - just a midterm and a final. If you can, get in the section with Dai - he's an excellent TA, leads great discussions, and is immensely cool.",
    "One part international history, one part international relations theory, one part current affairs and foreign policy - for the vast majority of non-Polisci majors, this class will provide everything you might need to know to know to discuss global politics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It analyzes international relations theories regarding the \"balance of power\" and the international system. The class looks at all of the past major conflicts that have occurred since 1900. Again, Professor Monteiro truly made this class.",
    "It's not a bad class since lecture is always really interesting. However, be warned that there is an absurd amount of reading, which makes the class overwhelming at times.",
    "It's a worthwhile class. I found the first half, military history and strategy in WWI and II, fascinating. The second half was drier because it was all theory that cannot be proved about whether nukes are stabilizing or not, whether US hegemony will last, etc.Don't buy the books. Or do the readings. Just go to lecture take good notes, and, for the exams, memorize the laundry-lists he makes when he lectures. It's not a hard class; I'd say it's a gut.",
    "Great and interesting class. It would be a lot better if he used a powerpoint in class to augment the lecture. Grading by the TFs seemed a lot harder than expected and a little inconsistent.",
    "Balance of Power is a course where you learn how the international power and political sphere has transformed over time. It is a very interesting course and I would recommend it to other students",
    "If you are at all interested in polisci, take this class. Even if you are not and just want a good class, take this class. It is about the balance of power throughout the 20th century and gives you a framework for analyzing U.S. grand strategy and the coming decades. TAKE IT OR REGRET IT.",
    "Balance of Power seems at first to be solely about realism. However, the course is in fact a combination history\/international relations (IR) class. You learn about power and wars from 1900 to the present, and see how the different issues of power have todo with everything. The subject's very interesting, but at times it may seem a little poorly-organized, especially if you're used to science\/math courses.Overall, though, it's one of the best introductory IR lectures out there. States do still think in terms of power, and it not only teaches you realism, nuclear arms' effects, and other power-affecting issues, it puts them firmly in the present context. Also, the only hand-in work is two exams and a section presentation. It's an interesting, moderately easy course. The readings are sort of optional, but you get a lot out of them if you actually do certain ones.",
    "I would definitely recommend BoP- take it for sure!",
    "The professor makes this class worth it. Take it credit d because it's hard.",
    "Take it. Go to lectures and listen carefully.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. Professor Monteiro is amazing and hilarious and the course material is really interesting and relevant. There is a lot of reading, but it is really interesting reading so it doesn't matter too much.",
    "Great overview of IR theory. I hate mandatory sections, as will you too if you already understand the basics of IR which will be reviewed in painful detail. But the lecture itself is very good and the readings are fantastic.",
    "Yes, it is a great course which really allows one to focus on a realist approach to international relations.",
    "Take it for a grade if you are good at ID questions and essay exams. Take it credit\/d\/fail otherwise.I thought this would be an easy course but I still started it off Credit\/D\/Fail just to be careful. I ended up keeping it that way because I messed up the first exam, and once you mess that up there's not much you can do to improve your score because all that's left in the final and your section grade.Also professor Nuno mentioned that he would probably make the course harder in the future, so keep that in mind.There's a ridiculous amount of reading for this class, but I pretty much didn't do any of it after the midterm because A. All that reading didn't help me do any better, and B. You can just talk in section and seem like you know what you are talking about.I studied 15 minutes for the final and ended up with a better score, so I don't know if there's much point in doing the readings other than that they can be interesting reads.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! You can gain a lot if you do the reading and participate in section. If you don't, you can still do well in the class, and the lectures are a lot of fun. Professor Monteiro is hilarious.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is very interesting, and at the end you actually start thinking about issues and news you hear in terms of concepts outlined in the class.",
    "Great class, lectures are interesting, readings are also interesting though some are kind of long and tedious, the midterm and final are fair. Professor Monteiro is funny and engaging. Class was very organized.",
    "A very interesting class with little work, but the grading was difficult to understand and somewhat arbitrary.",
    "Take it! You will have to memorize a lot of technical facts, but it is only a midterm and a final, which is nice.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. One of the best I took this year. Readings are very rewarding if you take the time to make sure you understand them and Nuno is THE MAN! Be prepared for a very realist-biased outlook though, and occasional jabs at liberalism.",
    "highly recommended!",
    "Awesome credit\/d",
    "Good course. Begins with basic IR theory, moves on to history\/analysis of the World Wars, then Cold War, and ends with lengthy examination of American dominance of today's world. A lot of reading, but it's not necessary to do it as long as you attend lecture - Nuno outlines everything you need to know.",
    "TAKE IT. A great class, but it ain't easy. Lecture is phenomenal, I always wish I had more than 100 minutes a week to listen to Nuno. Beware the readings: there's tons of them. You don't need to do all of them (some aren't that relevant), but you do definitely need to do some of them to do well in section and on the tests. As for which ones are important, it's up to you to skim them\/read beginnings and ends and figure it out. They can be pretty difficult. Go to the first couple of lectures, and if you love Nuno as much as everyone else, take the class. Just don't slack off (or do and take it credit\/d)",
    "great lecture course about the dynamics of international politics. takes esp if you need a So.",
    "Definitely recommend it. It helps if you are familiar with the great wars history but you can still take it.",
    "Absolutely Amazing professor. Insane amount of reading (much of which doesn't have to be read). Tests were fair, except the grading was pretty harsh. Extremely enjoyable class and has me considering majoring in political science.",
    "Take it even if you are not into politics. The course is mainly on great power politics covering the history of the world wars and cold war up to present. The lectures are always interesting and well prepared. The exams, one midterm and a final are not too difficult but it is rather unclear how they are graded especially because they are mostly essays and ids.",
    "Look at your schedule, and then get rid of anything that may conflict with this class. If you do so you will be treated to one of Yale's best professors, and an exciting area of political theory that requires no previous knowledge of the subject. You must take this class, regaurdless of your major.",
    "This is an awesome class, but I think it would have been very stressful if I didn't take it credit\/D\/F. I found that my midterm was graded harshly, but I also know my timed essay writing skills aren't very good. I highly recommend starting out credit\/D\/F, and if you do well, change it to a grade. But regardless you will never get bored in lecture.",
    "BOP is a great introduction to international dynamics since WWI-- if you think you're interested in how the world works, take this class. If not, the class isn't good enough to take \"just because\". Credit D makes this a great gut class-- it's nearly impossible to fail.",
    "definitely take it!",
    "This is a history of the balance of power from 1900 to modern day. It has enough theory to let you organize all that you learn, but is very historical as well. It's a great course; a must take.",
    "YES. It's one of those classes you've got to take. You'll get a comprehensive view of world politics in terms of Balance of Power theory. The work load is not that much and the exams are easy as long as you've gone to all the lectures and have kept up with the main themes of the course. Professor Monteiro is the boss. He'll always keep you engaged in the class with his humor and the way he covers the material is superb. Take this class. You won't be dissapointed.",
    "This class does a great job of filling an important hole in the education offered at Yale -- a serious study of military history and theory. Unlike David Blight or Jay Winter, this is not \"social history\" masquerading as a study of war.",
    "This is a great class with interesting materials and a new perspective on historical events and political concepts and strategies. The lectures are very engaging and rich in contents, with great lecture structure and speaking manner. The amount of reading is somewhat intimidating, but if you really love the topics and concepts, you will enjoy the reading process, which will get you well prepared for the lecture, the section as well as the exams. One important thing to pay attention to is the grading. The final takes up 60%, a ridiculous portion of the final grade. And if they don\u0092t change it in the future, be ready for a somewhat stressful final that will pretty much determine your final grade. In other words, it might also be a good choice to take the class as Credit\/D\/Fail. But overall, a challenging but interesting and rewarding class.",
    "I would totally recommend this class for every student! It gives you a very good insight in the 20th and 21st century! The professor is an amazing lecturer. Just keep in mind that the readings are super long and unnecessary sometimes.",
    "Interesting readings, good structure of lecture + discussion section. I have very little political science background, but the workload was not unmanageable and the readings were digestible as well (and I have definitely learned a lot). A slightly closer correspondence between readings and lecture content might be nice, though this wasn't a big issue for me. I believe Professor Monteiro is transitioning to powerpoint lectures, though. Professor Monteiro is extremely knowledgeable and a very engaging lecturer. His presentation of even very abstract or nuanced concepts was very clear. Mai Truong is an amazing section leader.",
    "Its a course about everything important during the 20th century. A good course for somebody with prior political science knowledge. I would absolutely recommend this course to any student that is willing to put in the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, for Monteiro alone.",
    "*Disclaimer: I'm not a poli sci major*This course was average overall. Nuno is a character and clearly very knowledgeable about his field. However, the material is not all that interesting overall, especially the theory stuff which appears at the very beginning as well as throughout the second half. The bets part of the course was understanding the run-up to WWI and WWII. Then again, I'm a history major. The first half is definitely more historical while the second-half includes a lot more on topics such as nuclear arms theory, US military strategy in the 21st century, military technology, etc. (more theory).Section was virtually pointless as we discussed readings that hardly anyone did. Readings are really long and dense. It's almost as if Nuno expects us not to do them.TAs were very strict in grading the exams--a midterm (20% of grade) and a final (60%). This may have just been a mechanism of intense TAs though.",
    "Liked the class - I enjoyed many of the lectures especially the first semester lectures, and they are much more helpful than the loads of reading that I never got around to read.",
    "This was an excellent course. Ilearned a lot, and we spent a good deal of time on the more recent issues like terrorism, Iraq and Afghanistan, and China, which I was more interested in than WWI and WWII. But even so, I still really enjoyed this portion of the class. It's well balanced between military tactics and battles, broader themes, and different authors' perspectives.Professor Monteiro is amazing. I definitely was much more interested in the material simply because Professor Montiero was the one lecturing on it. He managed to make everything funny and interesting. Monteiro even manages to make the theory portion interesting. I also loved the way he structured his lectures, and his numerous lists as he covered each topic, because they made studying that much easier. Professor Monteiro made balance of power a great class.Definitely get Suon as a TA if you can. I was a little intimidated at first because she wanted to give us pop quizzes (though it was great that they weren't graded) and presentations, but by going to section and paying attention, I actually managed to get by with doing less of the readings because Suon focused so well on all the great points of the lecture and readings.",
    "Yes, this is arguably the best course at Yale and certainly the best I have taken. The lectures are short and fascinating and the sections are easy. The topics covered are very interesting and help explain many things happening today in the world.Also the workload is very small - section and then two exams.",
    "I would recommend Balance of Power to anyone who has an interest in war, power, or politics. It is by far one of the best survey courses offered at Yale, and Professor Monteiro is one of Yale's best.",
    "Balance of Power is a truly fantastic class that teaches you so much about world history and politics over the last century. While not at all a history class, it links theory and historical facts quite seamlessly and creates a wonderful academic experience. Professor Monteiro is hilarious and each lecture is a real joy to listen to. The readings are ridiculously long but thankfully they don't seem to be quite necessary for the examinations. Lightly skimming over them is more than enough to do well. And even if one doesn't do well, the class is worth taking anyway."
