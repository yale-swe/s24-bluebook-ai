   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write more strongly and effectively, to better organize my thoughts on paper, and many techniques when it comes to argumentative writing.",
    "I honed my close-reading skills as well as the skills necessary to write a \"college-level\" paper. These range from using Chicago citations correctly to learning how to write a paper where each paragraph builds on the previous one and doesn't just add clutter.",
    "I learned not only a lot about the dynamics between love and power in many different texts and types of texts, but i also learned a lot about my own writing. I think the most valuable part of this course for me was learning more about my own writing style and tendencies.",
    "This class taught me how to analyze a text, come up with my confusions or questions with a text, address these with further analysis and research, outline an essay expressing my response to the original question, writing an essay on my response, and how to critically edit my work and proofread for clarity and good content. I learned a lot about the ways in which different cultures in different time periods thought about love and power and expressed their opinions about love and its relationship with power. This course also taught me how to notice these characteristics in and analyze modern culture for the beliefs about love, power, and other abstract ideas. The due dates were spread out reasonably and the readings as well, I rarely felt overwhelmed by the work in the class, and was usually able to space things out to do them comfortably.",
    "I learned to communicate in a small class, and express my individual thoughts with more confidence."

   "comments": [
    "Some strengths were the attention to the analysis of the texts we read, and the peer review sessions that were used to see how other students were doing. A weakness was a got a little boring with constant analysis, when maybe we could have mixed it up from day to day.",
    "This class is really strong at developing close reading skills and translating that into a paper.",
    "The strengths of this course was the texts we read, which spanned a variety of locations, cultures, and time periods. Ms. Rush was also an amazing teacher, and the analysis she brought to the table spurred conversation and gave us a lot to think about. The weakness of this course was a lack of participation from students. There were only 7 students in the class and often it felt like not all of them were invested in the conversation, but when they did share they gave insightful analyses and really added to the conversation. The only thing that could have made the course better was if the students had participated more, but I think that was not something that could have been changed."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would",
    "I would recommend this course because it doesn't just focus on writing good papers. I think the fact that we read novels and literature had a great\/positive impact on my writing style as well as the breadth and depth of the course. It's the best of both worlds.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class for freshman looking for an english class that will help them develop their reading and writing skills quickly.",
    "I shopped many English 114 and 115 classes, and I settled on this one because, though I wasn't sure it was my favorite content-wise, I loved the professor and I felt that I would learn a lot from her. I loved the class because I really enjoy literature and felt that it was easier to get into, personally, than nonfiction. If someone else has the same preferences as me, I would recommend what I did, but honestly the other courses I shopped were really excellent and you can't really go wrong."
