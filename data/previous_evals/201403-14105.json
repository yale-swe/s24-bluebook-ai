    "This is an excellent course regardless of major. For the humanities or social science focused, it is applicable to both. For STEM majors like me, it provided fascinating insight into a totally new field. Of all my classes this semester, I probably learned the most (actually applicable in real life, that I won't forget by next semester) in this class. The readings were interesting and well selected, and each introduced me to a new way of thinking. Class was always engaging- don't be deterred by the 2 hour time slot once a week. Whether for a major, a distributional requirement, or just general interest, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Iconic material culture is a great class -- 1st half = sociological\/aesthetic theory, 2nd half = empirical studies of how we (U.S.\/the West) interact with our material world. Look at the syllabus -- some pretty fun, fascinating readings! Ethnographies, cultural histories, etc. Prof. Alexander is a really intelligent guy and fairly friendly. He's not the best leader of class discussion so you ought to hope you get a good group of classmates who do the readings and are willing to really keep discussion at a high level. I would say overall, take this course. You will look at the world in a new way!",
    "Alexanders a big figure in the field of cultural sociology, which is too complicated to explain here (see his Wikipedia page). In this particular course and his work, his thesis is that the sacred, myths, and narratives, and iconic symbols havent disappeared in the course of modernization. Durkheims Elementary Forms of Religious Life is the progenitor of this though; Durkheim went into aboriginal societies, and explained the importance of totems, sacred objects which symbolize important values and connect actors to the life of the collective. Alexander shows how modern societies are ripe with such sacred objects, which he calls iconic, and all of their actors have an iconic consciousness. He draws on other aestheticians and sociologists to question the importance of the actual formal characteristics of the object are in determining what meanings they can and do carry. This is a central question for visual artists, and the class was full of graduate students of art (though he will make a different section for grads if lots show up). If you like Roland Barthes Mythologies, this is a good course for you. More practically, if youre interested in advertisement, this class could interest you. The class is divided into two parts, the first covers theory, and the second, applications (definitely see syllabus). The final paper is an original application of iconic theory on a topic of your choosing, based on your own research. You can have fun with this. I wrote on the film Spring Breakers. Alexanders a strong seminar leader. He doesnt want to lecture, but he will keep explaining until the class has a strong enough hold to take things on themselves. He has taken a long time developing a way of approaching the material world, and as an artist, I respect his keen attention to aesthetic details and sensory experience. This is not common in academia, outside of the strict humanities. The beauty of his field is that its so relevant to daily life; he has a framework for understanding every icon, which includes commodities, as well as social figures, i.e. politicians and celebrities. He really wants for you to learn from him, and to take on his particular approach to analyzing culture. Highly recommended you do so."
