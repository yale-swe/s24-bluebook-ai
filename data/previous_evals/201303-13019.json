    "Intro to the immune system.",
    "Yes. It is a very insightful course where you will not only learn the basic biology behind our immune system but will understand the importance and significance as well. While many details were overlooked in areas, this was more than made up for by the wonderful thoughts and commentary that the lecturers shed on the subjects.",
    "An introduction (but in-depth at times) to immunology. I would recommend this course to a fellow student",
    "Yes, I will strongly recommend this course. It helps us to get a whole picture of immune system, which is very helpful for my research.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students who wish to study or work in the immunology field.",
    "Covers the basics of immunology. Yes.",
    "good course for intro immunology",
    "This course is both proper for undergraduate student and graduate student because it gives a overview of how mammal immune system works. I'll recommend this course to another student who is interested in but a new learner of immunology because this course might not give too much detailed information but it is thought-provoking."

    "To understand the innate responses to microbial factors",
    "My past immunology course was of similar scope and difficulty, however it was tought by 1 professor, hadmore details to memorize for exams, and came no where close to this course in terms of thought provoking ideas and insight. Having so many minds within the department here teaching their respective areas of expertise made for a dynamic and exciting course overall.",
    "Extremely helpful to give me a base knowledge of the field of immunology. Will benefit me for my dissertation research.",
    "Very helpful to my research.",
    "This course definitely deepen my knowledge of my discipline because immunology is also important for microbial pathogenesis. This course inspired my interests in immunology and broaden my horizon. It also introduced me to some new techniques which are important for my future research."
