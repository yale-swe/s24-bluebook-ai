    "yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Rogers encouraged us to play to our strengths. Students from every literary period were in our class, and I really think the course was all the better for it.",
    "\"Milton\" is a fantastic course, and if Professor Rogers is teaching it again, I would heavily recommend it. I had no experience with \"Milton\" before taking the course--in fact, I had not even taken \"Major English Poets\"--and was for the most part a student of the later Modern period, but I still found myself perfectly at ease with the course material and consistently excited by class discussions. Professor Rogers makes difficult material not only accessible but desirable. There are also few settings in which one is able to read Paradise Lost over the course of eight weeks (counting Spring Break), and that alone is reason enough to take the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course didn't deepen my knowledge of *my* field, but it was still very productive. It helped me clarify some of my broader interests that I hope now to take back to my own field in useful ways.",
    "As an undergraduate student, it might be that this question is not intended for me, but I will answer anyway. I was writing a senior thesis on forms of paradise in a 20th Latin American novel with little to no influence by Milton, so besides an opportunity to engage in a deeper conceptual exploration of the idea of paradise and its roots and discontents, the course did not directly interact with my thesis research. It did, however, significantly deepen my understanding of the discipline of literary criticism, as almost every week class discussions circled not only on the content of the secondary material but on the very fundamental question of why it is worth doing literary criticism at all. Why, in other words, do we still talk about Milton, long after anything new, presumably, has been said about him? The answer was not something related to the inherent greatness or timelessness of his verse, but was a more complicated engagement with the question of literary critical responsibility, and it was a refreshing, vital, and extremely necessary semester-long discussion."
