   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was interesting and that it taught a lot of good information about the history of Latin America and the United States. I thought one of its weaknesses was that although it had no prerequisites, in many cases it seemed as if all of the students were expected to have a very good knowledge of Latin American history already. One of its strengths was that having two teachers who specialized in different topics was very effective. I would recommend this class to another student if he had a strong interest in Latin American history.",
    "This class was awesome... challenging, not in the (highly reasonable) workload, but in the breadth of the course content. The professors are amazing and clearly love what they teach.",
    "Hist 007 is a great exploration of the lesser known history of the relationship between the United States and Latin America. It covers a large time period and a great many angles of looking at history. The professors are really nice and engaging people and the workload isn't too bad if you don't mind a lot of reading. It might make you rethink a lot of what you thought you knew about US history and it will certainly help you learn about the American psyche in international relations. I really recommend it if you get the chance, because I really enjoyed it.",
    "Yes, recommended for freshman and history buffs.",
    "Fantastic course that changes the way you think about history. We look at how power shapes the way history is constructed - for instance the way the Haitian revolution is silenced from historical narratives despite its immense significance as the first slave revolution - and also look at how people in the U.S. and people in Latin America can perceive the same events really differently. Professor Van Vleck and Professor Jardno do a great job of facilitating sparkling discussions that help us look at history from both perspectives.",
    "I'm honestly saddened no further classes of freshmen will get the opportunity to take this course. The workload was so perfect, the readings so interesting and so well-chosen, the discussions so intriguing - there's very little I can say in the negative about Intro to US-L.A. relations. Every reading we were given showed me totally new things I thought I had fully covered about Latin America, and although I was a little startled at first by their specificity (the whitewashing of Los Angeles, for example) I quickly came to enjoy that style. Wholeheartedly engaged by this course. Both professors had a wonderful teaching style and the two combined together made for an absolutely enthralling experience.",
    "This class is great! The professors made it very straightforward yet interesting. So many new topics are covered in a variety of ways that make the class very enjoyable. A great class for anyone interested in the less talked about aspects of US history.",
    "Any with an interest in U.S foreign relations or Latin American history should take this class.",
    "The professors are not to be missed and the readings are rad (in a very literal sense). Take it, take it, take it!",
    "More than 200 years of transcontinental history covered in a semester. This course will not only change the way in which you view US-Latin American relations, but also how you view the discipline of history in general.",
    "[TL;DR] HIST 007 is awesome! Take it if you want a wide approach to the U.S.-Latin America relations during the twentieth-century. The grading is reasonable (one midterm paper and one final paper), the readings are mostly exciting, and in the end of the term you will understand much more of these relations than you did before the course started. HIST 007 was a wonderful seminar! I wanted a Humanities course to avoid the STEM-y semester, and I really appreciated finding a course that related many features that were appealing to me: U.S. and Latin America (being international, I found this twice as attractive, for it presented the U.S. and its relations to foreign countries); both cultural and political approaches to History (I particularly enjoyed this more holistic approach to these studies); the reasonable demand on readings (it was the perfect balance for me to get used to College-level readings in Humanities classes) and assignments (the two papers allowed me to practice formal writing techniques while doing my own primary source-based research); and many more. *CLASSES AND READINGS We met twice a week for one-hour long discussions of the readings. The readings averaged 150 pages per week, and presented many approaches to the topics of each week, including cultural and economic arguments. The content of the readings would always bring exciting discussions upon us, and the relaxed environment of the class allowed the students to present facts, comments, arguments and opinions easily an promptly. *ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING The grading consists of one map quiz, one midterm paper and one final paper. The map quiz as not a challenge, and one should not worry about it. The midterm paper is an academic review of a text that we had read for the class. The final paper was a research-based project, in which the students should consider primary sources to understand some historical event\/period that related to their own interests and the class itself. Alternatively, one could produce a podcast talking about some topic (with the same, or even more, work and research). The grading was strict in a constructive way, and one should not avoid the class if worried about it. *OVERALL It is a wonderful course, and I totally recommend it.",
    "A great freshman seminar! Both Professor Van Vleck and Professor Jardno were engaging in class and extremely helpful during office hours. I not only learned a lot about the topics we discussed, but also, history in the academic world and a historian's process. My only complaint is that I wish I had more time to finish all the reading. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this course and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is already interested in the subject or someone who never enjoyed history in high school."
