   "comments": [
    "Recommended to anyone interested in archaeology and\/or this part of the world. We focused mainly on the Neolithic and Bronze Periods and examined a lot of archaeological reports. The workload was reasonable, and consisted of two 6-8pages papers and a take home final. Professor Underhill was fantastic, easily one of my new favorite teachers at Yale. You can really tell she loves this subject and her enthusiasm is refreshing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class! It's a low-stress class - you can take your time on the three papers and take home test. The topics are pretty straightforward.",
    "I would recommend Chinese Archaeology to students who already have a vested interest in China. Though I'm a Chinese literature major, the course unexpectedly ended up expanding my understanding of Chinese history and art. An excellent way to fulfill an So requirement for a humanities major interested in East Asia.",
    "Great course to take if you are interested in gaining insight about early Chinese civilizations that are infrequently covered in archaeology survey courses. Great too if you want to complement historical knowledge of Chinese culture with physical archaeology. Professor Underhill's very knowledgable and approachable!",
    "It was a fascinating and informative class. I would definitely recommend it if you have any interest at all in the subject matter.",
    "I would describe Archaeological Studies 215 as an interesting foray into the archaeology of Ancient China, and would recommend the course to a fellow student if he\/she has any interest in China, East Asia, or archaeology, because the material is pretty interesting.",
    "Take this class. You won't regret it. If you are even slightly interested in anthropology and archaeology and you would like to get a good taste of it, this is your chance."
