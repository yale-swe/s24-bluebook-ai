   "comments": [
    "It doesn't require much work, and if you're interested in sociology, it's a good freshman seminar to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student who is interested in sociology. The work load is a fair amount, but definitely manageable. The only assignments except for reading and posting comments are two papers. Then there is also the midterm and final (where he gives you samples that are pretty similar).",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are looking for a nice seminar that will challenge them and force them to think creatively. There is a heavy workload, but the material is interesting and covers stuff that most kids have not had exposure to (in depth) in high school classes.",
    "This class is the BEST class I took in the fall semester of my freshman year. There are many readings, but they are usually very interesting. Professor Smith expects a lot from students, so be ready to work hard. You have midterm and final exams as well as a book review and a final paper. This class will help you develop critical thinking and writing skills that will be fundamental during your years at Yale.",
    "An interesting class of about average difficulty. As a freshman, this class is so helpful in preparing you for the next 4 years, for it hits pretty much everything you'll be doing: discussions, lectures, big research papers, small papers, online posting, various types of readings. I would highly recommend it to anyone!",
    "Yes. I am not planning on majoring in this topic, but the course was so, so interesting.",
    "It is a good course, you will learn a lot if you do the readings. You will get from the course what you put into it.",
    "This class is a very interesting one to take, with an amazing professor- seriously, Professor Smith is just an all around awesome guy. Sometimes the readings could be confusing and difficult to follow, but overall the course covered many very interesting topics and it was great to take a small class like this one. One warning- we had a book review and a midterm and then a final paper and a final exam, so just be ready for that. But this class is definitely worth taking.",
    "This class was rarely boring. The topics that we came across were very relevant to modern society even if they were theories that were presented centuries ago. I would recommend this Freshman Seminar as it is a great introduction to college seminars. You learn a great deal but remain engaged throughout the course. There are two papers tied to this course. The first is a book review which I suggest starting as soon as possible. (Also, choose a book that will hold your interest). The second paper is a topic of your choice that must relate to something learned in class. The prof. will help you settle on a final topic, give you tips along the way, and even look at drafts beforehand. The other work associated with this class is mostly reading. After each reading, students were required to post thoughts online."
