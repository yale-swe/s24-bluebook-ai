   "comments": [
    "The good thing about this course is that it forces you to read at least one paper per week. I found that many of the papers and our discussions, however, did not inform my understanding of cell biology. The workload is very light and reasonable. I think changing the format of the discussion and choosing different papers would make this class excellent.",
    "I highly recommend this course to students who want to know the trend of cell biology field and improve their literature reading skills.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to learn about a variety of topics and techniques in cell biology and allows students to discuss and ask questions about the material.",
    "I feel like the class needed a little bit more direction and definition... it was not really a lecture class, and although it was supposed to be a discussion based class, the discussions were more forced and not very thorough. Class could definitely be improved.",
    "Would only recommend to a student who is invested in cell and\/or molecular biology. Students learn primarily from reading primary source documents.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a great overview of current topics of interest in Cell Biology.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone looking for a seminar in cell biology."

   "comments": [
    "I learned about a few more current areas of research and learned about some microscopy techniques. However, we did not learn about them enough to be able to really say I have knowledge of them. This course was useful in giving me more background of the literature but overall I did not learn as much as I expected to learn.",
    "It is very helpful. Though my research is not directly related with the course but it help me to know more about cell biology which is the fundamental part for all research.",
    "It provided a nice overview of the field",
    "The course provided experience in evaluating the scientific literature necessary for my success as a scientists and covered a number of cell biological phenomena."
