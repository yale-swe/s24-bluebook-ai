    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It provided a mix of relevant readings and sociological methodology that was extremely helpful and engaging.",
    "General introduction into gender theory, followed with a selection of recent sociology works on gender.",
    "The sociology of sex & gender is a broad and deep dive into the sociological research on the aforementioned subsection of sociology. I would tell a fellow student, \"Take this class, regardless of if you think you are interested in sex, gender, or qualitative methods. You will gain much even if you think your work is unrelated.\" I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in gender and sexuality studies. It is also useful for students who are completely new to this area, and Rene is open to all levels of experience and interest! Students will definitely benefit from Rene's teaching and the readings and discussions in the course!"

   "comments": [
    "I had some background in sex & gender theory before taking this class. However, I know far more now and feel much more confident in my ability to speak clearly and incorporate sex & gender theory into my work. Plus, the mini-lectures about navigating graduate school were incredibly helpful.",
    "This course helped me with professionalization a lot, and Rene was incredibly generous with her time and in listening to our ideas about what we wanted to learn in this respect. She also helped me with my dissertation\/research through her own work and in the time she spent helping us think through our ideas!"
