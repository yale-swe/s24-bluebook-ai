    "CHNS 150 is the same Chinese class as always. The volume of work for a semester I found to be a little much to balance. The teachers are great. Everything is predictable and formatted as usual. Take it if you're trying to continue your Chinese learning.",
    "A good way to continue your language study after a summer in China. You aren't really going to learn anything all that new, but CHNS 150 is a good way to consolidate skills, especially writing.",
    "The class is pretty decent, although sometimes there's too much restating stuff from the text and too little adapting the language to different circumstances. Also, the textbook is sort of sexist. However, it's well taught and has a reasonable workload.",
    "I took L3-L4 over the summer, and chances are that people in 150 did the same. The summer class was very reading\/writing-intensive; we learned a lot of grammar structures and vocabulary that wasn't necessarily useful in everyday life. But with 150, we studied a lot more common phrases that we could actually use in day-to-day conversation, and I think that this emphasis of speaking abilities is where the real value of the course lies. So if you want to improve your speaking, take 150, although in my year there were too many people and in-class practice was not enough. Take time with your tutor and your native-speaker friends.",
    "I would recommend it, as it is a great way to expand on our knowledge of Chinese at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Your language skills will improve.",
    "If you are committed to learning Chinese, definitely take this class. The workload is fairly heavy and you must have a real desire to improve in order to enjoy this class. However, your Chinese will definitely improve.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to continue improving your Chinese (especially if you did Light). That being said, be prepared to put in a lot of time and work; I would suggest going to office hours and Chinese table whenever possible to further reinforce your learning."
