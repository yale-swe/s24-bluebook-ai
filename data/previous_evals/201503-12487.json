    "This is a rather difficult course. You should expect to spend on average one and a half hour on it everyday just to keep up with the reading, exercises and practices. Be sure to speak Spanish as much as you can in order not to look dumb in class (and in the final oral evaluation).",
    "It's an introductory spanish class. Take it if you want to start learning spanish.",
    "It's a good introductory Spanish course. Professor Tortora is excellent.",
    "This was a class I really enjoyed. Just do keep in mind that the class does meet 5 times a week and there is homework every night that you have to keep up with to avoid falling behind. Studying every night is important to be successful and actually grasp the language. I would recommend the class.",
    "Definitely take with Tortura",
    "It is an excellent introductory Spanish course which I reccomend to anyone wanting to start learning the language.",
    "Spanish 110 was challenging, but by forcing me to learn the vocabulary and practice on my own I felt that I learned a lot in one semester."
