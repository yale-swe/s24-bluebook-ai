   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in film, filmmaking, or making any sort of art, take this class. Scorsese constantly experiments, constantly pushes himself to make something New, exciting, and challenging. Yet there is a deep respect for and exploration of his roots, the Italian-American community in New York, that can be traced throughout his body of work. It's exciting to unpack the journey of this American artist and revel in the depth, detail, and surprise embedded in each of his films.",
    "Take this class. It will be the highlight of your week. There isn't too much work and the subject material is fun and interesting.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Professor Kerbel is the sweetest, and he is so genuinely interested in Scorsese's work that it makes class a pleasure to attend. He is very approachable and kind, and does a great job facilitating and encouraging group discussion. The subject matter of the course is also fantastic I had only seen a couple Scorsese films before this class, but now I have a real appreciation for Scorsese's work and understand his significance as an American filmmaker. This was my favorite class this semester, and maybe even in my time at Yale.",
    "Take this class 100% if you can get in.",
    "If you want to learn in-depth about the films of one of the best living American filmmakers, take this course.",
    "Very seldom does one have an opportunity to watch so many films by one auteur chronologically and in such an engaging settinga worthwhile exercise, even if it wasn't a filmmaker as influential and bold as Scorsese. Absolutely recommended!",
    "If you can get in, ABSOLUTELY take it. It was my favorite course this semester hands down and one of my favorite at Yale thus far. So thought provoking, engaging, a great exercise for analysis AND fun.",
    "Scorsese in chronological ordertake it!"
