   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this class. The workload is quite light, one group presentation\/short midterm paper, a final paper, and some in-class discussion leadership. The reading is interesting and covers a myriad of topic areas. The best part of the class is Professor Greenberg. He is accessible, hilarious, and well-informed and keeps the class engaged in a way very few professors at Yale do.",
    "A really interesting, and really fun class! Take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Languages and Politics to another student. It is a great political science seminar and a great way to get a feel for the linguistic issues going on around the world.",
    "Yes TAKE IT if you can get in!",
    "Take this class if you can get in. Its really terrific. Manageable workload, awesome professor, good discussions.",
    "Yeah I would, Greenberg is great, the class is interesting.",
    "Not a lot of work and very interesting material, especially for those who speak multiple languages. Greenberg is a really caring and smart professor--all-around great guy.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Yes. It's a really interesting topic and the professor is amazing. Not too much work and very enjoyable.",
    "Yes I would recommend it",
    "This was, without a doubt, among the best taught, most stimulating and genuinely fascinating classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Greenberg came enthusiastically prepared each week to teach about language issues around the world. His approach in class and the readings assigned focused on case-studies which as very effective and allowed us to see how language policies--which can often be theoretical and abstract--affect people and societies. The midterm project allowed us to learn about a place in the world that was unfamiliar to us and collaborate with a group to deliver a presentation to class and write up individual components. The final, on the other hand, allowed us to explore topics of individual interest in considerable depth.",
    "TAKE TAKE TAKE. The readings are light and the grading is pretty easy and it is extremely interesting. You will never be bored in class!",
    "This course provides an interesting array of examples from around the world and within the U.S. (and this semester, even in New Haven) of how language policy is influenced by politics, history, and public opinion. I absolutely recommend this class. Professor Greenberg knows a lot about the subject, and he does a great job of making the course enjoyable.",
    "definitely take it. good class, manageable reading, learned a lot."
