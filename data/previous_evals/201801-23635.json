   "comments": [
    "Developed the skills to think about\/ analyze economic phenomena using sociological theories.",
    "I gained a greater background on sociological concepts which helped me examine the market and global economy from a completely new perspective. I was also able to increase my writing ability and learned a new form of writing which will greatly prepare me for writing my senior thesis.",
    "As a non-sociology major, I learnt a lot about some of the core concepts in sociology. I also learnt a lot about analyzing markets from a sociological, and not economic perspective: for example thinking about where does value of a good come from, embeddedness and so on.",
    "I learned a lot about markets and their intricate evolutions. Most importantly though, I learned to look with a sociologists eye, carefully and critically at social equity for a inherently unequal system.",
    "This was an incredible class! It was perfect for both majors and non-majors. Class discussions were interesting and engaging.",
    "I learned a lot about market dynamics and connected both sociology and economics using pertinent theories as well as research papers as examples.",
    "Learned about a broad spectrum of markets and how they interplay",
    "This was a wonderful course that changed the way I took at markets, which are ubiquitous in our lives but we never think much of them. It truly makes you think about a lot of the things we take for granted, such as how value is assigned to certain things.",
    "i learned a lot about how sociology interacts with economics and different markets, along with the multiple players in the said markets",
    "Understood betterhow market functions. Gained insight into the social aspect of markets.",
    "I learned a lot about the sociological backings of a lot of core economic concepts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It could be helpful to have comprehensive notes or slideshow\/powerpoints about the large ideas discussed regarding the readings. This would be especially helpful given that the seminar only meets once a week--I think having these notes would be a great way to keep the class more engaged with this course throughout the week.",
    "Really good class! The discussions were well moderated and class was always fun.",
    "The professor was amazing and really cared about her students. The readings were also very interesting and the seminar was moderated well. No weaknesses.",
    "I loved how this course was set up... I felt like I was able to learn a lot in the class discussions and really enjoyed the content. The only thing I would have changed was the length of readings. I know with a seminar there is typically much more reading but I often felt like it was unmanageable. It was doable given the strength of in class discussions and when there was something I did not have time to comprehend, someone in the class was able to share their insight.",
    "More explanations of background concepts for those less experienced in the material",
    "I liked how each week was organized by topic, and the order of the topics made a lot of sense. I also appreciated that we were able to discuss in class the questions we had posted about the readings. I also enjoyed that there were so many group activities to apply the knowledge we had! I wished that there was more guidance on the readings (which Professor Luo did do earlier in the semester by briefly introducing the readings but stopped halfway) because some of them were really hard to follow.",
    "professor luo is an amazing professor - i would just suggest that in the future, the classes be smaller\/more seminar style",
    "Strengths: The class has a structure that is very conducive to student learning. The discussion board every week encourages students to do all the readings. Lectures, discussion accompanied by in class activities really help students to approach every weeks topics in a myriad of interesting ways Weakness: I wish class discussions are more guided. Now I feel every one has their own opinion, and the professor is too nice to point out who is correct and who is not.",
    "I think as a strength, Professor Luo and Till are a great duo and work well together. However, I think that seminar sometimes was too structured: Professor Luo would always have a powerpoint ready with specific questions we were to answer in discussion. I think the seminar would have flowed much better if we were simply allowed to discuss the readings and our reactions without much guidance. Also, the readings were quite dry for about a third of the seminar - I wish there were more interesting readings or case studies.",
    "great use of in class group work activities to illustrate key concepts in class"

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend. It was very interesting and not too stressful, can learn to think about everyday things in new perspectives.",
    "Yes I would most definitely recommend this course to another student because it covers helpful properties that could benefit any student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course as its an interesting as well as essential perspective as we move toward taking critical jobs in these said markets.",
    "Yes definitely!!!! This class is a gem.",
    "Yes I really liked this course and the prof\/TA. The course was the perfect crossover between economics and sociology and gave me the opportunity to learn about and analyze markets from a sociological perspective (which economics typically ignores).",
    "Yes, its a challenging but rewarding seminar and the professor and ta really just wanted to help",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other students! The readings are so, so fascinating and the workload is super manageable.",
    "yes! i loved this class",
    "Would recommend this course to econs students who hope to understand the social aspects of markets. Wouldnt recommend to sociology students who want to understand markets, because it would be a little bit easy",
    "If you're not a sociology major and just taking this for the writing credit, as I was, there are better options to get the WR. Don't let the \"Markets\" in the name fool you: do not take this if you're an econ major and hoping to learn a cool topic in economics, this is purely a sociology course and is mostly sociology students. In fact, I'd argue you don't even need introductory econ to take this. The readings most weeks were incredibly bland and dry. Seminar also was not great, it was the same 4-5 students (especially the MBA students!!!) dominating the conversation. I think moving forward there needs to be a way to restrict this class to undergrads because I think the presence of MBA students wasn't great for the atmosphere in the class.",
    "yes - a fascinating survey of different perspectives on how markets develop and operate",
    "Yep!"
