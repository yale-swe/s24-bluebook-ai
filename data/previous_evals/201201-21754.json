    "This was a fantastic class! If you're interested in the implications and themes that arise from WWII and its aftermath, then take it! That being said, this course won't give you a comprehensive historic view, as it's more focused on different ideas and the cultural history\/legacy of the war, each week looking at a different theme. Professor Van Vleck is wonderful- skilled at guiding discussion, understanding, and always contactable. She was great as a teacher of more than the material, helping with the skills necessary to go about a primary research-based paper; one class was devoted to a library tutorial, and I now feel comfortable with many of the resources available here (Beinecke, Manuscripts& Archives, the online systems). She also set deadlines for the final paper throughout the term, which might seem annoying, but will save you from an all-nighter or two at the end, and her feedback on the draft was incredibly helpful. As a sophomore, I found her skills-focused approach really helpful, and I just really enjoyed the seminar. Take it!",
    "This course is primarily about historiography, and understanding historical scholarship over major themes\/issues. It helps students understand how we remember the war and the significance of war in itself and in relation to later day events. It exposes students to a diverse range of arguments. Students also have the chance to read hand-in-hand several primary source and secondary source to gain a fuller and more comprehensive view of historical context. I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Van Vleck conducts the class very effectively and discussions were extremely thought-provoking and smooth, in part because she really knew how to facilitate discussion and throw in interesting questions. Great reading materials, great discussion topics, great primary sources, and a professor who is always well -prepared, well organized, articulate, and on top of the class materials. Take it.PS: The workload is not terrible ,but be prepared to work. Expect also a fair amount (150 pages or more) of reading every week. One mid-term paper assignment, a weekly response, a presentation, and a final research paper. It's spaced out and cumulative, and gives students ample time to prepare for each task.",
    "Good seminar, definitely recommend it for anyone interested in WWII. I had a great time taking it.",
    "Really interesting class, especially if you've never been exposed to cultural history. Professor Van Vleck is great!",
    "World War Two and Its Legacies is a fantastic course if you're interested in evaluating lots of primary sources and historiography. Keep in mind that this is an Amero-centric course and focusses almost entirely on the war's legacies in the United States.Professor Van Vleck leads an excellent discussion. She lets her students take the seminar where they see fit but has a tremendous depth of knowledge to contribute, where ever the discussion goes.",
    "Excellent course in every respect. Brilliant, astute professor - committed, engaged, impressive. Take it!",
    "This is definitely a junior history seminar, meaning that you wont really learn much about actual events as much as you'll learn about how to do history. As long as that's what you're looking for, the class was great.",
    "Yes"
