    "There were three homework assignments - those probably took me about four-five hours each, but they were just a one sitting type assignment. The group projects are a lot of work (there are two). For the paper discussion project, we met two or three times for threeish hours each. For the final project, we met a lot, maybe five times? and we spent a lot of time together working on it, probably like four hour chunks of time.",

   "comments": [
    "Great course, covers a range of surveillance topics and methods and the material is well presented throughout. The homework is applied as well as the final project\/paper. I thought maybe there could be a couple more methods taught, the course was slow to pick up the first few weeks, so maybe fill in that time with more coding classes.",
    "Pretty good survey course of surveillance. Not terribly heavy on methods, even though that is Prof. Weinberger's forte. Also rather hard to teach the concepts and execution of the methods simultaneously. Pretty hard to keep up with the on screen coding while trying to conceptually comprehend the material as well. I liked how multiple vantage points of surveillance including ethics were covered. I felt like the in-class period to work on the presentations was sort of a waste and we would have better benefited from a scheduled meeting with the TF and\/or Prof. Weinberger as needed.",
    "I think the class was a good taste of some quantitative methods you can use for modeling and presenting surveillance data. I remember Dan began the semester and said \"this is not a methods course,\" but I thought it certainly presented flavors of many methods you would use to model surveillance data, and you use SAS\/R once a week. So I did not find that statement particularly accurate. Therefore, I found the focus of this course kind of confusing. Some lectures were modeling focused, some were application focused, some were a broad overview of surveillance data, but all of these lectures were scattered together. I think all of those things are important to talk about, but I think the progression of topics could be improved. It also wasn't obvious to me what the course would be like by the name and description of the course. This class, to me, was what you made of it. I liked that Dan provided the option to go more into depth on some methods if you were in the modeling track or if you were a PhD student. But he also catered to those of us with less of a modeling background who just wanted a nice intro. I also wish we had covered other types of surveillance, like vector surveillance.",
    "I liked being able to explore methods used in the class on the final project.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. I especially liked the methods focus, although the methods lectures themselves were sometimes hard to follow completely and made more sense through lab and homework. I liked the case studies and all the guest speakers. The final project was a lot of work but I learned a lot so it was definitely worthwhile.",
    "This was a great introduction course. I wish there were a similar class that is more advanced so that we could go more into depth and have more opportunities to apply what we learned.",
    "This class absolutely delivered as an introduction to surveillance thinking. Lectures were engaging, fun, and interesting, and students were given opportunities to participate in many different ways, from class discussions to group presentations. I really enjoyed the diverse nature of the course, as it ranged from DPH guest lectures to trying out health surveys, from discussing ethics of surveillance systems to hearing presentations on some of the newest analytic techniques from our peers. The methods built nicely on one another over the course of the semester, even though the topics (i.e. diseases) generally varied from week to week. This keep the course manageable (there was never a point where students no longer understood what was going on in terms of analytic methods) but stimulating each week. I have two comments for areas of improvement. The first is more of a personal preference: While I understand\/appreciate that Dan wanted to teach things for which he has experience, I would have liked a larger focus on the development of effective surveillance systems (I initially thought this was going to be a central focus of the class). For example, throughout the course, we learned about limitations of data that comes from surveillance systems, and it would be great to have a lecture where, perhaps, we apply this knowledge to learn ways to create\/improve existing surveillance systems. Also, after discussing with other class members, it seems that students got the most out of the material through the homeworks. I think it would be reasonable to do a few extra shorter assignments so that students can expand this learning-by-doing to cover more of the course material, and also review homework problems that students struggled with."

    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Prof. Weinberger is awesome. He's very enthusiastic about the material and that comes through. He tries hard to explain things as best possible and is willing to help outside of the class as well. A great professor.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Really caring for students and provides quick responses. Brilliant with coding and analyses, fairly engaging with students. I would have liked to have received more critical feedback from Prof. Weinberger regarding our presentations, beyond a question verbalized question or two. I feel like for the amount of time and effort we put in, we should have received a written evaluation, possibly in the form of a rubric, but something which covered strengthens and weaknesses of the presentation. It would be helpful to have a written grade on these assignments as well.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was always really responsive to questions, either in person or by email. He was clearly engaged with the class, and always wanting to improve it. I think he is a really good professor.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan was an incredible instructor who responded well to student engagement, interactions, and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is great! Very knowledgable of the subject and methods, and cared a lot about the class",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Incredibly kind and approachable. Great at explaining class concepts and available to students as a resource",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is a uniquely great teacher. He made every effort to continually engage the class, and valued feedback to ensure we were understanding the material. His humble intelligence translated into creating a true environment of no stupid questions; in other words, students felt comfortable learning and participating without any fear of reproach. Dan held our hands initially through the fundamentals of the course, as we covered time series modeling, in a way that was helpful even for people who have had prior research experience in that area. As we approached more difficult topics, he taught them in a step-by-step and interactive manner that made things digestible, even if students werent fully able to grasp all material. Dan ensured that the material itself covered not only quantitative methods (basic and advanced, e.g. synthetic controls and big data) but also things like ethical and logistical considerations, which are also so important in public health. He was also always kind, encouraging, flexible, and available when students needed assistance."

   "comments": [
    "Great course, definitely something to take if you're interested in any form of surveillance work or statistical analysis. Helpful to take before starting thesis, especially if the thesis has time series data.",
    "Good introduction into public health surveillance!",
    "All EMD students should strongly consider taking this course as surveillance is an integral part of infectious disease epidemiology. Also, there is a lot of discussion and learning that made the overall experience very worthwhile.",
    "This course was a great introduction to surveillance systems\/analysis. Each week covered a new topic and\/or analytic method with one lecture and corresponding lab. Lectures were interesting and engaging, and labs (and especially related homeworks) were good opportunities to apply what wed learned. The class also covered applications\/adaptations of the classic surveillance system to many diverse settings, via lectures and class presentations. Throughout, the workload is less than other similar classes, yet there are a few times where it is easy to go above basic expectations and students are more likely to do so because they are given freedom to choose topics\/methods that interest them. Would definitely recommend to others."
