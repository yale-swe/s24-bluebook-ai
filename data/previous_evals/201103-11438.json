    "If Mark is teaching it, take it. But only if your chemistry skills aren't rusty. It had been two whole years since I had touched the subject, so I straggled behind with the basics. Other than that, if you're into it, go for it. Pretty straight forward: weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final.",
    "it was good to get an overall summary of the ocean\/earth geochem system, but it lacked consistency and there was no text book. also notes were incredibly difficult to take because pagani was very lazy",
    "I liked the subject matter, though at times pretty boring. I really enjoyed Pagani's lectures and sense of humor; he enjoyed bashing religion and global warming skeptics. He's pretty apathetic about teaching, but he got me excited about geochem, and I'm not even a G&G major.",
    "Geochemistry is a tough class with difficult problem sets and tests. Although previous chemistry and physics knowledge is required and useful, topics covered in this class are difficult when applied to geological contexts. That being said, this class is righteous and the ocean-atmosphere systems discussed in the final month of class are unbelievably interesting and important.",
    "Take the class if you are interested in the subject. Don't expect the class to be well organized but if you enjoy learning by having discussions with the professor, his teaching style will work for you."
