   "comments": [
    "I suppose I learned to not be frustrated by among the most frustrating questions I have faced at Yale so far.",
    "A basic understanding of linguistics methodology. A background knowledge of the history of the history of the Voynich manuscript",
    "A lot of basic linguistics as well as interesting facts about the Voynich. Pretty darn cool",
    "This is perhaps the most eclectic course I have ever taken at Yale (and I'm 37 credits deep at this point). The principle focus of the course, and what you will talk about everyday of the semester, is the Voynich Manuscript (VMS). It's an old medieval manuscript full of strange images of plants, stars, people, medicine, and other obscure things. It's written in a language (code? cipher? gibberish? old forgotten language?) that nobody has been able to make even the slightest progress in understanding. Coupled with its strange images, the VMS is the source of many conspiracy theories and has its own cult following on the internet where amateur cryptographers try to crack it. The course is a very in-depth attempt at understanding the VMS like a professional and not a loon on the internet: you will talk about how manuscripts are made, different kinds of ink, medieval history, image comparisons with other manuscripts, cryptography, languages, computational linguistics, encoding and decipherment, medieval medicine, astrology, astronomy, botany, dark magic, spells, and a few dozen theories about the VMS (and why they are all wrong).",
    "Cryptology, Linguistic theory, Codicological studies, Medieval Art History, Astrology, Astronomy, and MORE!! We used the VMS as the basis for the course but approached it through a multi-disciplinary approach that included the above topic to work towards a layered understanding of the Manuscript.",
    "I HAVE GAINED SO MUCH INSIGHT ON THE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT. I BREATHE THE VOYNICH. I DREAM ABOUT THE VOYNICH. I AM, IN FACT, WILFRID VOYNICH. ok but real talk I learned a lot about the history of medieval manuscripts, herbs, basic linguistics and computational models related to that, and astrology. You basically learn a hodge-podge of random things that are necessary to jumpstart your ability to analyze a manuscript that no one's been able solve for hundreds of years - a good survey of all topics, but nothing in depth. The only in depth thing you will encounter are the convoluted analyses of Voynich crazies on page 6 of a thread you find on page 3 of google search - all in all, still good.",
    "Learned a lot about the Voynich Manuscript, and various medieval manuscripts.",
    "This class was an apt introduction to cryptography and medieval literary\/bookmaking practices. By taking this course, which obviously focused heavily on the Voynich Manuscript in particular, I was able to gain insights into the aforementioned fields, as well as the process of decryption and the statistical methodologies associated with decryption.",
    "Firstly, I learned about basic linguistic principles, ciphers, properties of conlangs, and the medieval culture of astrology, alchemy, and botany. Further, I also gained further skills in tackling a problem, and conducting an investigation where the data would not necessarily give a clear outcome.",
    "This course was really interesting in that it has a very unconventional setup- it is highly interactive\/research based. I entered this course knowing nothing about the Voynich Manuscript and left with knowledge of many theories about what it might be, statistical insights, linguistic analysis, and thorough exposure to the breadth of questions surrounding this curious work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Interesting guest lecturers and clear depth of understanding from Prof Bowern. Weakness: Disorganized throughout. The final paper is ten pages but at 1.5 spacing which is really weird and annoying. Like just tell us to write a longer paper double spaced so we don't have that moment where we realize we have to write a longer paper than we thought. Truly sucks the joy out of my life.",
    "Many of the assignments didn't relate much to Voynich manuscript and we weren't well notified about having them in the first place.",
    "Great discussion and the topic is great. Sometimes gets a little dry but overall great",
    "The strengths of the course are the instructor (Dr. Bowern) and the eclectic course material. Dr. Bowern is such a lovely and quirky teacher. She is very passionate about linguistics and about the VMS and is perhaps the only sane person alive who is studying it. She has a very interesting perspective and is well-studied in not only linguistics but also in many of the strange aspects of the course, such as botany, medieval astrology, and ink making. She brings this passion and wide array of expertise into the course outline and really guides you through every possible aspect of the VMS, from its history to its craftsmanship to its ominous images and text. She invited some cool guest lecturers and got us to see the actual VMS (which is in the Beinecke) as well as a few other manuscripts at the Cushing center in the medical library. The weaknesses of the course are the lack of structure, lack of grading transparency, and repetitiveness of content. The course started off pretty well organized but pretty quickly devolved into a weekly 'here's a theory, here's why its obviously wrong' and by the middle of the semester it became evident (spoilers) that the VMS so obscure that its beyond solving at this point. I could basically tell you why any theory is wrong based just off of the conclusion without even reading it at this point. I wish we would have spent some time stepping away from the VMS and learned more about cryptography. There was like one lecture on it but I would have loved a more advanced treatment of it. Also, this is one of those courses where there is no outline of how grades are assigned and that you have no idea how you are doing in until you get a letter grade on your transcript at the end of the semester. More transparency in grading (and more concrete rubrics) would be nice.",
    "Strengths: The material is fascinating, and there is always so much to uncover about the VMS, and Professor Bowern does a wonderful job of trying to reach every topic, as well as bringing in outside support (guest lectures) to aid in subjects she is not herself an expert in, Weaknesses: Shaped by the class make-up, the levels of engagement vary among the students present",
    "I think this class, in its current form, is more suited for being a lecture rather than seminar. If this class is kept seminar style, I would highly suggest having more visits to the Beinecke or Cushing libraries to look at manuscripts, or having student-given presentations (every other week or so?) to keep people engaged and up to date on the Voynich and what we're learning. Some classes got too off topic and wonky and those got a bit borning because specific people would dominate the class narrative. The strengths were definitely Prof. Bowern's enthusiasm and depth of knowledge, as well as the guest lectures!!",
    "I really enjoyed the fusion of lecture and seminar style teaching methods this class employed. This mix facilitated student learning very well.",
    "A strength of the course was definitely the small class size that facilitated active group discussions and engaging group work.",
    "Awesome class, very free form which I think is great because the class was tailored to explore our groups particular interests as we went along. Not much is known about the manuscript so it was really fun to take a class which was more about discovery than about learning established knowledge."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I mean it's a frustrating course with no clear takeaway, but the workload isn't too bad (apart from a 10 page 1.5 spaced paper (which is an annoying spacing)). Otherwise there are a few short papers throughout but they are manageable.",
    "I really wanted to like this class. The concept is great, and Claire is a wonderful professor and person who so obviously exudes passion about linguistics, old manuscripts, and the Voynich. Unfortunately, the subject just isn't conducive to being the focus of discussion for an entire semester. It became clear after about a month that the class would be going in circles: either superficially introducing some new statistical technique to crack ciphers and showing that it isn't revealing when applied to the Voynich, or expounding for an hour about some strange aspect of medieval magic\/astrology\/religion that generally has a tenuous connection to the contents of the manuscript. If the class spent less time on the Voynich and more time on, say, other ciphers that have been cracked or old manuscripts in general, it might have been a more engaging experience. But the back half of the semester just seemed to drag on in an endless cycle of \"we're back to where we started!\" As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this class to another student.",
    "Absolutely, this is a really fun class for anyone, including those with no linguistics experience at all.",
    "Yes! Take this class because its super cool and you actually do work that could help break the Voynich!",
    "I would encourage someone who is interested in this course to shop it and see if it could be something that you're into. I took this as a senior premed who was looking to take some quirky and fun courses outside of the STEM sphere in their last fall semester and this one fit the bill pretty nicely. Dr. Bowern is a lovely professor and I really liked learning from her this semester. The Voynich Manuscript (VMS) is super obscure and very ominous. If you're the type of person who is into conspiracy theories or cryptography or old-timey pseudosciences like astrology and herbal medicine then this could be a good fit for you. Although we do spend some time talking about linguistic topics (like codes, ciphers, properties of languages, etc.), the course is very approachable and you by no-means need to have taken a linguistics course prior (I did not, and neither did anybody I knew in the class). The workload is pretty light and by the end of the semester the topics are so obscure that there isn't even anything to read about. The final project is basically your chance to take a crack at solving the VMS from any angle you like. The freedom and flexibility were nice, but it was quite a bit of work and required a lot of planning (its hard to attempt to solve an unsolvable manuscript...). Some things that I would warn are that this is definitely a course where you only get out of it what you put into it. It's kind of a \"leminar\" format and it's easy to zone out and disappear into the background if you want. Also, the course does get a little repetitive towards then middle\/end when you start debunking every theory to have ever existed. Grades are not very transparent either (I have no idea how I'm doing in the course at this moment). Overall, if you think you can let yourself get caught up in all of the conspiracies and theories and can really buy into the whole 'ominous manuscript with secret meaning' thing, then I say go for it!",
    "YES! It's a fascinating course that Claire Bowern is an expert in, It shows a wide range, and truly there is something for every student to find fascinating about the VMS--what is most exciting is the final project is a fully open foray into the VMS, and professor Bowern supports all types of Inquiry. Every course at Yale is that you get what you put into it, and this is a course that is worth putting the effort into.",
    "It's fun! It's fresh! It's interesting! It's something you'll never encounter anywhere else. This class is a meme but honestly I lowkey learned and internalized more from this class than I did from pchem hahaha",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student that loves to perseverate on a puzzle.",
    "Yes! This course is completely unique to Yale since the Beinecke is fortunate enough to hold this manuscript. Professor Bowern is a leading researcher on the VMS and the theories on what the VMS may say are really wild. Awesome class"
