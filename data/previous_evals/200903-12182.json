   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about intellectual issues facing latin america in the 60's from another point of view, ie, not from literature or history, but from film and film theory. be prepared to watch these long and sometimes slow movies which are not necessarily \"easy\" to watch. but this class will definitely introduce you to ideological struggles faced by many latin americans in the 60's.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in radical Latin American films from the 1960s.",
    "Take this class if you can - it is a really solid introduction to Latin American radical cinema; Moira is one of the best professors at Yale - she is incredibly supportive, available and kind. In this class we learned about the films, sure, but we also learned a great deal about Marxist theory, intellectual and political developments in the 1960s, some psychoanalysis, historical developments across Latin America and so on. What a class.",
    "I recommend it, definitely. To Latin American Studies majors, to film studies majors, to people who might or might not have Marxist tendencies. If anything, just check out the movies!This was a great course, it was at many times the highlight of my week. I think it was the class dynamic and Moira above all that made the class successful. It really challenged me in the sense that I had to really let go of any assumptions I had about Latin American politics, even though I myself am Latin American. The film selections were amazing -- truly a luxury to watch them. The class might be improved if we could actually find films from all parts of Latin America, if we could all have a solid foundation of history (you'd think that film would be the easiest and most digestable way of learning history...but), and if more sources were available in English (I had an advantage with Spanish). I think the class really reinforced my research skills. Also, because the class tends to generate a lot of discussion it attracts many talkative (albeit brilliant) students and some of us others don't get to participate that much.Moira is amazing. She is wonderfully all over the place (mentally, physically), it's amusing. Very approachable, really invested in contacting us about everything, really genuinely interested about every one of us and making us better people overall. If there are moments where she seems to not be very concordant with our ideas it is to challenge assumptions we might have. Really puts her heart in the content.",
    "Yes, definitely. The screenings are long but the movies are really good",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, if you're ready for all that it entails: strong political, literary discussion with a view that looks critically at everything around us.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The films are amazing (and rare) and the discussion is engaging and informative. I realize now that I had no concept of what Latin American films were before this class. It's a thoroughly eye opening education on US imperialism and the revolutionary state of Latin America.",
    "If you have a real interest in Latin America, then you don't want to miss this course. Professor Moira Fradinger is one of the most dynamic and interesting professors that you are likely to find at Yale. The course can be somewhat difficult, because engaging with the material requires you to really think about each film in the context of the intellectual and social environments in which it was made, but the hard work that this course requires inevitably pays off with refined research skills and vibrant class discussions. It would probably help to know something about 20th century Latin America before taking this course, but the can help to catch you up on what you don't know. For a challenging but worthwhile look at a subject that is only beginning to get real attention, take this course!",
    "The films we watched in class were truly radical, truly cinema, and truly Latin American. It was amazing that we were able to screen one of the only copies in the US of certain films. The course was interesting, engaging, informative, and overall a great experience.",
    "radical cinema of latin america offers and expansive overview of national latin american cinemas from the 60's to the present (if i include movies seem during reading week.) i would highly recommend this class to my fellow students.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. You probably won't learn so much about the technicalities of cinema, but you will get so much more out of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to people who are willing to question their way of approaching film."
