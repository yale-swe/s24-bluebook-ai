   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course, it is one of the best I have taken at Yale",
    "I would not recommend this class at all. It was disorganized and I did not learn anything except when I sat down to read the key points of each chapter in the textbook before our final exam (that is also all I needed to do to get a 95% on the exam).",
    "The class had a lot of brilliant speakers come in, and is a great way of interacting with individuals how have held very influence policy roles.However, little new is really learned.",
    "An eye opening experience",
    "Great class to take. The experience of being taught by Domingo Cavallo is invaluable. It is very much the reason I picked Yale over other universities.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in global economics",
    "The course is almost only focusing on Latin America's economy. So,I don't recommend this course to another students if they don't have much interest for Latin America's economy.",
    "\"A practically-focused course that uses economic tools to discuss and analyze public policy in Latin America in the past 20 years from the point of view of some of the key decision makers in government\".I would recommend this course to other students because it offers a practical application of analyses that are usually much more theoretical and conceptual.",
    "Very interesting to hear the experiences from the various guest speakers. The course might not be the best choice for anyone who wants a rigorous and theoretical course, since the content is a little too light.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF THIS PROFESSOR IS TEACHING AGAIN",
    "It is a very good course to gain an insight of relevant and real applications of economics in the real world.",
    "Excellent and interesting guest lectures, very insightful perspectives and interesting discussions on current topics. Rather slow and not so useful theoretical lectures.",
    "International economics 702 is an applied course in international economics with very interesting lectures on particularly latin american economics. Prof. Cavallo invites numerous very interesting guest speakers throughout the semester. Compared to other graduate level international economics courses, this course is more applied and in some occasions too easy in my opinion. Nevertheless, I learned a lot in this course and would recommend it to other students.",
    "Comments included on paper evaluation form.",
    "The class is frustratingly disorganized and the material is taught at the undergraduate level.I would not recommend this class, unless you were looking for a recommendation from a well connected politician from argentina.",
    "This class was helpful for me to meet alot of top leaders and economists, yet I did not learn much of international economics.",
    "This class may be better suited to a seminar type class, rather than having a focus on technical content."

   "comments": [
    "I now have a much better understanding for international economics and how trade works",
    "I learned from the guest speakers and from the personal experiences of the Professor.",
    "I learned some interesting things about trade and currency from our textbook.",
    "My goal is to follow Dr. Cavallo's steps and have the opportunity to contribute to my country as finance minister in the future. The coursework was extremely relevant not only to build the conceptual foundations of international economics but also to gain the intuition that will lead my decision-making once I'm in office.",
    "It did not really deepen my knowledge of the discipline. We very rarely discussed economic models or theories in the classroom. We were encouraged to read chapters of certain books at home but this was completely independent of all class discussions.It did help to deepen my understanding of how policy makers in government make decisions and what type of information they require and analyse in order to make those decisions.",
    "It will be relevant to my fieldof work in the future.",
    "DID NOT HELP AT ALL. Absolutely useless becuase of the way it was taught.",
    "Was very useful especially for those in the class not continuing in academia.",
    "The course definitely triggered my interest in international macroeconomics and I would like to study this field in more detail in the next semester and possibly in further graduate studies.",
    "Comments included on paper evaluation form.",
    "Because I met top leaders, their experience expanded my viewpoints and knowledge.",
    "The speakers were very helpful in fleshing out the economic topics we had been studying."
