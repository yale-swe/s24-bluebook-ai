   "comments": [
    "A class giving good exposure to quantum chemistry and NMR, with the emphasis on the latter. Only theory though, so that useful for experimentalists.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student. It is difficult but I learned a lot from it.",
    "This course starts with a review of basic quantum mechanics and group theory, then introduces the effects radiation-induced quantum changes, focusing on NMR",
    "The best course of the first semester physical chemistry sequence! Don't listen to bitter people. It was probably hard in the past, but with a discussion section and answer keys to the homework, you are set for life.I would definitely recommend Chemistry 540 (as if you had a choice). Savor the instruction of Prof. Zilm while you still can!",
    "This lecture is really nice to study lot of methods in physical chemistry. Especially, it would be a bridge to consider quantum chemistry and spectroscopy method.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course",
    "Mol Rad is a challenging course, but it is very doable if you put in the work. It is a good example of what is expected of a student in a graduate level course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I'd say it's a really difficult class, but that it goes over some very fundamental, yet detailed, portions of quantum chemistry. If the class was appropriate for their end goal then I would suggest they take it. Otherwise I'd save myself a lot of grief and take something else."

   "comments": [
    "It deepened my understanding of quantum chemistry and NMR.",
    "I am interested in going into NMR spectroscopy so this course was very good in giving me the appropriate background I need to understand how NMR works at a quantum mechanical level.",
    "It has reinforced my understanding of quantum mechanics and provided a good theoretical background in physical chemistry research.",
    "I am now thoroughly educated in spectroscopy and can understand what is going on in physical chemistry seminars as was promised by the instructor. I have not started research yet, but it has made me want to do both experimental work and theory.",
    "It helped me improve my knowledge about spectroscopy substantially",
    "It provides detailed information (mechanism and experiment) of spectroscopy which is helpful forboth theoretical and experimental physical chemists. Therefore I find it helpful for my future research.",
    "It gave me background into an area of chemistry I wasn't very familiar with."
