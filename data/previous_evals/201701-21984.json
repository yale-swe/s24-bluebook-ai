    "Learned how to apply political philosophy concepts to works of literature and popular film.",
    "Mad philosophical and afrofuturist stuff",
    "This course was critical in the expanding of the way in which I read texts. Professor Lebron was very adamant about teaching the course as that of political theory, and therefore understanding texts fictional or otherwise as holding a sort of thesis to be extracted. To that end, the way in which I engage with narrative fiction, has developed and gained the additional perspective of reading for thesis as well as theme and \"meaning.\" This has proved invaluable in my other courses, particularly the film courses I am taking for my major."

    "The syllabus was amazing and the class discussions were engaging.",
    "Strengths: amazing subject matter and reading list, amazing Prof, Weaknesses: wish we could have read more \/ wish the final paper could have focused on just a couple texts instead of trying to encompass very many",
    "He could make class a little more directed. Sometimes I thought that we talked about a lot but I didn't know where we were going with it. Sometimes his questions were too broad too and I would have liked them to be more specific. As for strengths, the books were good and the supplemental reading was good for the most part. I think the class room environment was good everyone was allowed to contribute and didn't feel pressure to be quiet.",
    "more confined essay prompts",
    "Dum long readings but some times the novels was chill",
    "The course is structured very well, leading to a lot of attention on individual concepts pertinent thereto as well as a strong arc leading from the beginning set of concepts to the ending set. The amount of reading for the course, however, can be harrowing, and at times too much, making it difficult to engage with the entire syllabus. Given the careful attention placed into crafting said syllabus, with each text contributing a certain set of ideas, this can potentially lead to a deficit in the engagement with an otherwise amazing course."

    "This course was awesome. Professor LeBron was both passionate and engaging in the subject. Prof. Lebron did an excellent job at encouraging class participation and discussion. Of course, Prof. Lebron was awesome so Yale decided not to hire him as tenured faculty. It's weird right??? A school that complains about not having enough faculty members of color and yet they consistently hire predominately white males to fill tenure tracks. But I'm sure Yale filled the available tenure track position with a person of color...",
    "Lebron is leaving so you won't be able to take it. Amazing course though. Take classes on afrofuturism if you can.",
    "I'd hesitate. The teacher requires a lot of work when I don't think the class is as engaging or challenging as it could be. I'd recommend it credit d for sure.",
    "Yes, but alas",
    "Ya",
    "I would highly recommend this course, as Professor Lebron's way of teaching political theory is at once highly useful and very accessible. I would warn, however, that the level of engagement required to truly gain insights is rather high, and that taking this course may require taking a less intense course in addition to balance the workload."
