   "comments": [
    "Anyone who loves Harry Potter should take this course. But especially if you have even the slightest interest in or question about theology. I've never taken a theology course though I've always thought about \"how is there a god if there is evil?\" and such questions. This class provided an awesome framework (Harry Potter) in which to thin about and discuss such questions.",
    "Look at the terrific series of Harry Potter through the lenses of a Christian World view. Compare and contrast several important topics. Learn more about HP then you every thought you would!",
    "You should absolutely take this class if you can get in! Professor Tumminio is amazing, the work load is light, and you get to read Harry Potter. It was the most enjoyable course I have taken during my Yale career, and it's perfect for senior year because you get a chance to experience your childhood all over again. For those of you who are worried about the religious component of the class, you shouldn't be. The class basically just encourages you to ask difficult theological questions and interpret them through the lens of Harry Potter.",
    "If you get in, absolutely take it. Don't worry if you don't have much background in Christian theology; the class is absolutely accessible. Just make sure you proofread your papers for grammatical\/spelling mistakes.Professor Tumminio makes discussion really interesting and really do a lot to clarify Christian theological concepts with Harry Potter.",
    "Totally would recommend this class. It's interesting and fun and the professor is great.",
    "Definitely take it. The class teaches you to think in a unique way by examining Christian Theology through the lens of the familiar Harry Potter series.",
    "Absolutely take it if you get a chance! Asides from another reason to re-read Harry Potter, this class gives you a lot to think about and allows you to actually analyze the series in a way that you probably wouldn't have a chance to do otherwise. I came into the class with no Christian background at all, and really enjoyed the Christian theological readings we did. The topics were extremely interesting, and I liked that the class was not at all preachy. You could tell that Professor Tumminio had a background as a Christian theologist, but only in a sense that she had answers to questions about it, and not that she was leading the class in a way that made you too aware of it. I felt very comfortable speaking up even with my lack of background. I do wish class discussions were a bit more structured but this means you got to speak your mind freely. I also really enjoyed that we got to read and discuss each other's reading responses.",
    "Definitely a unique class! It was a lot of reading - you read all the Harry Potter books along with readings on Christian theology. Some weeks there was a lot of reading to get through, which I wasn't able to do. As a result, I don't think I got as much out of the class as I could have. It was definitely a different way to look at the books, though! I think I ended up learning the most from the reading responses, but especially the papers because they really gave me a chance to dig deep and really develop my thoughts. Most importantly, though, Professor Tumminio is one of the coolest, kindest professors, and she brings an incredible excitement and enthusiasm to the class. She is also an expert at what she does and will really help you grow in how you think during this class, even if it's outside your comfort zone.",
    "This is absolutely a must-take class. Professor Tumminio is excellent and makes every class something you are excited about going to. Plus, you get to read Harry Potter for credit. There are no flaws.",
    "Far and above one of the most fun and, honestly, fascinating classes I have taken at Yale.Obviously, it's super fun to get to reread the Harry Potter books and talk about Harry Potter in class. It turns out that the theology is also interesting. As far as looking for the theology in Harry Potter, I would say that for the first eight or nine weeks we had a ton to talk about, and then it started feeling a little repetitive, but other than that, awesome class!",
    "This course was fun and intellectually stimulating, but it didn't blow my mind. Having a strong background in theology, my learning was mainly in the application of theology to literature and in hearing others' perspectives (which were thoughtful and creative about 70% of the time). It was definitely cool to hear how total HP nerds could apply theological concepts to things I didn't pick up on in the books, but I felt like there needed to be a bit more substance to the course, since we seemed to end early on a few days because there was no use in dragging things out to fit the time. I really respect Tumminio's thoughtfulness, her ability to facilitate discussion without determining it, the way she makes theological concepts accessible to everyone, and her humility. I liked this course, and I know this year was unique in having fewer people of strong religious background, but I'm not sure I would take it again if I were to go back to September, since I feel that I could've learned more in a different course.",
    "Christian Theology and Harry Potter was a great course! I would definitely recommend the course if you have the space in your schedule. Prof Tumminio was a really kind and engaging professor that made the class even better. Reading isn't too bad, especially if you've already read the Harry Potter series previously and are interesting even if you have no theological background."
