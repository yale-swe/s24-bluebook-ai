    "Take it. DO IT. SUCH A GOOD CLASS!!",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. It was a lot of fun. Not too difficult, but definitely rewarding.",
    "Contemporary British Fiction was a great course. The syllabus is full of wonderful pieces and is designed so you can read it all without being overwhelmed. Caz is great--serious teacher, but funny guy. Just be warned that this is almost more an anthropology class than an English class, focusing on broad themes of British life more than the traditional Yale close reading.",
    "I would certainly recommend it! Yes, yes indeed!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The syllabus is great (includes not only novels, but also films and plays) and it's an unconventional way to learn about British history and society since the 1950s. Caz a really good discussion leader, makes himself available to students outside of class, and fairly laid-back.",
    "Caz is amazing. Yes, he's intimidating at first, but he really cares about the people in his class; once you're in, you'll form a great relationship with him. Not only has he really studied the syllabus, he has LIVED it. And although he's got plenty to say as a result, he is also genuinely interested in learning from his students. You read, you chat about it very candidly, and you write a final paper--it's engaging and enjoyable.",
    "This is an amazing class. One of my favorite English classes. Why not take it? Great reading list, interesting class discussions, studying contemporary British fiction with one of the great contemporary British fiction writers... Aside from the reading, there is only a paper proposal and the final paper. Prof. Phillips is very helpful with paper topics, reading drafts, etc.",
    "The reading was fantastic, and you may not have heard of any of these authors before - so that's definitely a reason to take the course, it will enrich your life and your understanding of the world. The class discussions were also really interesting. I think we had a bit less guidance on the essays than is provided in some other 400-level English classes, so that might be something to take into consideration - if you're okay working independently, you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend this class. We read a variety of plays and short stories (and the reading wasn't even too heavy for an English seminar) and I think I got a good sense of the time period in England. Professor Phillips is very helpful in developing a final paper topic and finding additional sources to use.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. The books were fantastic and the discussions were great. I particularly enjoyed discussing the historical context behind each book. Remains of the Day and To Sir with Love are two of my favorite books now. This was definitely one of my favorite courses at Yale.Caryl Phillips is the best professor. This course definitely wouldn't have been the same with a different professor teaching it. He is not only funny and really caring about the students, but he's great at guiding the discussion to keep the students on the right track. Often in a seminar, students get lost in tangents, but Professor Phillips was perfect at keeping the discussions interesting. He made this class the best seminar I've ever had. He is also eager to help the students outside of class and read anyone's rough draft. He's amazing.",
    "Definitely take into consideration the reading list for this course. The professor is VERY interested in looking at the social and historical context THROUGH literature, and this can often feel much more like a sociology or history course than an english one. If that's more what you're looking for, then great-- Caz is a lot of fun, and very informative. However, he does often seem to be looking for you to have the same reading as him, and there does seem to be \"a right answer\" much of the time. In fact, his opinion on every novel can probably be summarized as: racism in English society psychologically destroys immigrants. Again, just know what you're getting into before you take this class.",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "It's a class filled with great novels that you will be happy to read, take it."
