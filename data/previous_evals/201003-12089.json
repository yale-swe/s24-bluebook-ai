   "comments": [
    "A class where you both learn a lot and have a good time. Professor McKee is a great lecturer and keeps the class interesting. Definitely TAKE THE CLASS!",
    "Yes, one of the best seminars I have taken.",
    "Yes. Professor is very helpful and the class setting was enjoyable. It didn't feel like a 2 hour class",
    "Yes. Econ of Aging might seem like a boring topic, but Prof. McKee has a way of making it very interesting. You will learn a lot about the topic and about applied econometrics. You read 2-3 papers a week and then they are explained in class, so you always get out of class understanding everything very well. You also get to develop your own research proposal, so it's hands on learning.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. The material is interesting, the workload is manageable, and Professor McKee isfantastic. Simple enough.",
    "I definitely recommend Econ of Aging to other students--Prof. McKee is great, the topics are interesting, and it's an engaging and lively seminar atmosphere. You will definitely learn a lot.",
    "It teaches the field of economics of aging individuals by reading various journal articles and papers. It is great to help better understand complex models and also better understand the economic decisions of the elderly.",
    "Awesome class. If you need an econ seminar, take this. Great professor (Doug's the man), structured well, with a manageable course load on interesting material."
