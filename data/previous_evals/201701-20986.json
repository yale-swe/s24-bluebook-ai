   "comments": [
    "This semester built very well off of the skills we focused on in L1. There was a greater emphasis on speaking and grammar this semester, which certainly allowed us all to begin to form more complex sentences and hold longer conversations. In addition, almost all of the classes were conducted in Persian, which helped tremendously with pronunciation and cadence, which are difficult to pick up without hearing the language often.",
    "Impressive amount of vocabulary, grammar and conjugation as well as the ability to speak and understand basic conversations.",
    "In this class we built upon our foundation of knowledge from PERS 110; we expanded our vocabulary to include clothing, transportation, professions, and telling time. We also learned more advance grammatical structures such as subjunctive, imperative, condition \"if\/then\" statements, and prepositions. I feel that my conversational Persian has greatly improved as well as my written Persian.",
    "I really enjoyed this class like last semester and thought that my language skills greatly improved throughout the semester. I think my listening skills specifically improved in the latter part of the semester.",
    "Building on the first term, this course further developed my understanding of the structure and usage of the more grammatical aspects of the language. This second term was gratifying because the knowledge gained has allowed me to make much better use of the language.",
    "I developed my language learning skills dramatically. In addition, I've learned a lot of Persian and can communicate very well in the language.",
    "In L2 we expanded our knowledge of verbs, using imperative and subjunctive tenses and our ability to create complex sentences. This semester we also wrote several compositions which aided us in being able to converse about our every day life."

   "comments": [
    "One of the major strengths of this course is definitely its small class size, which allows a lot of one on one instruction and support. In addition, Professor Shayesteh is an amazing instructor, who makes every class engaging, enjoyable, and interactive. This class is a wonderful change of pace from lecture style courses in which students have little opportunity to interact with the professor or one another; in this course, it is guaranteed you will spend a lot of time speaking with your classmates and asking questions. One way the course may be improved is for the professor to allow students to submit anonymous feedback of the course of the semester to allow students to share input regarding what they are currently finding challenging. I think this would be particularly beneficial in L2, as the focus on grammar and writing increases.",
    "I think this course could be improved if there were tests every 2 chapters instead of every 4. More frequent tests (or at least quizzes) puts more pressure to really memorize the new vocal and grammar. I also would have appreciated more feedback on oral presentations.",
    "The strengths in this course are the camaraderie between the students in the class and the guided instruction we receive in grammatical concepts. It is important to establish a good classroom relationship between the students as they will be seeing each other every day for an entire semester. And it is also important that we don't get too far ahead of ourselves with the grammar. Professor Shayesteh ensured both of these things. The one weakness I would say is the Friday lessons; there simply is not enough information to cover in those sessions. They are meant for practicing conversation, but we spend more time writing and planning out our conversations than we do speaking them.",
    "One weaknesses I think is that the course textbook does not always match up with what we cover in class. The textbooks are a bit antiquated and sometimes the discontinuity of the material in the textbook with the material we discuss in class can be confusing. However, there are many more strengths with this class. The professor pushes you to learn as much as you can in one semester, and if you invest enough time then this class is quite rewarding. For example, we had to give a 6-8 minute presentation at the end of semester without any notes, and if you asked me if I would be able to do this at the beginning of the semester, I would not have thought it possible. It did require many hours to memorize the presentation and some degree of considerable stress, but I was able to exceed my own expectations. Like I said, the class is rewarding if you put in the effort.",
    "The structure of the class is more than adequate to allow each student to progress at an appropriate pace. The combination of textual and oral instruction is perfect for developing an understanding of how and why certain aspects work together. If anything, the only improvement to the course would be more time spent speaking, although the current allotment is more than adequate.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the amount one will learn in the course. I know more after two semesters of this course with Professor Shayesteh than I learned after years of Spanish in the past. The only weakness would be the time commitment - however, the amount of time this class takes up is worth it in the end.",
    "The professor does an excellent job of supplying the class with various handouts that serve first as homework but then as handy reference sheets. I found it incredibly helpful to have handouts that I completed and could pull out when I needed to jog my memory or study. The professor also mixes up the way we learned: word games, writing sentences on the board and checking each other, listening to Iranian music, cultural discussions and presentations."

    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Persian is by far one of the most engaging and enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale. Like any language, the workload is significant, but the progress you will make will make it all worth it! In addition to learning the language, Professor Shayesteh also organizes several cultural events (ie: movie screenings, lectures, and dinners) over the course of the semester that allow you to learn more about the culture and history of Iran. By the end of this course, I feel comfortable holding a conversation with a native speaker, and am able to discuss a wide variety of topics. Professor Shayesteh will ask a lot of you, but she will also allow you to reach a level of proficiency significantly beyond other languages at Yale (from what I understand). Persian is a beautiful language, and although its script may seem challenging at first, it is Indo-European language with grammar structures more similar to Spanish or French than Arabic. If your even considering Persian, TAKE IT!!!",
    "Highly, highly, highly recommend. Taking Persian was one of the highlights of my Yale experience, and my biggest regret is waiting until my senior year to take it. Prof. Shayesteh is passionate about the Persian language and cares deeply about every student's improvement over the semester. The workload is more frequent than most Yale classes (homework every night) but generally was not enormously time consuming. As Shayesteh says, you have to practice a little every day in order to improve, so the homework assignments are worth it. I found this class extremely rewarding, and I feel a greater sense of accomplishment at the end of two semesters of Persian than from any other Yale course I've taken in my 4 years here.",
    "The Persian language is simply fascinating; if you're looking for a new language to learn but have no idea which one to take, take Persian. Professor Shayesteh (Ostad, as we call her) is honestly like a second mom: caring, but firm. She will ensure that you leave this course with not just an intro-level confidence in your Persian skills, but also with a deeper understanding of Iranian culture and history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student passionate about language learning. If you are willing to work hard to gain language proficiency and are not afraid of making mistakes you should take this class. The professor takes into heavily into account your effort, rather than raw performance and language ability when grading. This helps to facilitate more passionate language learning rather than memorizing and regurgitating words on a test.",
    "I would absolutely recommend, and have already recommended, this course to other students. The quality of instruction and the satisfaction gained from learning a beautiful and complex language are benefit enough.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student, especially one who is interested in learning a language that opens a door into a culture not many other students completely understand.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Persian to other students. The professor facilitates a fun learning environment and does her best to ensure that no one falls behind. The small class size allows everyone to get to know each other which makes people feel comfortable and more confident, a component that is necessary for learning a new language."
