    "This class provides an overview of chemical reactors. You leave this class with an understanding of how a variety of reactors work, you learn what assumptions need to hold, you learn how to combine them effectively to obtain desired thermodynamic and kinetic outcomes.",
    "A very good insight into kinetics.",
    "Gets you more into the Chem E-side of things as your courses start to really bend away from chemistry. Still a good balance of topics from chem courses (all the reaction kinetics stuff isn't too difficult to pick up) and some",
    "The general understandings and workings of reactions and the reactors they occur in.",
    "I learned a lot about different types of chemical reactors and how to derive design equations for all of them, in addition to understanding the context of each reactor, which I believe is great preparation for going into industry."

    "This course was absolutely fantastic. Professor Zhong is an engaging lecturer, and he made the material incredibly accessible to us. The problem sets were fair in length and scope. We had two midterms and a final -- Professor Zhong was always available to help and assist. This class is a gem in the chemical engineering department!",
    "This course was great! Professor Zhong taught the material clearly and went at a good pace. The tests were fair but still required that we thoroughly review the course material. This helped me absorb the information and get as much out of the class as possible.",
    "This is the best engineering course that I have ever taken at Yale. It is so well organized and it is very clear what the objectives are of the course. The tests are fair if you study hard for them.",
    "The textbook for the class wasn't great but was online through orbis which was great. Class notes tended to be more helpful. The professor was a good lecturer.",
    "I thought that the class was thought very well. Professor Zhong took everything step by step, he always told us exactly what we would be tested on in class. The text book we used was also really helpful. Really a great class, it was not difficult at all. Professor Zhong was great! If professor zhong is teaching, I wouldn't worry about this class in comparison to other Junior ChemE courses. This class doesn't take as much time as say transport or Pchem",
    "This class is amazing. It teaches the material without the extra busy work, and I came away knowing the exact concepts I needed to rather than how to solve homework problems.",
    "This course was great and very well organized. We followed the syllabus for the most part and we had a clear idea each time where we were headed. The level of organization is commendable."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Take it, especially with Professor Zhong. He is such an incredible lecturer, and he really cares about teaching well -- you really get to learn. He was also so considerate of all of us, and made sure we were always following during class. You won't regret taking this class.",
    "Most likely the only people who are taking this course are students who are required to take it for their major. However, with that being said I would still definitely recommend taking this course (especially with Professor Zhong!) The tests were fair as long as you studied the material, Professor Zhong was great (his notes were clearly and he was always helpful at office hours), and the workload was low relative to other STEM classes at this level. Overall a great course that can teach you a lot but isn't very time consuming.",
    "Yes -- absolutely take this course if Zhong is teaching. Even if you aren't a chemical engineering major, take it.",
    "If you're a chemE major, you probably have to take it, but don't worry about it, if it's thought by professor Zhong, it'll be great!",
    "Absolutely. This is the best science class I have taken at Yale, and it will make you realize how you should have been learning your entire time. You will come away with a knowledge of the concepts and important points. You will spend time studying rather than completing stupidly long psets. Take this class with Prof Zhong, it is a fantastic course.",
    "I would recommend-- from what I've heard in the past about previous Kinetics professors, we got really lucky with Professor Zhong. Not too much work and overall an enjoyable experience.",
    "Need to take it for ChemE...",
    "If you're reading this you probably don't want to take this class but have to take it thanks to your major. So there's not much convincing here to do but try as much as possible to take it win Professor Zhong. He's truly amazing."
