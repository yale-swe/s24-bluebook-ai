    "I was able to expand my knowledge on land use planning concepts by thanks to Jessica's lectures as well as to guest lecturers' experiences and stories. I am now also able to apply these concepts to real-world planning scenarios.",
    "This is a great overview of a variety of land use topics and offers some perspective on urban issues (a topic largely missing from the FES curriculum)",
    "zoning history and tools",
    "An understanding of local land use legal considerations.",
    "I gained an overview of the land use field. Nice exposure to a diverse set of professionals.",
    "A great overview of land use planning. As a second year I had already engaged with many of these concepts, but I still learned something new each class. Some topics were entirely new, definitely make this class worthwhile! Each speaker was great, and provided in depth knowledge and examples for each topic.",
    "This was an excellent entree into the field of urban planning. For very little work I reaped high rewards. I wish more courses like this (quick overviews of a topic) were offered at FES.",
    "I learned new concepts and theory on land use. I really enjoyed the class it covered different interesting topics. To me It was very useful to narrow my interests."

    "They aligned perfectly. I was hoping to get more of a foundation of land use planning concepts out of this course before devling into more advanced course at FES and that is exactly what I got.",
    "Very well- Jessica laid out a clear plan for the semester and followed that closely",
    "Very well.",
    "Well.",
    "Exceeded expectations.",
    "Take-away's from this class aligned perfectly with my expectations.",
    "I wasn't sure what to expect of a 1 credit course, but I was very pleased with what I got out of Jessica's class. It was well organized and most of the speakers she brought in were great. I appreciated the range of focus of the lectures.",
    "The topics covered in class and the material aligned with my expectations."

   "comments": [
    "I really loved having all of the guest speakers come in and talk about their experiences. My favorite guest speaker was Snigdha Garg from C40, partly because she was an FES alumnus and also because she worked on resiliency projects which is something I am very interested in. I loved the variety the course offered while also providing a solid foundation for concepts used in land use planning.",
    "I think the course offers alot of breadth but should be extended to 1.5 hours to allow for more class discussion and engagement with the speakers.",
    "The class length needs to be increased to 1.5 hour to allow for more discussions. This class is very informative.",
    "The topic presentations could be more direct, succinct.",
    "Nice variety of topics. Individual classes were too short (under an hour); speakers ran out of time each week.",
    "Strengths include great guest speakers, a variety of topics, and plenty of room for exploring specific ideas you are interested in. Jessica is a great lecturer, and is extremely knowledgeable!",
    "I would have liked to see more international cases. I felt the course and the majority of the lectures\/presentations were US-based. I recommend starting the class on time. Sometimes we run out of time, and there was no time for questions and sometimes the guest speakers were not able to finish their presentations."

   "comments": [
    "I would tell a prospective student that this class is essential for them if they are interested and plan to pursue land use planning as a career. It provides a great foundation for important concepts used commonly in the field and other more advanced land use planning classes at FES.",
    "This is one of the few land use planning\/ urban classes at FES so I think it is an important introductory course.",
    "Take it",
    "Take it! Really fun.",
    "This class builds overview knowledge of land use planning which is valuable for any FES student. There is material here that applies to every area of study. Do the readings to get the most out of the lectures (especially anything written by John Nolan). Great opportunity to learn under Jessica Bacher. She is a smart teacher who brings her land use experience to the classroom.",
    "This is a great class to take as an overview of land use planning concepts. Highly recommended for first years, and still recommended for second years - there will always be topics you haven't fully explored yet! Jessica and all the guest speakers are great, and provide lots of in depth subject matter knowledge. The workload is light, so it is a great one-credit to add.",
    "If you're considering taking this course, take it! There is no reason not to. It's a great overview of the topic, and you don't have to do much work. You'll get a glimpse into the legal and policy angles of this work, as well as some specific areas like green infrastructure and renewable energy siting."
