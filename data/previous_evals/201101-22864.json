    "great chance to work on something you love",
    "Senior essay. Mine was two terms. I recommend this if you want to do any substantial work, since you'll be able to dedicate an entire term to research and another term to writing. Works well.",
    "Senior essay. independent project. one semester long. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would suggest doing a year-long essay and to start writing early and to take the draft seriously.",
    "I highly recommend writing about something you actually care about. My experience was much better because I wanted to genuinely learn more about my topic of research.",
    "took the one semester spring version. Did reading until spring break and then started writing. wish I would have started a bit sooner, but otherwise manageable. The last month before it was due though, I basically worked on it every day for several hours."
