   "comments": [
    "Take it! Jap is fun!",
    "sure, if you want to learn japanese and are willing to put in the effort.",
    "Take it if you want to continue from first year Japanese.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of work, but hopefully it'll be a nice GPA booster if you put the time in.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it for any student wishing to go beyond basic Japanese. You will feel much more confident about your speaking and writing capabilities!",
    "You've come this far, and, yes, it has probably been difficult. But starting here it begins to feel more rewarding as well. Ganbatte!",
    "This class was great, it was significantly less stressful(more enjoyable) than L2. I'm not sure if one would want to be placed into L3 without going through L1,L2, as a lot of the L3 stuff is based upon understanding the earlier semesters' concepts.The first part of the year is based on the JSL text book, but after about 9 weeks, we moved onto the SuraSura book which has stories and more kanji. There were classroom discussions, but nobody was under (much) pressure to speak if they were uncomfortable or didn't understand what was going on.",
    "Japanese 130 is a continuation of first level Japanese. The format of the class and homework assignments stays pretty much consistent with the first year. In the middle of the semester, you change textbooks, but I felt the second textbook was an improvement. There is usually homework every night but again that is the same as first year of Japanese at Yale. It is a fun class though and well worth the work. The practice really helps you improve in Japanese.",
    "A little more intense than Japanese 110\/120, but the benefits in the end abound. The last of the basics are learned before you get to really use what you learned in context and for certain situations. The teachers are amazing and nice, but the class requires a level of investment to keep up with the fast pace.",
    "If your major includes a lot of reading and is not Japan oriented, I would not recommend taking Japanese. You will have very little time for your assignments, and all your work will suffer for it.If that is not the case, it's a lot of fun and amusing too. A lot of effort though."
