    "Covers more material than the standard first semester quantum mechanics course. We got to identical particles, perturbation theory, and the variation principle which I don't believe 440 really touches. Homework wasn't too bad, though the exams were very tough. Challenging midterm and an even harder final. That said, Sohrab is a very good lecturer, and his exams make you think and really know the ins and outs of what you're learning.",
    "Yes take it. Great course if you are interested in an into to quantum. I took it just because I was interested, I am not a physics major and I really liked it.",
    "This class was a tough, but in the end, very edifying look into basic quantum mechanics. Prof. Ismail-Beigi did a great job of communicating his enthusiasm for the subject and showed that he truly cared about his students learning. But that enthusiasm could sometimes be a little misplaced. The daily quizzes, for example, were often too detail-specific; even after reading the material (the stated objective of the quiz), the quizzes frequently remained difficult.Problem sets were fair and challenging! I am glad I took this course!",
    "Taught by Sohrab, APHY 439 was a good class but not exceptional. The material covered and grading was much more intensive than in years past, from my conversations with past students. Sohrab is a very engaging personality and makes an effort to connect with his students. Meeting with him outside of class WILL help your conceptual understanding and grade. That being said, the exams do not sync with the math-heavy lectures, since they focus much more on conceptuality, something that we didn't practice much during the course of the year. Over all, a good but VERY demanding class.",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you're into rigorous physics. With Sohrab, the class moves fast and is very mathematical, but you'll learn a TON of interesting material. The problem sets are hard but not unduly long and the exams are hard, but grades come out fair in the end. Stick with the class and you'll be rewarded with a great experience and by getting to know a great professor.",
    "If you are willing to take the work, this is a good way to learn the basics of quantum in one semester.",
    "This course is a really nice introduction to quantum mechanics that includes enough mathematical theory to make it somewhat rigorous, but not so much that it obscures the purpose of the subject. It covers all the basic quantum mechanical systems in 1D and 3D, spin and multi-particle\/identical particle systems, and also does some perturbation theory and variational principle. Definitely, definitely take it if Sohrab is teaching it. He's an amazing lecturer, always encourages questions (he would love it if the entire class were spent like a discussion section, which is probably how every science class would be like in an ideal world), and is very good at explaining concepts in a concise way to suit any learning style. Homework isn't too long and is mostly from Griffiths (great textbook), though Sohrab makes up his own questions sometimes, which usually involve important ideas or processes that are very helpful for learning the material better. Exams are hard, but only because he'll sometimes try to present problems you've never seen before but involve applications of concepts you already know. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, physics major or not."
