   "comments": [
    "A good understanding of plants and their unique position within the world.",
    "Understanding of plant biology, bit of history of human-plant interactions, and an appreciation for the importance of plants in our lives.",
    "More about plants.",
    "The relationship between plants and people, history of agriculture, plant biology, importance of plants",
    "General knowledge about plants and people! It helped me to see the world around me in a new way.",
    "I learned how to think about the world from an cultural ecology perspective! It has changed how I think about plants and the natural environment's impact on humans and human culture.",
    "I learned to think somewhat more holistically about the influence that plants and people have on each other.",
    "This was the most boring course I have ever taken and the professor didn't know much. The material was so vague that it wasn't worth my time, and yet the teacher requested a significant portion of my time. What a waste.",
    "I got a greater sense of how various theme fit into ecology and sustainability as we built from plant structure and drought effects to sustainable agricultural practices.",
    "I learned to connect ideas based in science and apply them sociologically in order to arrive at a full understanding of the interactions between plants and people.",
    "I learned a lot of nice ethnobotany, which isn't covered in Plant Diversity and Evolution. Most of the plant bio overlaps with Plant Div, but the general human-oriented approach means that it's still interesting.",
    "Very rudimentary botany.",
    "Through Plants and People, I learned to critically analyze my relationship with plants and the foods I eat. I learned how to understand science in a manageable light, considering science is not necessarily my best subject. Additionally, this class taught me how to move forward and protect the planet with sustainable actions.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of my environment and my role within it. The class and weekly field trips expose you to neat spots around Yale, and it helps to develop interest in more ecology courses.",
    "Learning how to read scientific papers at a collegiate level was a particularly worthwhile skill I gained from this course. What I found most interesting however was learning how to approach a singular issue - plants, in this case - with several different considerations or lenses in mind. For example, looking at a certain species as at once a physiologist, an evolutionary biologist, a sociologist, and a conservationist was an unspoken exercise we would do that made me consider the importance of perception on any issue, let alone plant science.",
    "Realising how plants have to do with every aspect of human life, and the intricate ways it plays in the ecosystems.",
    "Plant biology, ecology, plants in all different aspects of human life\/history (how plants have shaped the course of history and motivated human action, plants in culture, etc.), sustainability, global warming, agriculture (green revolution, sustainable, organic, etc.), wine\/beer, fermentation, coffee\/tea, habitat loss I pay attention a lot more to plants in daily life and have a greater appreciation for their importance. I better understand relationships between plants and ecosystems, and plants and humans. I feel more able to make life decisions with plants and the environment in mind (my diet & consumption choices, landscaping, protecting the environment, etc) and more able to judge decisions made by government or other institutions that relate to the environment.",
    "I learned a lot about plants and their structures and how they play a role in our lives. Good class about understanding ha due and it's effects on societies people and the world.",
    "Learned a lot about plants that we see and use every day, tree identification, environmentalism, and other cool planty things. The class is awesome."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Was a very high involvement class and had many interesting field trips and activities. Sometimes since things fly past very quickly as a result of the amount activities that are left.",
    "I thought the field trips were great but the lectures could be dry at times.",
    "Lectures were kind of boring, I wish they were more interactive, also I thought there was too much emphasis on basic plant biology (because we didnt use a lot about the cell structure and stuff like that for the bulk of the class) I learned most from the field trips and activities",
    "It's very interesting overall!",
    "Strengths: Linda Puth is an incredible professor, the curriculum is really engaging and there is something for everyone to get out of this class. The field trips also really solidified my understanding of a lot of the course concepts. Weaknesses: not many, honestly.",
    "Although I know this course was supposed to be a broad introduction to a lot of topics, I think that the course would benefit from going more in depth about fewer topics. However, I do think that the course did a good job bringing in a lot of different disciplines to deepen our understanding. The field trips were also a great part of the course and very memorable.",
    "The strengths are how well this course built from material in the beginning all the way through. I never felt it was disconnected. Rather, in the later lectures, I enjoyed knowing that I could think back to the early lectures. I think it may be in another class, but I would have liked more specific policy etc over the \"how\" of agriculture. Perhaps we could accomplish the \"how\" in readings (with quizzes?) and then discuss New YOrker type articles about policy. The concepts were so basic I would have liked to move further.",
    "I very much appreciated the structure of the course-- the foundational science, the interactions with humans, and the composite effect of these interactions. I likewise appreciated the opportunity for the final project, as well as the numerous field trips. Perhaps if the lecture units were even more thematically delineated between the three exams, the course would have an even more definitive arc.",
    "Strengths: a great intro to plant biology if you're not experienced with it, field trips are a blast (that are usually also educational), generally interesting presentation of science. Weaknesses: definitely has a high-school vibe, presentation of information often feels slow, tests are confusing On that last point--I would really recommend changing the test question format. Some are fine, but many are confusing enough that the entire class doesn't really know what they're asking. This often happens when they're trying to make the question more \"interesting\" or something of the sort ('make a diagram' kind of questions, etc.). While the effort is appreciated, it shouldn't be done at the expense of clarity.",
    "Great class, definitely fills the right niche.",
    "I loved the field trips--a very necessary part of the course.",
    "I think the field trips in this course are a major strength. Professor Puth and the teaching fellows really worked hard to increase participation and make the course engaging for all students. I think the exams were sometimes a bit hard to understand - I really appreciated the application-style questions, but sometimes I felt like I knew the material but didn't know how the professor wanted us to apply it.",
    "The course meets very regularly (4 times per week!), but the content is exceptionally interesting, and there are field trips once a week. You're much more engaged with this class than other Yale courses, and you learn from being directly in the field\/around topics of discussion.",
    "I found the field trips engaging, the lectures intriguing, and section incredibly useful. I especially enjoyed the guest lecturers and their specialist opinions on certain matters. I found the paper\/project to be a little much, in that I didn't think the in-class presentations were the best use of time with finals fast approaching and schedules often too busy to successfully coordinate accessible review sessions outside of section. That being said, I had a surprisingly fun time exploring my paper topic and would do it all over again if I had to.",
    "Strengths: - broad coverage - field trips are wonderful and crucial to learning Weakness: - 4 sessions a week is just too much.",
    "I loved the final paper\/project because I could dive into a topic of interest. I liked that we covered many different topics, but sometimes it felt a little rushed. Some lectures were a little boring (the first portion of the course was mainly plant biology), but on the whole, most were interesting since you could connect it to your own previous experiences with plants. The field trips were very interesting, and in a few lectures we even got to eat\/drink things like bread, fruits, coffee, and tea! We got to go to places on campus that I had never seen before (Marsh Botanical Gardens, the Yale Farm, and more). Overall the course was engaging, especially with Andy as my TF! The exams could've been improved because they were a bit strange, and sometimes the questions were weirdly worded and you had to figure out what specifically they were looking for.",
    "No weaknesses. this class a field trips which is like what??? unheard of. Class somestimes could be a tad boring. But with the amount that you learn there's a lot to look forward to.",
    "This course is awesome. Lecture is very engaging, section is pretty fun and enlightening, and the field trips are always very cool as well as instructive. The course is great just as it is."

   "comments": [
    "THIS CLASS IS HARD AF. I got a worse grade in this class than I did in Pre-med Bio. Don't let the reputation fool you.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is not a gut, you learn some very interesting things, but you have to engage with it. It is low stress and fun.",
    "Absolutely! It's hard to find science classes that are interesting\/worthwhile, but this is definitely one! It's a ton of fun, neat to see different sites on campus, and a manageable course. If you study for the exams, you should be fine, but the questions were very hypothetical, rather than straight from the material. I'd definitely try to get in- and go year after year to the first class, if you really want to take it, as the prof takes that into account in admissions. Don't be afraid if you're a freshman...the class surprisingly seemed weighted toward underclassmen.",
    "Yes, very interesting subject matter.",
    "it was a nice course and I'm glad I took it. Its not a lot of work outside of class, but it is a lot of time in class. If you take this course you should GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS they are so helpful.",
    "I loved this course! The lectures can be a little boring, but it is worth it for the field trips. You learn a lot about the importance of plants and how they have been used by humans over time",
    "Yes recommend! Very fun science credit!",
    "Yes! It is one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. Just so enjoyable to learn these things in this setting of the supportive classroom Linda Puth creates. The field trips are really fun. You learn some very interesting things.",
    "I would recommend this course with the caveat that you will be getting a broad introduction to a lot of topics, all of which could have their own class taught on them. The field trips are great additions to the class and you'll get to connect some topics that you might not have thought were connected in the past.",
    "absolutely not. extremely boring.",
    "YES! Great Science cred for non-stem majors",
    "I probably would not. I feel like I could accomplish this course from reading wikipedia. However, there is so much potential to get into more interesting material if the course were slightly more demanding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! This provides a humanist approach to a foundational science, and I have to admit, I now see the concepts I've learned manifested all around me. The exams are not quite as simple as they are purported to be, but this class was a pleasure to take all semester!",
    "I recommend for 1) people who don't really know bio who want to learn about plants in a doable, interesting way, and 2) bio people who want an easy course that covers some different topics from their other coursework.",
    "Take this course! Prof and TA's are excellent, and field-trips are awesome.",
    "If you are looking for an easy science credit, bingo!!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student - and I have already. This class was a really great introductory class to ideas of sustainability and plant growth, but was definitely approachable from a non-science perspective. I really appreciated how engaging the class was - I think this was a product of the time-commitment, with meeting four times a week (including section.)",
    "Absolutely. I was debating transferring from Yale, and this class changed my mind. It encourages you to think deeply about the world surrounding you, and it shows you the magic and beauty right here in New Haven. I would 100% recommend this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, especially to non science people. If you have a strong biology\/botany background this probably isn't the class for you. I learned so much and had so much fund doing so. We had lots of field trips to places that I didn't even know were on campus including the Yale Farm & Greenhouse. It's a really fun class and I definitely learned a lot and see plants differently because of this class. It's a great science credit if you can get in!",
    "Yes, I think it's a great course for students, whether EEB majors or not, since it ties in the role that plants play in societies' development.",
    "I would recommend it as a science credit because it is really easy, pretty interesting, and relevant to your daily life! It's not an automatic A though, you still have to study hard for the exams so you know your stuff. The exams weren't too challenging though, as long as you knew what you had to know.",
    "take this class just to be able to say to other students that you went on a field trip. Class you learn at lot you get field trips and it's a nice friday class to have and be done. you do have to get in tho because of the limit. so good luck.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student: take it if you can get in. The field trips are fun and will take you places that you haven't been before in Yale campus. It's not an easy class though, you will have to put in hard work and don't expect an A, but you really do learn a lot. Classmates tend to be extremely motivated due to the class size.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. Take it if you can. It is actually an interesting class and is very engaging. The workload is not bad at all, and there is a fun field trip once a week. You will actually learn something interesting about plants."
