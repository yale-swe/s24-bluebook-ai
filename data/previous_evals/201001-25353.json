    "YBOP: you spend the semester learning about baroque opera and then performing it.I would definitely recommend it to another student because it is very interesting, you learn a lot, and you get to sing awesome music!",
    "In this course, you learn about baroque opera by performing a work from the era. Every semester is different, but it is always an incredible experience. Rarely can undergraduates work with such highly esteemed musicians and directors, perform in amazing spaces, and have so much fun in the process! I highly recommend it.",
    "If you get into this opera, you should probably do it. It's hard to find anyone who doesn't have mixed feelings about YBOP, but it's fundamentally extremely worthwhile.",
    "An intense class that prepares you for an operatic production. It is quite time consuming but very worth it in the end.",
    "Take this class if it's still a big YBOP production! It's a ton of fun...you work with crazy professional people and put on an insane show with an amazingly talented cast. One of the most fun and least stressful classes I've taken.",
    "IF YOU GET IN, TAKE THIS COURSE."
