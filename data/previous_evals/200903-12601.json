    "Don't take it unless you're graduation date is 2018 or something. It needs time to age!",
    "Nah, if you're looking for a cr\/d, there are more interesting classes out there.",
    "I hear Death is better, but this isn't entirely a waste of a class. If you really wanted to, you could skip lecture, do none of the reading, and just go to section and turn in your papers. I don't know how much you would get out of the class if you did this, but it is possible.",
    "class about...life haha. basically the class discusses the pros and cons of various experiences and decisions you'll probably deal with, like whether to have kids, what value there is in relationships, and also how to go about considering morality and its relevance to your life. i'd definitely recommend it to those who are willing to rationally consider the pros and cons of all these aspects of life, otherwise you will get bored with it. overall i think the subject matter is something everyone should probably consider, so even if you don't want to take it, audit a few classes!",
    "Yes. Take it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "I think you should enroll in this class IF you will do the readings and get everything out of it you can. It's very easy for this class to fall to the wayside with not too much work--a few readings every week, which were SO incredible. Lectures are also very interesting, but after a while, many people stopped going to lecture. There are 3 essays which are graded very harshly, but as long as you show improvement your grade will also improve.",
    "Shelly Kagan is a great lecturer and everyone should take one of his classes at some point during their time here. The only criticism I have of his teaching is that I didn't feel that the lectures were always necessary to do well in the discussion section provided you had done the reading that week. On the whole though, Shelly's lectures were always very interesting and this is an interesting course to take if you're interested in discussing some of the bigger questions in life.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to other people. Especially at Yale, where I believe people are almost too busy to stop and reflect on their own lives, this class provides such an amazing structure for doing so. There are no reasons not to take this class - the lectures are amazing, the section discussions are fun, the readings and essay prompts are interesting, and the workload is manageable. TAKE IT!!!!",
    "Life is a very eye opening course and is great to take simply for the sake of learning and thinking about things you'd never really thought anyone else wondered about. I'd recommend the class, but only if the student had a knack for writing philosophy papers.",
    "If you take the class, always go to lecture. The lectures are interesting and you will get nothing out of the class if you do not go.",
    "Interesting class. You talk about many issues that trouble people everyday. You don't learn anything about theories that exist (for example in intro to ethics you learn about utilitarianism, you read Kant, etc). Here the readings are very diverse so it's more about getting you to think that teaching you new things.",
    "It's a fun course. The class itself is pretty easy: the weekly readings are interesting, but hardly vital; the paper grading can be tough but there are only three and if you improve, your first paper can be discounted entirely. That said, especially toward the end, the topics got somewhat repetitive and moralistic. I would recommend it because it's interesting, but it's definitely a question-raising class, not necessarily one in which you're going to learn a whole lot about anything except your own beliefs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you've never written a philosophy paper I would recommend talking to your TA and asking for tips on how to. If you don't really care though and just want to hear Shelly talk about interesting stuff, just take it credit D",
    "I would recommend it if you have never taken a philosophy because it is very interesting but definitely take it credit\/d. it is a great 5th class because it isnt too much work but the grading is very very hard.",
    "At the beginning of the course Kagan explained that the subject matter was really intended to get the people in the lecture thinking about which of the subjects he talks about are most important to them. While the class has a philosophical structure, the class will be much more interesting if you consider it a kind of life prep course. He has his students consider things like what people want out of love, what people want out of work, what the boundaries are on morality. I would recommend it, but only if you are in this kind of thing. The reading is largely unnecessary, he reiterated most of it in class, so that made the class easier.",
    "YES!",
    "Great Cr\/D class. Discussion and lecture can sometimes be a bit scattered, but if you're someone who enjoys bull sessions about the meaning of life anyway it won't feel like work.",
    "Yes. Kagan is an incredible lecturer and because this was the first time he's taught the class as a lecture, it's only going to get better.",
    "An interesting course, if you have a Cr\/D\/Fail to use on it. The papers are graded really harshly, but the workload is incredibly small otherwise. Although the readings do add to the course, they aren't really necessary when it comes to writing the papers.",
    "Interesting lectures, interesting (although optional) readings, and not much work at all. I also had a terrific section. Don't stress about the rumors re: Kagan's grading curve, although you should probably start of Cr\/D.",
    "Honestly, this class was the biggest waste of time ever. It makes me angry to think that I actually paid tuition money for such a stupid course. The only reason I went to the lectures was to make fun of them with my friends.Some of the things we \"learned\" this semester:-Yale students are better than students from other colleges.-People like babies because they are cute.-Critical-thinking and problem-solving skills are good to have.-People want respect.Lectures would frequently be long rants about unimportant subjects (like the definition of a lie, rather than why people lie.) Kagan is overrated and unorganized. He also has a very pompous attitude and forces his opinions on the class (\"People who don't believe in evolution are morons.\")Don't take this class if you want to learn anything.",
    "Do not take this class.",
    "I would take it again. Try to do all the readings, although some of them can be tedious (Aristotle).",
    "Interesting course and the workload was relatively light. However, grading on the papers is harsh. Would be a great class to take C\/D\/F",
    "A really interesting course, a lot of fun and not too much work. However the essays are graded very harshly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, if nothing else than for the ease factor. It was slightly frustrating due to the lack of a cohesive culmination of topics ofdiscussion, but all-around, this class was pretty fascinating. Also, given that this was the first time it's ever been taught, I expect GREAT things in the future.",
    "good classwould recommend it",
    "Good course. Do the readings because they are interesting. It is not too hard but should take it CR\/D\/Fail if you don't know how to write philosophy.",
    "This is a great class to take Credit\/D, especially if this is your first philosophy class. If you've never written a philosophy paper before, you're likely to get a surprising grade on your first paper, though if you work to improve yourself you'll see better results and also have your later papers count more toward your final grade to make up for the first one. The work is minimal though the readings are usually interesting, section is pretty engaging, and Professor Kagan is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "Great class! Very interesting topics that are relevant to us. Definitely makes you think about your life in ways you probably haven't before. A quintessential Yale \"learning how to learn\" type of class.",
    "I would recommend it because Shelly is brilliant and will make the necessary adjustments to the course to make the subject material a bit more interesting. He said on this first day that this version of the course was a test run and that he will make changes based on how things go. I think this is true and the man is a good enough lecturer that you will want to take his class in any case. It was decent this time, so next time it will probably be great.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who wants to think for themselves.",
    "Each week is a different topic. Some weeks are extremely interesting, and some weeks are extremely dull. The papers did not require research and tended to not involve anything from class.",
    "Life was a good class, but certainly not Shelly's best. The course follows the general outline of what is valuable in life, but tries to apply the analytic thinking that Shelly uses effectively in Death to a topic that doesn't really call for it. Overall, however, it was a good experience and something I would recommend. Don't be scared by the rumors of Shelly's grading; you just need to remember that like for any discipline, philosophy requires a specific style of writing. You wouldn't dare turn in a history or anthropology paper without citing sources, and so you shouldn't expect to have a paper full of beautiful language but little organizational structure get a good grade. Read the \"How to\" guide that Shelly provides, and understand that when he says to signpost, he actually means it.",
    "I think this class will be better in subsequent years than it was in this one. This was the first year Prof. Kagan taught this class as a lecture course, and during his lectures I often felt that he had not considered the topic at hand as deeply as I would have liked. The problem with a course like \"Life\" is that the subject material is so all-inclusive that discussions (whether in lecture or section) often tend toward vague generalities and truisms. I thought the lectures were much better when Prof. Kagan took a clear (but not self-evident) position on an issue and argued for it. All this said, though, \"Life\" is an excellent class to take Credit\/D\/Fail; you'll find it to be very little work.",
    "Take it if you like philosophy. 'Nuff said.",
    "Life is a survey course that basically covers ethics. I would recommend it as an interesting course, however I took the course in its first year and Kagan did not have any specific material prepared. The course will probably improve with time.",
    "I took this on a whim so I could take a class with renowned lecturer Shelly Kagan, and honestly I wouldn't take another class of his. There isn't that much work, only three 5-page papers (which are, of course, graded by the famously difficult Kagan standard). The topics made for interesting discussion in section, but I didn't find the lectures all that rewarding. I'd take it if you need a humanities credit, or if you just love philosophy. I expected the course to be a comparison\/contrast of modern andclassical theories of life in the viewpoint of the topics that Kagan picks out, but it wasn't. I didn't really glean any huge life lessons, but the class did teach me to think philosophically; in general, it was OK. Take it or leave it.",
    "If you're dying to know what Shelly Kagan thinks, then take it. I was sucked in at first, but as the course went on his arrogance became intolerable. Do not take it for a grade. Honestly, some people love Kagan, but I think he's pretty much a jerk, though a smart one.",
    "Practical topics like choosing a career, choosing classes, should you have kids, etc + abstract topics like what is love and why is it valuable? Overall good, but some topics were defeinitely better than others. Workload light - just 3 5-page papers. Section, at least for me, was the best part of the class - a chill discussion about anything related to the lectures, but still really insightful. Take this class for fun - credit\/D was fantastic.",
    "Life is a series of lectures on different aspects of a meaningful life - career, relationships, morality, etc. Shelly Kagan is a great lecturer, and although you don't come to any real or groundbreaking conclusions in the class, it is a fun break from other classes to sit for a couple hours every week and ponder what kind of life you want to have after graduation. The structure is also great, just three papers and sections. The grading is tough so consider taking it as a fun cr\/d fifth.",
    "Good class, not too much work, but only take it if you are interested in writing the kind of \"this is what I think...\" philosophy papers that Kagan is looking for.",
    "You will get as much out of this class as you put into it. The readings, while interesting and enlightening, are not necessary to do well in the class, nor is attendance at lecture. This doesn't mean you shouldn't read or go to lecture, though, since both are interesting and will make you think. If you participate in section and actually engage in the discussion, you'll be surprised how rewarding it can be to think though things you normally take for granted (love, friendship, education, honesty, etc) in a logical fashion. The papers are challenging, but once you get the hang of the format, it's not too bad.",
    "Read about and discuss broad, unanswerable questions in life - and never come to conclusions (because no one agrees on anything). It's very interesting though if you like to think about love, achievement, happiness, and the meaning of life.",
    "i would recommend this as a relaxed class in which you get to discuss and hear opinions about all the big questions in life. it can be discouraging how broad a topic it is because just when you get to the meat ofa question, the week is over and you have to move on to the next topic. the work load is very easy - 3 papers and small amounts of interesting reading - and the issues are very fun to discuss. the class did not change my perspective on life in any major way, but it was fun and interesting.",
    "would definitely recommend it, but take it credit\/ d unless you have philosophy experience",
    "i'd recommend this class because it's interesting to think about the topics we discussed. also, there isn't that much work- just do the readings (which are awesome) and write three papers.",
    "take it if you are a freshman, or just want a general survey of the philosophical questions in life. but take it cr\/d\/fail because unless you already know how to write a philosophy paper (and have a background in philosophy) you will be pretty lost when it comes to writing the papers",
    "at least shop it",
    "I would not recommend it. The course simply didn't offer enough satisfying nuggets of philosophical depth to be worth the time. It felt thin.",
    "take this course if you, 1. like writing philosophy papers, 2. like having really strange abstract discussion, 3. want to hear some good lectures on philosopy, 4. don't want to have a lot of reading, 5. prefer thinking about your own philosophical opinion rather those of famous philosophers. flaws of this course:the deterioration of its focus (and the quality of the lectures) as the course went on. philosphy papers are really hard to write, you're going to have to work really really hard and then be lucky to do well. take this C\/D\/F!",
    "Again:Life had great readings--some were dry--and they made you think about issues you'd never have considered in such depth before.Kagan is of course a great lecturer, but try not to doze off a little when he starts getting too convoluted.Sections are pretty great too, and you get to see what other students feel and think about love, friendship, career, happiness, etc.The grading is based on just 3 papers and section participation. Grading on the papers is known to be steep, but if you improve your grades the later ones are weighted much more heavily. So don't worry too much: you will get better.",
    "This course was very much as advertised.The lectures were okay.The section and essay writing experiences were phenomenal.Definitely a thought provoking experience, but not the most formative of my Yale career; there aren't a lot of 'answers' in philosophy, so don't take this class if that's what you're looking for...",
    "Take this course, especially if you can fit it into your schedule and only if you can take it credit\/D. I thought it was valuable in allowing me to step back and examine my life. It has given me a new perspective and has influenced the way I go about doing a lot of things. Don't expect to come away from the course with the meaning of life, but expect to leave with many little truths that will lend a new light to much of what you took for granted. Some parts of the course will be boring to you and some interesting, but inevitably there will be moments where you leave the course with a broad grin.",
    "Good. but not great. Recommend you take it credit\/D and just relax.",
    "Great class, but it is tough. Definitely take it for credit!! And even then you might have to work just to get a C. Really fun class though. And section is actually a great part of the class, unlike section for other classes.",
    "Take this class! Life was the most enjoyable course I've taken with Shelly Kagan, who is fantastic and first got me interested in philosophy. Philosophy isn't for everyone, but you should absolutely shop this course in case it's something you'll enjoy, because this class was very engaging and a lot of fun. If you're already into philosophy, you probably don't need my recommendation.",
    "This is a great class. Very interesting issues. Very relevant to one's own life. It's easy too - only 3 5-page papers are the entire workload.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend Life to another student; I signed up for the class hoping to discuss what the real value was behind life's biggest areas of concern (love, family, achievement, career) and what role each of them ought to play in one's life, but for too many of these units we would spend all of the time splitting hairs over what really defined love or what counted as an achievement and never got around to tackling why they mattered. Overall, it didn't end up being what I had hoped it would be, and I was a little disappointed with that. That said, I do think I learned how to write a philosophy paper well, and it could be a good first philosophy class for someone who wants to ease in to the department. Very little work, just not really worth the time.",
    "Not worth it. If you take a Kagan class, take death. This class was clich\u00e9 and uninteresting.",
    "This is a good class. I wouldn't really say it is as much of a philosophy class as a class on how to be a good person. The papers, however, are philosophy papers. If you don't really know how to write one, it'll kick you in the pants before you start writing good essays.",
    "A very cool class. If you take it Credit\/D it will be both relatively easy and you'll still feel like you're learning a ton.",
    "If you want to take philosophy it is interesting, but philosophy is a little different from other types of classes in good and bad ways.",
    "AMAZING!! take life or you'll regret it",
    "If you are good at writing philosophy papers and like to hear Kagan lecture, take it. Otherwise take it if you would like a good introduction to philosophy, but do not expect it to be real philosophical thought most of the time.",
    "Life is a very interesting course- not as much for what Prof Kagan will tell you, but more for simply making you think about a wide variety of topics that are very relevant to life and you'd never really stop to consider otherwise. Some lectures were simply amazing, and I'd walk out of there feeling like I had just discovered everything I had to know to live my life the right way. You have to take a class with Shelly Kagan while at Yale, and this is a great one to take- and besides, how cool is it to tell your friends you're taking a class called Life?",
    "You can get an A in this class without doing a single reading. About every other lecture was interesting, which for this class isn't enough. I found section more stimulating than lecture.",
    "Take this course. It's really interesting and not too much work. And you get a lot out of writing the papers so have fun with them. Kagan is worth the hype. Good man. Good class. You will have a good life, if you take it.",
    "This is not Professor Kagan's best course. If you want to take a course with Professor Kagan, take Intro to Ethics or Death. This is not as good of a class as I had hoped it would be.",
    "Take Life for the lectures that Shelly gives. It's fun to listen to what he says in class and decide whether you agree or not; the thought process you go through there (and while writing papers) is the meat of the class. The readings are okay; sometimes they're rather irrelevant. The grading in the class is not very merciful, so be warned - which makes this class an excellent option for Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "I hear that his other class, Death, is much more interesting. But then again, this is the first time he is teaching it so definitely do not give up on it. Your grade is based on three essays that are graded rather harshly while being given little guidance on how to write a good paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking to learn methods of thinking that will enable you to systematically evaluate things like the role of careers and children and money in your life. If, however, you're looking for a life-changing course that will challenge you to your intellectual core, you'd probably have to take the skills and apply them yourself.",
    "A good Credit-D class. only 3 papers.",
    "If you are looking to take an interesting and thought provoking class that doesnt require much work this is a great class. There is very little work. It would make a great 5th class.",
    "Intro philosophy course with impossible paper topics that are not answerable. I guess it could be considered a good intellectual exercise, but I found it to be a complete waste of time.",
    "Make sure you know what you're looking for when you go into this class. You are not going to be reading classics, you are not going to even be necessarily reading that much, you are not going to go through this class and learn what you should major in or which friends you should keep or what career would be a good choice for you. You are going to get fascinating lectures about the natures of those subjects that will help you begin to think about them in a rigorous way, but that's not the same thing as getting answers. You will learn how to write a philosophy paper, which is an incredibly valuable skill for all purposes and goals (writing logical, coherent arguments). Kagan is brilliant, but many people hate him. I happened to love him. Schmer.",
    "I think Life is a great intro philosophy class. If you've had experience in philosophy classes before, the material might not be as challenging as you would hope. But Shelley is, of course, a great lecturer, and the topics he covered were interesting.",
    "good lectures, tedious papers",
    "Philosophy can be so close to our lives, in this course.",
    "Perfect as a fourth or fifth Credit\/D course, especially if you've had no previous experience in philosophy.",
    "It was fun. It was easy. Writing the papers was fun. I didn't get much of anything out of it, though.",
    "Only if it is entirely restructured or offered as a seminar.",
    "Pretty good class. Don't expect any answers, but the questions raised are always thought-provoking, and Professor Kagan does a good job of working carefully and logically through the concepts. Standard Shelly Kagan warning applies - somewhat tough grading (at least by Yale standards), but if you actually think about your paper and don't try to fudge it the night before, you will do fine.",
    "Great class--it's not a lot of work (though not an easy A), but if you're at all interested in philosophy, take it. Kagan's a great lecturer, readings are usually really interesting, and I even enjoyed writing the papers.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT unless it could fulfill a requirement. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE.",
    "take it. it should just get better as Kagan works to tweak the class.",
    "Life comes with a lot of opportunity and is really what you make of it. Punning aside, that description is accurate. You'll develop a lot philosophically if you're willing to put the things you believe on the chopping block in section or by asking Shelly a question during lecture, and if you do that and really put time and thought into the papers (that's all you need to put in, you're explicitly told not to do research and cite \"famous philosophers\"), you'll get a lot out of this class, in terms of learning about some of the basic principles of ethics, learning how to think critically and analytically about the philosophy of the day-to-day, and personally by discussing with the people in your section and pitting your ideas against theirs to try and collectively figure out what theories seem most plausible to explain and either justify or collapse the gut instincts we feel when thinking about things like love, charity, friendship, career choice, achievement, and the place of morality. I would recommend this class to everyone. It's an excuse to think.",
    "A great class to take for a first time philosophy student (like me) or for an old pro. You should do all of the readings to stay up in the class, but the assignments are based on your own opinions and not the readings.",
    "I would maybe recommend it to an underclassmen without much exposure to college level reading or ideas. However, the material is pretty basic and straightforward, and the papers are graded unnecessarily harshly. I took it Cred\/D for a reason. I would recommend trying to find a better course that was a little more focused.",
    "Definitely, if you want to think about the biggest questions on living a happy life, take this course.",
    "The main questions of life and what the major philosophers think about them. A nice contrast to Kagan's \"Death.\"",
    "take death.this class was too broad, perhaps it will improve, it was his first year teaching the class.",
    "This class is an interesting philosophy course. It was the first one I had taken, and so I found I am not really of the philosophy-mindset, but I still appreciated the material. It was interesting to be able to think philosophically about everyday topics that affect our lives. At times, the material seemed to be somewhat forced (Why do I have to analyze why love is a good thing?) but overall, I appreciated the lectures. The papers are difficult to write - it's hard to think philosophically and come up with a great argument.",
    "OK-not as great as I'd hoped. Interesting subject, but strange to be lectured about things like the value of education, whether or not to work, the morality of having kids...not my favorite class.",
    "Overall, this is a great introductory philosophy course to take. There are 3 papers in total, and as I'm sure many of the comments have already stated, they're initially graded very difficultly. I started with a C+ on the first paper, got a B- on the second paper, and an A- on the last paper. I have no idea how Shelly is going to average this, but he does mention that if you show significant improvement, he basically drops the first grade. Take this course if you want a little bit of a challenge with your pillow talk, but if you want to play it safe and learn philosophy from the start, take Intro to Philosophy.",
    "Eh. It's cool, I guess.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Kagan is an incredibly engaging and interesting lecturer, and the topics lend themselves to great debates in section. The work load is also much less than that of other courses. And while everyone says Kagan is one of the toughest graders at Yale, he's also one of the fairest. Most people's grades improve from paper to paper, and Kagan will weight later papers more if the grades show improvement. Overall, I found this class to be a really engaging, unique intro philosophy course.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to any student.I was really excited to take a class with Professor Kagan, but I was dismayed to find out that his reputation exceeds his actual teaching by an astronomical number of units. In lecture, he did nothing but give vague gesticulations that conveyed very little to the audience.I was also shocked to witness Professor Kagan shouting at one of the TA's to get him \"his chair\" onstage, when one day it was mysteriously missing. He continued to shout at this poor TA until she left the room, in search of a chair.I find it highly ironic that he has done absolutely nothing to help society. I have never seen so much arrogance in one human being in my entire life, including Lil Wayne.On the bright side, section was awesome.",
    "It's an interesting, thought-provoking class, and actually fairly easy. The papers are tough but are the kind that come from your own thoughts instead of research, so as long as you can reason through your arguments in a clear way, you should be fine.Lectures are interesting, but not totally necessary--it's the discussion section that is valuable. It may have just been my particularly awesome section that makes me say this, though.Readings were interesting, but pretty much everyone I know stopped doing them after the first or second week--they usually didn't come up in lecture, and pretty much never in section...at least, not in mine.Don't expect to come away with definitive answers about life. Expect to come away with material for further reflection.Participate in section. The more you put in, the more engaged you are, the more you will get out of it.Don't be scared away by Kagan's reputation for being a crazy-hard grader. Unless I just became a brilliant philosophy writer without knowing it, paper grading was not super tough.",
    "A broad and continuous discussion of the significant aspects of what we might call a worthwhile life. I would recommend the class because it is very different from any other class you will take and allows for some really great discussions and causes you to think hard about the parts of life that you deal with on a daily basis.",
    "The course is a little uneven, since it's the first time it is taught, but some of the topics are very engaging and can provoke heated discussions. Some of the course readings are actually very fun. Shelly is a great lecturer and is very approachable.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course. You'll spend your time talking about love and friendship and morality, which seem like interesting topics. The readings will even make you believe that the material is interesting.However, because love and friendship have such individualistic definitions, writing about them in papers is really awful. Section is the most interesting part of the course, but even that often devolved into discussion about one person's definition of love vs. another person's. We were only able to reconcile those two disparate definitions by saying that love meant different things to different people. Imagine repeating that over 13 weeks of the semester. Also, it's not like Shelly adds much to the lectures themselves. He often just regurgitates your readings or he analyzes them by saying something that you probably could have come up with on your own if you'd given it five minutes (e.g. maybe the best career for you is one where you're intellectually stimulated and you feel like your work is meaningful. WELL DUH). It was very disappointing to see someone as brilliant and likable as Shelly approach such potentially interesting topics approached so haphazardly.One good thing about the class is that it's very little work, so if you're taking it credit\/D, it's easy to get by without doing much and without being intellectually stimulated.",
    "recommended, good work:gain ratio, meaning for the amount of work and time it requires you gain a good amount of knowledge\/thinking",
    "Take it CR\/D. It's laid back and interesting, forcing you to ask question you've meant to ask anyway.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It was my first philosophy class at Yale, and I think it was a great introduction to the subject.",
    "Don't take it unless you want a credit\/d\/fail class.",
    "Life is a philosophy course that tries to analyze a host of \"big picture\" questions. Topics range from how to choose a career, honesty, and the meaning of life. The work is manageable, but the grading is rather rough. Overall, a great Credit\/D class, provided lectures and the syllabus are refined for future students. Recommended with reservations.",
    "Great class. You get to think about lots of things that college students are thinking about. Hopefully you like being analytic. My best class this semester.",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! It's a fantastic smorgasbord of interesting, very relevant topics, and the lectures are brilliant and engaging. The grading standards are high and demanding, but will push you to be a stronger writer of philosophy papers, and the materials and lecture will make you think long after class is over. Take it!",
    "Good first philosophy class... take it credit d",
    "This was among the most disappointing classes I\u0092ve taken in seven semesters at Yale. If I came out of this class having gained any new insights, or even having been given markedly new ways to think about things, I owe that to my section leader and to my discussion section classmates, not to Shelly Kagan\u0092s lectures, about which I\u0092d previously heard so many good things. Professor Kagan seemed to have done very little preparation for this course; it was common to have him show up to class announcing, in some way, that he wasn\u0092t quite sure what he wanted to say on the topic of the day\/week.Beware. I certainly would not take this class if I could do my semester over again.",
    "I recommend this class highly - I loved it. Take a class with Shelly Kagan before you graduate. I really enjoyed that he wanted us, as students, to \"do philosophy\" - to come up with our own ideas on a given topic rather than just analyzing the ideas of other philosophers.",
    "If:Happiness = Reality - ExpectationsThen:Keep your expectations low, and you will be very happy with this course.",
    "Life is an examination of the relative value of various endeavors in the course of human existence. It's abstract, interesting, demands very little work or reading, and is strangely fulfilling. I would stop short of saying it's a productive class, but I think older students who are contemplating adult life may find it a worthwhile experience.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "The most interesting philosophy class you could find, but beware of the grades.",
    "I would not recommend PHIL 179 to another student. If you enroll any way, you might be able to find a way to enjoy it or get something out of it, but I think overall it will disappoint. I've only sat in on or watched online a few lectures from \"Death,\" but I would have much preferred to take that class from Shelley Kagan than \"Life.\" Before Fall 2009, \"Life\" had never been taught in a large lecture format before and it showed. The lectures were definitely not as well thought out as expected. The list of topics and how they were discussed were very much experimental. Shelley was very upfront about this in the first lecture, so I would encourage you to take him seriously if alludes to such a possibility during future shopping periods.I also found that a lot of the reasoning and argumentation presented in the lectures and readings rested on intuition which was frustrating. It was definitely difficult to know how much intuition could be used in forming arguments for the papers and how much would result in a weaker argument.Also, take it Cr\/D\/Fail if you do enroll.",
    "yes i would recommend this class",
    "I didn't actually learn anything or change any views about life, but it did force me to think critically and develop my ideas. The work isn't very burdensome because the readings are only meant to provoke thought.",
    "Yes. It's tons of fun, and will get you thinking about relevant stuff. Kagan's amazing. Some of the readings are interesting and relevant, some not so much, all are supplementary to the lectures, and not doing them results in nothing but less knowledge for the student. Go for it. Write a paper about the nature of love.",
    "The class has great hubris from the title alone. The discussions in section could have been so much more meaningful.",
    "Not unless they know that they enjoy thinking and writing like a philosophy student.",
    "Life is a class that should only be taken credit D.",
    "I just don't really think I am a philosophy person, which is why I didn't get as much out of this class as I wish I had. However, I would say that maybe this class is a good class for determining this.I would probably recommend taking his Death class first as it is more established.",
    "I would recommend this course. It prompts students to think about a variety of topics that are important in their lives. Shelly is a tour de force, the kind of professor that you come to Yale to learn from. Take it.",
    "I took this class as my first philosophy class and was very disappointed. Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations, but I did not feel that I learned many new ideas or skills from this class.",
    "This course is a fun segue into philosophy at Yale for someone who might not have taken it before. Although plenty of people got away without doing any of the readings (Professor Kagan often summarizes them during lecture and, at least in my section, the readings were not emphasized), I found them to be really engaging. Professor Kagan incorporated a lot of great philosophical texts with some really engaging psychology and news articles \u0097 when I sat down to do the readings, I often enjoyed them so much I felt guilty. Because of the nature of the topics covered (love, friendship, achievement, career, education, morality, deception, etc.), I found myself in self-reflection more than usual over the course of the semester. Not many classes do that for me in such a strong way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is curious about Philosophy. Its a great intro course.",
    "Eh, could have been a lot better. Kagan is interesting to listen to when he philosophizes but I don't know that I got anything particularly concrete or useful out of the class (though since this is not the goal of philosophy, I suppose it is an unfair standard to judge the course by). I would like to say that at least my arguing and analytical thinking skills improved but I had an awful TA so I don't think they did much. This was also the first time that Kagan taught the course so it was hard to feel like there was any sort of cohesion between the lectures. I did not feel like we went into any topic into enough depth, which was frustrating, but maybe Kagan will iron out the kinks by next year if he teaches it again.",
    "This is a great class! Don't be afraid of Shelly's reputation - if you put in the effort, you'll do well in the class. Talk in section and be sure to really discuss your paper with your TA before you start writing and you'll be fine. The class is 2 lectures a week and 3 5-page papers. Probably one of the fairest classes I've taken in terms of workload and grading. Lectures aren't necessary, but Shelly is so engaging you won't miss one. This is a class to take before graduating.",
    "I would recommend it for another student, I think the course has a lot of potential. I feel prof. Kagan learned a lot from the course and will make it into something great. Additionally, although i was disappointed with the course because it was not as good as I feel it could have been, I did enjoy it and was anxious to go each week. The readings were thought provoking and lecture was interesting.",
    "Readings are short and to the point; not much work - just three papers over the course of the semester; you can engage as much or as little in the class as you want; Kagan is a great lecturer but the topics he focused on this year (which was his first year teaching this course) were underwhelming and not particularly thought-provoking.",
    "It is often said that he is very harsh grader, but to be honest it is quite easy to do well in his class, as long as your writing is clear. He is a good lecturer. Don't hesitate to take this class out of fear of his grading. If it interests you, go for it.",
    "PHIL179 is a good introductory course for students interested in philosophy (and even those who are not). Even if the lectures aren't particularly engaging, they are worth attending for the sake of the discussion sections, which are fascinating and engaging forums for discussion of life and its questions.",
    "I would recommend Life to another student even if only to take a class with Kagan. He is a well known philosopher and is very interesting.",
    "Interesting paper topics but lectures are pretty boring",
    "Very interesting course that is, as Shelly says \"A lot of thinking and not a lot of learning\". I would recommend it to another student, it was one of the most engaging courses I have taken at Yale. Take it Credit D though.",
    "Yes! It was a very interesting class. Also, the grading is not as hard as everyone says--you just have to know the format he wants the papers in.",
    "If you are seriously thinking about majoring in philosophy or are slightly interested in the topic, you should definitely consider this course. It offers a basic understanding of one of many approaches to philosophy and it is also practical because it analyzes issues (love, achievements, career, children, etc.) that every person faces on a daily basis.",
    "Sure. It's fun. Keeps the rest of your classes in perspective.",
    "This was the first year this course was offered, and Shelly Kagan knows he has to tighten it up in the future, so it might be more structured the next time around. Nonetheless, this time felt pretty meandering. Mostly, know this: the class probably should have been called \"Well-Being,\" not \"Life,\" because it basically addressed the question of \"What elements of life are best for our well-being?\" The answers were pretty intuitive: love, friendship, a good job, charity. This led to some really interesting lectures (especially the ones on love and career), some less so. The course never talked about the big existential questions suggested by its title (What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? What is our purpose?), to its detriment.",
    "If you like philosophy, this is probably a great choice. However, if you are not passionate about philosophy and are instead trying to get a taste of Shelly Kagan's teaching, I'd recommend auditing the course and seeing what you take away form it that way. I definitely think he has a lot to teach, but some lectures are a lot better than others. Also, if you take the course, start it CR\/D\/Fail and switch to a letter grade if you do well after your first paper. It's really hit or miss for first-time philosophy paper writers."
