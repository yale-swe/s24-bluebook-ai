   "comments": [
    "This class was extremely small this year. Professor Marinov is knowledgeable and the subject matter is fairly interesting, so overall it's a pretty good class, especially since it didn't have sections.",
    "Yes, great course that covers the following topics: how to define democracies, connection between economic development and democracies, democracies vs. authoritarian regimes, electoral revolutions, how the international community affects the spread of democracy. The course had a couple short assignments that were not graded, a midterm and a final. I'd recommend this course. Professor Marinov is very knowledgeable.",
    "I would really reccomend this class if someone is interested in the concept of democracy broadly speaking, and how democracy plays out around the world. This class let me explore a lot of conceptual questions about what democracy really means, and then also forced us to look at practical issues arising with democracy and the attempt to promote democracy around the world. Serious amount of reading, but overall not a work-exhaustive course.",
    "Good class. Manageable reading, no paper, (closed-book) take home essays for midterm and final. A few occasional assignments, but not burdensome.",
    "I would recommend this course. The learning to work ratio is high, which is always best. The teacher is down to earth and the subject is really fascinating."
