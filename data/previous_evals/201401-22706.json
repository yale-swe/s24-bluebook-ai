    "i would tell a friend that it is a difficult course but professor will help you through if you need it.",
    "Yes, it's a must for all CHE students.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "It's a very difficult class, but if your research involves transport-related subjects, it's a very useful subject to learn.",
    "Would highly recommend the course, but would leave a caveat that it should be given at least 24 hours of work time a week to focus on (if approached without a background in this topic)"

   "comments": [
    "Transport phenomena is an important feature in every aspect of science and engineering. It is a good thing to be trained to think with this mindset, however specific examples covered in class are usually not representative of the research interests of the students.",
    "Yes.",
    "Not sure for now. But deepen my math background for sure.",
    "My research deals heavily with transport-related concepts. Learning transport approaches gives me a very important tool for my toolbox, something that I'll undoubtedly use for analytical research, and something that I use on a near-daily basis for understanding concepts.",
    "The course has no direct bearing on my research, but I will now consider fluid mechanics more closely when looking at my organic solar cell fabrication techniques (i.e coating and deposition methods)"
