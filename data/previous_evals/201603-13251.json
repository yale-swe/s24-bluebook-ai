    "Good topics and relevant information...presented in a very disorganized fashion.",
    "This is a terrible course that should honestly not be offered any longer. There is no sense of structure with respect to learning objectives. I walked away from this class learning very little, if anything, about clinical trials. The Professor Makuch seems completely uninterested in teaching the course and doesn't care about it or the students at all. He is a terrible teacher--every lecture was not only PAINFULLY boring but also unclear and not well taught by any standards. I essentially had to read the book and search online to complete all the homework assignments, which I could have done without taking this class. I cannot emphasize how truly terrible this class was in every possible way. This class could be improved by getting a different instructor to teach it, having a clear plan for what will be taught throughout the semester, giving more examples during lecture of how the statistics being taught are actually applied and used in different scenarios. Basically the whole course needs to be redone.",
    "Topics covered overlap with survival analysis while these 2 courses are all mandatory to BIS student.",
    "The class topics could be better organized.",
    "great class, very helpful given my interest in the subject.",
    "This class is very disorganized. Lectures were often repeated and homework did not reflect what was being taught in class. Use of more case examples of clinical trials would have been helpful in understanding the concepts taught.",
    "This course is useful in understanding the clinical trial fundamentals, but it's more like slide-reading class.",
    "A very important that fails to get its due",
    "Loved the class - Dr. Makuch is great!!",
    "Not very engaging",
    "Its contents are great and useful.",
    "Weaknesses: There is not a clear syllabus\/flow for this course. The course materials are taught randomly without a clear logic. In addition, the lecture notes are very messy with a lot of typos. I hope that this course can have a much clearer teaching goal, and please improve the quality of the lecture notes and homework assignments.",
    "It's good.",
    "You have to learn the material on your own.",
    "It was a useful course though a lot of the information is not in too much detail. Good for an introductory course but would recommend something more advanced for those interested in clinical trial studies.",
    "Good"

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He is an excellent teacher",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch is one of the worst professors I have ever encountered in my life. He seems completely uninterested in teaching this course. Every lecture was extremely boring and disorganized. He seemed to have no plan or goals for what was to be taught or learned during the course of the semester. He is just a terrible teacher and really should not be in the position to teach students at all and especially not statistics.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Prestigious",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a great instructor. Made this class extremely interesting.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0It's very valuable to learn not only the didactic elements of this course, but to also have access to Dr. Makuch's insights and stories. Thanks, Dr. Makuch!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The professor is a great guy but is not the most engaging lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Although Professor Makuch is a prestige researcher in the field, he is not an efficient instructor. As a professor, he did not care about his student. Firstly, the qualities of his lecture notes and homework assignments are poor. There are a lot of typos and mistakes in Prof. Makuch's lecture notes, and he did not care about them. Secondly, he did not show respect to his students during his lectures. It was common to see Prof. Makuch to talk in his mobile phone, pick up his friend, and disappear, during lecture time, and he DID NOT CARE about these behaviors. Finally, he often missed his office hours without any notices. It is really disappointed to meet such an irresponsible professor at Yale University. I understand that Prof. Makuch might retire soon, but if you are gonna to teach this course, then please at least show some respects to your students, to this course, and to this school.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Nice professor",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He is a good lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The professor doesn't care whether you learn or not. He is definitely not invested in the course, which is not exactly inspiring if you are a student.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very nice professor, thought a little bit hard to reach at times.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Prof Makuch is very knowledgeable and made me think about a lot of issues. I am much more interested in the subject matter than I anticipated.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Good"
