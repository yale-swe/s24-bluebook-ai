   "comments": [
    "I would say that this course is challenging but necessary for any graduate student in the Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry department.",
    "Very useful if you want to do biophysics\/structure stuff. Probably less interesting if you want to do other things.",
    "If you are an undergrad in MB&B and have taken Biochemistry and Biophysics, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It will be very repetitive except for NMR which is poorly taught.",
    "Hard, but recommended. Does the job of getting first-years on the same level.",
    "Yes. Many concepts taught in this course are necessary for research.",
    "MBB 720 is a class that gives you an overall understanding of different methods that can be used for biophysical\/structural research. I would recommend the course even though the course is a lot of work because you come out of it knowing a lot.",
    "It covers many biophysical methods and aspects of DNA, RNA and protein structure. There are weekly homework assignments, which take a long time and are difficult. I thought it was useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. It is a very difficult course, but you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend the other student to take a different class unless they are absolutely required to take MB&B 720. It was very, very difficult and not very rewarding. I do not feel that I learned very much that will actually stick with me through graduate school. I would tell the fellow student that MB&B 720 is a good idea for a class but that it is not taught as it is described.",
    "All said and done, this class was quite challenging but very valuable in the end, especially if one plans on working in this sort of field in the future.",
    "The course does a fairly good job covering the material of macromolecules. I would recommend it to another student, especially those interested in structural biology.",
    "Yes, this class is fairly difficult, but what you learn makes it worthwhile. Much of what I learned in this class, I wish I had learned more of in undergrad. It was a great survey of many methods and important structural and functional principles of macromolecules.",
    "Tough class but worth it",
    "It covers major macromolecule structure and function and key experimental techniques in the field. If you are a BBSB student, then it isdoable. If you are taking it as your elective, just don't.",
    "Yes. The material that is covered is incredibly useful to the field of biochemistry and biophysics. The instructors explain the material at a level that is understandable.",
    "It's required so of course.",
    "This class, from a professional standpoint, should be used to teach you what you find interesting and what you don't find interesting. If I could take it again, I would have put much more work in to things that I found challenging (but, to use the time-honored excuse, I had other classes to take, too!).Don't get frustrated if you don't know something - ask for help, instead. Most of the professors (read: all) are approachable after class, so look to them as resources. Additionally, TAs are helpful, too.But most of all, use the class as an opportunity to bond with your peers. There's agreat opportunity for that here, so don't be afraid."

   "comments": [
    "Very useful - I want to study more crystallography!",
    "Important building blocks to pretty much any thesis someone could write in MB&B.",
    "It was very helpful for understanding some of the background theories and methods that will serve to help in the qualifying exam and as I think about my projects.",
    "I would say the course definitely broadened my knowledge my discipline.",
    "This course significantly deepened my knowledge of the discipline.",
    "It didn't. All of the things I did well on in this class were because I already knew them from the past. I learned how to answer very difficult questions specifically for the exam but it was hard to actually gain useful information that would be applicable in my research.",
    "This course filled in many gaps in my knowledge concerning nucleic acids, xray crystallography and nmr. I think overall it provided me with a lot of very helpful information that I was use in the future.",
    "It taught me a very good deal on macromolecules which will be especially applicable to my qualifying exams",
    "The thorough review of biophysical methods brought back what I had learned in college and also added more to my knowledge. The lectures on macromolecular structure and function reinforced my existing knowledge and gave me a look at many phenomena in biology that I had not known about before.",
    "I learned a lot about some of the commonly used experimental techniques that I imagine will be really useful for the future.",
    "I now know what I should know, and that's a pretty good thing to know (I just wish I remembered from class - but that's up to me to correct this short-coming).Professionally, it was a great way to narrow down the topics in which I am interested professionally, and it was also a good way to learn more about the range of techniques available to biophysicists experimentally.There was not much opportunity to develop critical thinking - a lot of the homework was spent looking up questions and making tentative responses for an answer. However, part of that is part of research - uncertainty - and I think this course was a great opportunity to practice that (in a good way, mind you).I don't want to take it again, but I do want to keep learning about the techniques presented therein."
