    "Standard Spanish course. Don't take it unless you have to. Too much focus on silly readings. If you must take it, get Kevin Poole. He is awesome.",
    "Yes, but make sure you find a professor that you can spend 5 days a week with. Professor Poole is the greatest Spanish professor ever.",
    "I would recommend this class only with Professor Poole. He really brought the material to life.",
    "Only take it if you really want to become fluent or are filling requirements.",
    "I would say that Spanish 130 is basically a summary course, a way to review and master all of the earlier forms such as the present, past, and imperfect. This course made it possible to be able to understand most current events in the spanish news papers, have a normal conversation with a native speaker, and be able to appreciate the language."
