   "comments": [
    "You do end up learning a lot about Macro if you get a good TA, so definitely shop sections. Prof Fair said that this class tends to be harder than the average college Intro Macro class, as he tries to give us the \"whole picture\", some of which involves Intermediate Macro. Note that each lecture randomly draws students to present a current affairs, so if you want to push yourself to keep up with the financial news in Yahoo Finance, etc., this would be a great opportunity to do so. Also, I recommend taking Macro the semester after you take Micro while it's still fresh in your mind, as a lot of stuff is built on top of Micro and the class doesn't review that at all.",
    "If you must take macro, don't take it with Ray Fair.",
    "I would not recommend the class. The pace is slow, the material is boring and ray fair is not very engaging.",
    "A good introduction to the way that the macroeconomy works, but I would not recommend taking it to fill a QR credit or just because you're interested. You will regret it.",
    "A horrible class with Ray fair. Do not take it with him.",
    "You probably have seen his mostly negative evaluations on coursetable or ybb. During the first few weeks you will probably agree with these evaluations, but he gets better (only slightly, but still it counts). It's easy to lose track of what he says because he doesn't write anything down, just points everywhere on his poorly made slides (not even powerpoint, but just handwritten pdf files), so it would be better to study the night before and come to class to have the concepts reinforced. He has the most monotonic and somnolent voice ever, so get ready to be induced to sleep during the first weeks when you are not used to it. But he is funny at times, cracking some jokes during lectures. He also tends to deviate from the lecture and talk about things like women should marry younger guys (jokingly of course), which liven up the lecture but don't really help with your pset or exam. The exams are pretty fair; the final can be hard, but exams are all worded so poorly and weirdly. His psets are badly phrased too. But the textbook, written by him and his wife, is good.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to. It is an awful course and I hated every minute of it.",
    "If this is not a pre-requisite, no don't take it. Just buy\/rent the book and learn macro on your own.",
    "Econ 116 is a good introductory class to macroeconomics. I would recommend the class to anyone who is thinking of being an economics major, or just wants to have a better understanding of the US economy and how it works.",
    "Its a great class that I would highly recommend for people who did not like micro and who does not like math because the course depends on intuition.",
    "I mean, interesting content but it won't by any means change your life. Take it if you're interested or if you have to but don't sacrifice another class you'd like to take in order to sit in this room.",
    "This is a good class to take if you want to learn about the Fed and how the money, labor, and goods supply interact. Professor Fair is dull and paying attention in class is hard, but if you go to section and read the book, the class isn't too difficult. I would recommend not taking this class with Fair, but if you can force yourself to pay attention in class, you won't have too much trouble.",
    "A bad class but not as bad as people make it out to be. I would say take it but don't go to lecture. The exams are fair, problem sets are easy. Ray Fair wrote the textbook so you can just read it and everything is in it. Sections were useful and so were review sessions so go to those.",
    "If Professor Fair teaches this class again, definitely take it. You won't have a professor who makes more of an effort to connect abstract concepts to the real world, which is hugely valuable in an intro course. He's not super charismatic, but he's very clear.",
    "The textbook was extremely helpful and easy to understand. Overall I thought the course was a great review of macro. Ray Fair's lectures could be a bit more elaborative. After you take this course you will be able to understand all economic events that are going on. Great to have some perspective on current events. MAKE SURE to read the textbook to do well. Psets all come from the textbook so if you do the reading they are easy.",
    "Normally, if you're taking this course, it's because you have to. I enjoyed the material more than intro micro, but Professor Fair did not do a good job of explaining the material. My advice would be to read the book and go to section.",
    "You have to take it, so take it. TAs are a godsend-- I've never seen such well educated TAs that can actually teach as well as Peter and the others do. Fair isn't bad-- you won't learn a lot from him, but he's not a bad person. Too many people started to leave class after current events were chosen, so Fair had to do a new rule where he made current event talks in the middle to stop people from leaving class. It was actually kinda sad. TAs and Textbook teach everything, so learn from those. There are probably better teachers, but I learned anyway. The psets were graded basically pass fail so they weren't stressful, thankfully. Also more emphasis on conceptual ideas, not math, so that's something I'm also grateful for.",
    "Take this course if you want to begin understanding many of the topics and discussions presented on daily news. It really is insightful and interesting!",
    "Absolute horribly taught course that definitely hurt my education of economics. The lectures were not engaging or well organized at all. I had to rely on the TAs and the textbook for all my learning, which is just ridiculous. Professor Fair is seriously bad. I remember reading terrible reviews about him and thinking, oh he can't be all that bad. But trust me, he is. He has a monotone voice, unorganized lectures, essentially no lecture slides, is not engaging, and essentially just talks at you for 75 minutes. He enforces an attendance system to force students to attend lecture because he knows otherwise nobody would come because of how useless they are. I don't think Fair is a bad person but he is a perfect example of a brilliant man who cannot teach or doesn't put enough effort into teaching. Worst professor I have had at Yale and that's not an exaggeration.",
    "Plan to read every chapter in the textbook, as this is where your concrete understanding of the material will come from.",
    "Yes, if you have to take it.",
    "Useful, easy, rewarding.",
    "A decent overview into Macroeconomics with little in-depth analysis or real challenge. Its strength definitely lies in its TAs, who carry a lot of the weight in teaching concepts. The lecture itself is often very dry and confuses more than clarifies. The daily news announcements were interesting at first, but became a nuisance at the end of the semester when we were spending entire class periods talking about the news. I would recommend the class, but definitely not the professor.",
    "Quality course with real world application, definitely recommended.",
    "Even if ECON 116 01 is not a prerequisite for your major, definitely take it. You will be introduced to the most essential theories of macro economics--and finally be able to understand the newspaper(s) you are reading. If you have even the slightest interest in economics or politics, do take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "Don't believe all the mediocre reviews--this is a very interesting class. You do, however, have to put effort into paying attention, because Prof. Fair's voice is pretty monotone. Weekly work is minimal, and the things we learn actually apply to the world economy.",
    "not too bad either read the book or go to class",
    "Good intro survey for econ",
    "A major requirement, good to know how the economy works on the big scale",
    "Pretty boring but not too hard",
    "This class is an intro course to gain main ideas and knowledge towards how our economy works in theories.",
    "You learn a lot about economics and really applicable things. It is really useful to know for real world situations and current issues. There are psets once a week which are not too bad and a final and midterm. Class can be very long and sometimes confusing but the textbook is very helpful",
    "Good course. Interesting material.",
    "I think it is a useful subject, even though it is not the most interesting course.",
    "Econ 116 is an important class for anyone interested in the workings of both nstional and international economies.",
    "Econ 116 is a pre-requisite for a lot of popular majors, which is the reason why I took it. It's a general, introductory course to macroeconomics as advertised, and the course really does give you a deeper perspective and appreciation of how the economy works. If you take this lecture instead of the seminar, my only advice is to stay engaged and put in the extra effort to ask questions and read the textbook. Other than that, this was a pretty solid class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to students who are not interested in macroeconomics or who don't need this course to fulfill a major requirement.",
    "Classic introductory macroeconomics class.",
    "I have mixed feelings about Intro Macro. On the one hand, the material is very useful and applicable in a wide variety of settings. However, I found it hard to get engaged in the class. Professor Fair seems like a really nice guy but I personally had a hard time staying focused in his classes.",
    "Econ 116 is an introductory macroeconomics course that teaches you the basics of macroeconomics by applying theories and equations learned in class to current events and potential scenarios. It was really interesting to think about how government policies and spending influenced the economy as well as consumer spending.",
    "Econ 116 was a manageable course made much more difficult by lectures that were often much less than helpful. The TA's were it's saving grace",
    "As a standard prerequisite to a lot of other classes, it's definitely worth taking.",
    "Take it if you're willing to read the news!",
    "Econ major just take. Non-majors, u should also take this course to gain an overall understanding of our economy.",
    "This class is a relatively low key intro Econ course that offers a basic explanation of macroeconomics. The lectures can be a bit tedious but the work load is very manageable and the assessments are fair.",
    "ECON 116 is a pretty good class that gives an interesting overview of macroeconomics. I would recommend ECON 116 to another student. I really enjoyed class with Professor Fair, who tries to make the material as applicable to the real world as possible. While the class is of moderate difficulty, the exams and problem sets seemed fair. I spent quite a bit of time on the course, and reading the textbook was a helpful supplement to lecture.",
    "Eat your vegetables",
    "A dry and often boring introduction to macroeconomics, which depending on your TA can actually be both easy and interesting overall. Professor Fair is fun at times, but not a clear or engaging lecturer, so you'll mostly learn from your section and the textbook. Overall, a pretty easy course (not quite gut though), and I learned a lot. If Leora is available as a TA, make sure to take her section, as she is amazing.",
    "Would not recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Fairly dry. The second half (International Markets) is more interesting than Intro Micro and the first half of Macro. Fair's personal work is very interesting and well written, but unfortunately the lectures are less captivating. I would recommend the course for students with genuine interest in Macroeconomics who can pull it through without too much help from the instructors.",
    "Yes, it covers aspects of macroeconomics (interest rates, exchange rates, unemployment) that are important for anyone to know",
    "Ray Fair teaches too little too slowly whereas Aleh tries to cover too much too fast. So pick your poison I guess. Fair's a pretty clear lecturer and he's very smart, but his lectures were slow and pretty sleep-inducing (especially at 1pm). However you still have to go to them because even though most things are in the book Fair covers some bits that aren't, and his lecture notes are very minimalist and cryptic. Also he has a list of names and cold-calls on people. Very little work weekly problem sets graded solely on completion, one midterm and a final.",
    "It's a very important class to take because of very useful and necessary material. Lecture can be boring, so definitely go to section.",
    "An excellent course for anyone who is interested in how the economy works as a whole. It isn't mathematically demanding and the workload isn't significant. I would recommend it as it isn't too demanding and has a lot of useful information."
