    "H\/P is not at all history-based, but that is common knowledge. Professor Welsh will likely not be teaching this course again, but he is a tremendously interesting person, if not the most engaging section leader. Great stories, great feedback on writing. Most low evaluations of this class will probably be from people who didn't really figure out how to learn from Professor Welsh (I feel that I gained quite a bit). Also, readings are all pretty good, as usual for DS.",
    "Definitely take the course; we read so many important, interesting works that you've presumably spent your educated life hearing about. They live up to expectations, they really do. Appreciate Professor Welsh for his wisdom, wit, and writing advice, and be sure to try hard to bring up any points you have.",
    "The syllabus is as solid as the rest of DS; the lectures were fantastic. Unfortunately, Professor Welsh was a rather incompetent discussion section leader... classes were painfully slow and uninformative.",
    "If you did DS in the fall, you should follow through and complete the full year. You might want to look into transferring sections, however, because you won't get as much out of this one as others."
