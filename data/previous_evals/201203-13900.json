    "I really liked the class overall, but it was much too easy. I was expecting more involvement of microbiology. Some of the topics became quite repetitive, but it was an engaging class overall. There were times when the students' comments were irrelevant and would initiate random discussions that usually proved to be an ineffective use of class time.",
    "One of the main strengths in the interactive nature of the course.",
    "My only complaint is I think the syllabus and the emphasis on microbiology communicate an unwelcoming message to those not in EMD. I think this class would have been stronger had there been a more diverse representation of YSPH departments. However, the syllabus and first day of class seem to discourage that when in reality, it isn't the case. Also, this is a global health option and I think it is important that people in the global health concentration feel that they are able to take the class even if they are not in EMD. My understanding was the class was brought into the curriculum to strengthen the global health program, not to add another EMD class. Because of the class make-up, I felt that we couldn't really delve into all of the important aspects of WaSH in the developing world.",
    "One of my favorite classes.",
    "great perspective",
    "This has been one of the best, if not the best, overall class that I have taken at YSPH. This class really allowed us to express our opinions and discuss crucial issues in health focused around water and infectious disease. Dr. Talbert-Slagle is so in tune with and interested in what we as students have to say, she stimulates honest discussion, looks for ways to broker compromise, and fosters a collegial atmosphere in which it is possible to really assess, discuss, and suggest possible solutions to difficult situations.This was the first class in which the opinions of the students really seemed to matter and where people really were willing to share how they thought with one another. She is a tremendous professor and I will miss going to this class!Take it.",
    "I really liked this class, we had excellent discussions every week and I learned a lot from my fellow students",
    "Excellent course!!",
    "Overall the course was great. Discussions were enjoyable and allowed us to learn from each other.",
    "The teacher was always well prepared. I enjoyed being offered some input into the topics discussed during the final weeks. Overall, this was a very good course with excellent discussions.",
    "This may be my favorite class that I've taken at YSPH. Every week, I would be excited for Wednesday because of this class. Fascinating topics, nuanced discussion, and it challenges you to think about problems from multiple angles. I also appreciated the ability to steer the class based on student interest.",
    "The course was a good seminar covering many of the major topics in water access and sanitation around the world. The small class size made discussions productive and there was a lot of interaction with the professor."
