    "I would wholeheartedly recommend it. Your Korean will improve, especially your writing. It's also an enjoyable time and Professor Lee is a great professor. The workload isn't bad, usually a worksheet or two a day, though sometimes there can be a lot of writing. I wouldsay, however, that having a good knowledge of Korean beforehand is an advantage.",
    "It was amazing. It really made me interested in further learning Korean. It was very fun, because the students and the teacher had such a good relationship. Although it was every day in the morning, I really looked forward to it. The professor is great and very funny and patient. You have to put in the work though!",
    "-fairly rigorous course that builds up basic korean skills over a short period of time",
    "It is a great class and not too much work. Lee sunsengnim is funny and always high energy.",
    "It is a great course. If you want to improve your Korean you should take this class. You will learn a lot of Korean. If you are already really good at Korean, you should probably take the higher level class. The professor is amazing, because she makes the class fun and challenging.",
    "A great class for heritage speakers, even if the levels and strengths of the students vary greatly. You mostly build up grammar, spelling, and pronunciation geared toward heritage learners with the occasional essay. The class is also super fun - Lee-sunsaengneem connects a lot with her students and constantly cracks jokes in Korean. It would be nice if there were more reading passages that incorporated grammar patterns and vocabulary instead of learning by rote memorization. But overall awesome class!",
    "I would recommend Korean 132. It meets daily but the class time goes by pretty quickly. Make sure you stay on task and practice Korean everyday because there are lots of little quizzes periodically. You learn a lot in class in terms of grammar and will visibly see your Korean improve (both spoken and written).",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in learning about the Korean language and would like to improve.",
    "Funny, personable, maternal professor. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who places into it; learned a lot of basic grammar concepts that any speaker should have a good grasp of but that heritage learners often do not.",
    "It is a great class if you want to learn Korean, you will definitely improve. Because everyone's Korean skill level is difficult, it makes it difficult to track your progress since you cannot compare yourself to others."
