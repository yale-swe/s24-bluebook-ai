   "comments": [
    "The class focuses on the ideas behind what happened during the Cold War, so take it if you are really into theory and historical thinking and if you have a good handle on the basic facts and events from the Cold War. There is also a ton of reading.",
    "It challenges the Gaddis narrative of the Cold War, and it's definitely relevant to understanding the world today. Take it (except you probably can't, because he is leaving)",
    "I would recommend it. Not too much work and gives you a pretty good command of the history.",
    "I strongly recommend this class. Irwin is a great professor and the readings are very interesting. There are two short papers and a final paper, so the workload is manageable. This class provides a very different perspective on the Cold War than the Gaddis lecture.",
    "This course looks at U.S. and Soviet action in the 3rd world to see how in many cases their actions were catalyzed by developments in the 3rd world. It also looks at how both powers' views of the Third World evolved.",
    "A class about the 40s to 80s with a focus on the Third World, development, and decolonization\/UN, and how those themes fit into the Cold Warcontext (or do they?). People think about the 40s to 80s as the Cold War - big power politics - but a lot of other transformational changes are taking place. Is the Cold War the story of the second half of the 20th century or is there something bigger taking place?I don't think Irwin is teaching the class again but definitely take a class with him on decolonization before he leaves at the end of 2012.",
    "This class will challenge the way you think about post-WWII history. The readings are well chosen to do this but more importantly, Professor Irwin is able to guide discussions in such a way as to lead you to epiphanies. There is a bit more writing than in most classes, but the assignments are enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this for anybody. You learn a lot - a lot of really interesting readings. The essays are also fun to write. Professor Irwin has unique essay prompts.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The readings were interesting--a good mix of secondary and primary--and the discussions were particularly engaging. Irwin is a fantastic professor.",
    "Absolutely take a class with Professor Irwin. He is fantastic! The readings were also very interesting and made me think about the Cold War from a completely different angle."
