    "I learned an incredible amount from this course. The sheer number of hours I spent working on this project (probably around 300 - 400) this semester meant that I became a better, more experienced engineer. I also learned what it takes to take an idea from conception to prototype in a semester (a lot of dedication and work).",
    "Design process, product development, leadership, cooperation, mechatronics, rapid prototyping, engineering analyses.",
    "Team project skills",
    "How to work with a team to engineer an educational kit that fits a market need",
    "This class gave me an in-depth look into the design process, and is perhaps the most relevant class I have taken as an engineer. From this class, I have gained significant confidence that I can now close the gap between idea and product, and this has burst my horizons wide open. I am now more seriously any entertaining ideas I may have. This class, for me, was the missing link between my schooling and being a real engineer.",
    "This course helped me engage in the design process through a set of lectures that helped guide our overall project. By seeking advice from Glenn and Kevin as well as the rest of the 489 teaching staff, I learned how to think critically about how systems interact. In addition, I was able to experiment with several SolidWorks engineering analyses.",
    "I learned quite a bit about electronics, circuits and good wiring practices. I didn't learn much about mechanical engineering, as i just used what I learned from Bulldogs Racing to make the project. I also learned about the design process, decision making mechanisms and project management.",
    "I learned the design process from this course: how to turn a problem\/desire into a real-world thing. I also learned how difficult designing something from nothing is; it's hard and requires a lot of time and thought, and there's no way to make it easier.",
    "Learned about the design process, how to promote positive team dynamics, and how to leverage my specific set of engineering-related skills.",
    "The course used a semi professional design process to create, evaluate, design, and produce a mechatronics device over a period of 13 weeks. We learned strategies for idea generation and selection, and tools to use to improve upon a design like fmea and materials selection guides. This course also focussed on microcontrollers, though at a students pace."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Many of the lectures were quite good, especially by the guest lecturers, like Prativ. He helped show that engineering can be full of cool young people. I also learned a lot from Kevin and Glenna about electrical and mechanical design. Weaknesses: The Deliverables! These are just awful, no way around it. The problem sheets asked an absurd amount of work from the teams. Then the teaching staff would usually be cryptic about what they actually wanted. For example, they said that they didn't want us to spend more than 2 man-hours per person for the write ups. The first 5 or 6 writeups took us around 10-15 man hours each, trying to meet all of the requirements set on the problem sheets. Eventually we began to disregard some of the requests on the deliverables sheets, and our grades actually got better (?). The website contributed nothing to my experience, and was just an added level of work for us to keep up with. We spent so much time each week working on deliverables that it was truly difficult to find time to actually work on our project. This also led to a rift in our group, as not all of us were willing, i suppose fairly, to drop our other commitments to focus only on this course. For a person only willing to work 10-20 hours a week on this class, as opposed to the 40+ per week I did, they would make no contribution towards the final design or towards building the product. This class is crucial for a mechanical engineering education, and the structure needs to be seriously rethought. The reports simply were not a good way to judge our learning or progress. We had team meetings every week with the instructors, and I see no reason that we needed this as well as deliverable videos and reports.I understand that this was Madhu's first year teaching the class, and I hope he is willing to break the history of this class being an enormous time-waster and help build a class that can teach product design without heaps of red tape. Last, the enormous commitment required for this class was especially cruel during Senior fall, when we needed to be applying for jobs. This creates a literal prisoners dilemma in each team. If some teammates want to spend lots of time writing applications, or leaving school for out of state interviews, the entire workload is shifted onto their teammates. If all team members do this, everyone fails. In our group, both of my team members did this and I ended up spending every day in the CEID building the project all day, often by myself or with one other. This also made it just about impossible for me to apply for jobs.",
    "Strengths - Get to do real engineering design work, have all the resources of Yale engineering at your disposal, have lots of helpful teaching staff, get to practice presenting and writing about your work Weaknesses - Lots of reports that take time away from the project. Also an all-consuming class for the entire semester. We were pulling all-nighters halfway through the semester and never really stopped.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale. Students get to take ownership of their own projects and we get more dedicated than in any other class. The teaching staff always provided us with helpful feedback, guiding us without telling us what to do. I learned a lot about the design process, but also a lot of mechanical engineering concepts. I think the website and videos were unnecessary. All other deliverables were very reasonable. It was interesting to work towards the hard-to-define goal of making an educational kit. I think that defining a more specific\/technical goal (e.g. robot competition) would lead to technically superior final designs, but less interesting design processes and less variation.",
    "Good course in general. The high quantity and frequency of deliverables detracted from time to work on the project itself. I would have liked to see more in-class presentations on progress as opposed to the documentation-style deliverables, as that would better incentivize continued progress on the project, rather than focusing on a video or other distracting side project.",
    "Strengths: We were offered a lot of valuable resources and support from the teachers and staff. The financial support was also very appreciated. Weaknesses: We should have had more freedom to choose our project. None of us were really sure what a \"mechantronics educational kit\" even was. Limiting the senior project to this kit made me feel less inspired to create something awesome. The weekly deliverables in the form of reports took away from engineering and felt like boring, forced paperwork that often did not contribute to the physical project.",
    "This course is very strong in hands-on learning. Though there are continuous deliverables to keep one on track, every step from idea to product is entirely controlled by the teams. The teaching team is INCREDIBLY knowledgeable, and their input gives value at every step of the way. That said, this course is a great deal of work, and things can pile up if you allow them to. This course should revise the website component, which at times seemed rather irrelevant to the project, especially since no one outside the class could view it. I think the importance of maintaining a website would be better understood if we were able to share it with more people--it would also allow us to extend the reach of the great work done by Yale Engineering outside of the CEID (this was also the chief reason I enjoyed the video deliverables before they were suspended--they allowed me to share my project progress with many people outside of the course).",
    "The greatest strength of this course the flexibility of 489 teaching staff. The staff was very receptive to feedback that helped changed the format of the course. It was really helpful to reduce the length of the reports down to ~2 hrs\/person. This enabled us to determine ways we can use the report to help us move forward with the project. It was helpful to have more team meetings with the 489 staff towards the end of the term--however, to improve this course in the future, I think that more team meeting in the beginning of the year would be helpful.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is that I know far more about engineering than when I started. From selecting motors to machining parts to building circuits far more complex than MENG 390 or EENG 200, I feel more legitimate in saying that I am an engineer, not just a student who takes engineering classes. I also really enjoyed the guest speakers; it was a nice break from normal class and Prativ in particular inspired a lot of us that engineering is cool and not just a masochistic passion. The greatest weakness is that the class felt restricted through the limited scope of the project and the learn-on-your-own model. The restriction sort of limited the interest in the project. I am pretty sure that none of the projects will be taken beyond this class, as most of the class wasn't deeply invested in the mission of our projects. I also respect that a great deal of engineering is learning on your own, but we wouldn't have a project if not for all the help of Glenn and Kevin Ryan. It may be worthwhile to ask them what the most asked about topics were of the past semester, and dedicate some lectures explicitly to that.",
    "Strengths are the fact that you get to work closely with your friends that you spent ~3 years in engineering courses. You also get introduced to the design process, which is useful. The weakness is perhaps is that the course doesn't have a good focus or vision, and honestly the project theme could have been a bit more exciting. There is also way too much emphasis on reports an videos etc to the extent that it precludes teams from doing the actual design an engineering. Also it doesn't help that the assignments are not well defined an causes a lot of headache just trying to figure out what we are supposed to do.",
    "The course is good in that it walks its students through the entire process of conceiving and making something from nothing. This is the real strength of the course: the methodical approach to teaching the design process. Most of the process\/lessons are intuitive, but having the framework of a college course around the semester-long project is helpful in keeping students on the right path\/pacing. The main weakness of the course is that the assignments (due apart from the project itself) were often tedious and unhelpful. Certainly many of the things required in the assignments were directly applicable to our project and kept us on track, but there was still a lot of extraneous work that was only completed for the sake of assignments. This slowed down our progress on our projects and frustrated us with respect to the course and teaching staff.",
    "Incredibly well taught course. Engaging and exciting. Workload can be a bit high, but seems inevitable when satisfying ABET requirements. I was not an ABET student, and still loved this course. One of the best I have taken at Yale. TA's were AWESOME.",
    "The course could be improved in three ways: (i) more time and teacher engagement at initial idea creation and selection, (ii) better team selection process, (iii) continuation of teaching staff, (iv) examples of successful projects. The idea that your team settles on should be exciting and fit the description of the class. Having a mentor on hand who has witnessed many projects succeed and fail and has a unique interests could offer great advice and ask careful questions that would help direct the creation and selection of an idea. Working with a team can be hard, but it's even harder when members of the team aren't interested in the class. In a required course like 489, one that draws from a diverse group of students, some students take the class do so because they are required to, not because they want to. This means that there are students who don't buy into the class and do the least amount of work in the easiest way to achieve a satisfactory grade. A process that can match students with similar levels of commitment so that less interested students don't benefit from the hard work of more interesting students, would be great. The head teacher leading the course seems to rotate year to year. This means that every year 489 is taken in a new direction. Suggestions made by students and insights learned by the professor are harder to implement the following year because the head teacher can relate to the experiences of the previous class and thus can't fully understand them. To really improve the course, 489 should be taught by the same core teachers for at least 2 sequential years. ENAS 118 might be a good example of how a course can grow and develop if the head teachers remain the same over a multi-year period. The teaching staff taught the course with the goal that the devices we developed could in fact be used to solve a real problem, yet this always seemed like a bit of a gimmick. If the teaching staff actually had these goals in mind something needed to be done to convince us that they meant what they said and that this was actually possible. Potential solutions are: show us previous projects that have gone beyond yale, provide an easy pathway (like meetings?) with educators that might be interested in solving the problems the teaching staff based the course around."

   "comments": [
    "The only reason you take this course is because you want an ABET degree, so you have no choice. A couple hints to make it less painful: Don't let the teaching staff convince you to make your project more complicated. While Madhu grades the deliverables, he didn't write most of them. He is interested in interesting, detailed content, showing critical thinking about design, and not in your formatting being perfect or you hitting everything that the deliverable sheet asks about. Be prepared to pull all nighters. Make sure that your entire team is on the same page with work contributions. In most groups, there is a wide range of commitments, and this always makes problems. Best of luck: this is going to be your life for a semester, so make the best of it and become good friends with your teammates and classmates.",
    "If you are ABET, congratulations! You're taking this course. If you are not ABET, think very hard before taking this class over another project class because the workload is much more than any class I have ever taken at Yale (which include all the classes in the ABET Mechanical Engineering major, most of the pre-med classes, and four semesters of mandarin). You will learn a lot in this class but will also work very hard. You have been warned.",
    "The toughest, most time consuming, but most rewarding class I have taken at Yale. The more you invest in this class the more you will get out of it, and there are barely any bounds on how much you can get out of this class. This course is like a practice round before you become a \"real\" mechanical engineer, and I'd definitely recommend it!",
    "Bottom line is that if you are wavering on whether or not to take this, you should strongly consider taking it since you will learn a lot, but pay attention to who is teaching it, and don't take a massive courseload outside of this class. This year it was taught by Madhu and Beth; Madhu apparently won't be teaching this again until 2019, but when he does, that year's seniors will be lucky! There was a theme given for the projects - \"mechatronics educational kit\" - but beyond that we had free reign, and everyone's projects were quite different. The class certainly wasn't perfectly organized - for example, there was a lot of miscommunication about expectations for assignments - but I trust Madhu and Beth to really consider any feedback they've received about how to improve the course. Also, the teaching staff are pretty understanding when things beyond your control interfere with your productivity. Kevin and Glenn were extremely helpful with the nitty gritty details of implementation, and the TAs, Ali and Walter, were the bomb. As with most project-based courses, the most frustrating part is mismatches in enthusiasm\/effort within your team, since teams were assigned by the teaching staff, but I think to some degree that's inevitable.",
    "This is a good project class; there are not many involved, hands-on projects in the major. However, it is an absurd amount of work, approximately equivalent to 2 or 3 mechanical engineering classes. Likely not worth it unless you are ABET (and have to take it) or if for some reason you have tons of time or an extra Credit-D class. If you are ABET, try to take it with the lightest other course load you can.",
    "In this course you will complete an engineering project with a team. You use a lot of the skills you've gained throughout college and apply it to a real, entrepreneurial concept. We were required to develop a unique mechatronics educational kit. Be prepared to work a lot of hours outside of class time. There are deliverables almost every week, often in the form of reports.",
    "If you are an ABET major, you will have to take a design course. If anything, I would recommend this class over Medical Devices or the other choices simply because of the teaching staff. The professors assigned to this course were some of the most intelligent, attentive, and helpful professors I have had the pleasure of working with in my entire Yale career. This course's deliverables take you all the way through the design process in a way that truly elucidates it. Though it is a GREAT deal of work, this course will inspire you as an engineer, and contains some of the most valuable information and experience you will gain at Yale.",
    "This course is a requirement for the ABET MechE degree. It is more focused on design and implementation (as suggested by the title) than the other CEID design courses. For students simply interested in a design course, I would recommend first having experience with other CEID design classes before looking into 489.",
    "As of Fall 2016, ABET Mechanical Engineering majors are required to take this course; if you are BS12 or below, I strongly advise NOT to take this course and instead opt for Medical Device Design or another design course for your senior project. If you are ABET, I'm sorry that you're here, but hopefully this review will advise you the best it can. In previous years, students would be assigned to different groups and allowed to choose their own project. This year, Madhu, the professor for MENG 390: Mechatronics, and Beth decided to make the project the same for everyone: a kit for mechatronics education. In addition to the conflict of interest, it is limiting to be restricted to an educational kit, especially for a class that is historically used for the senior project requirement. If the class uses this same format again, I strongly recommend considering what will impress employers and\/or graduate schools when designing the project, rather than what may be the most effective for its actual purpose. The rest of the semester is a combination of working on the project while also submitting deliverables each week. Although the length of the deliverables has apparently been cut down compared to past years, they can still take many hours to complete and can be more time consuming depending on the topic for a given week. Often, it felt like we weren't working on the project but instead making just enough progress to complete the deliverable for a given week. The deliverables are the grade, whereas the project sometimes felt like just a result of meeting each deadline until the very end. The deliverable feedback also often not clear and proved meaningless, and the next deliverable would be completely unrelated. The most challenging aspect of the class is learning practical engineering skills, highlighting a deficiency in the engineering department as whole. Unless you've done Bulldogs Racing or YUAA, you'll need to learn a lot on the spot--motor selection, advanced electronic components, etc.--and the lectures in class don't address it, instead focusing on intangible things like intellectual property and engineering safety. In this respect, Glenn and Kevin Ryan are the class's greatest assets. Their knowledge of mechanical systems and electronics respectively was essential to all of the projects. I've learned more about practical engineering from these two, as well as some of the more experienced students, than I have in all my other engineering classes combined. On the other hand, Madhu and Beth felt more like supervisors and were not intimately involved in the projects, especially Madhu as he is very busy. My last warning about this class is time. This class will take up the bulk of your time; for me, this class was more work than my other four classes combined. The combination of deliverables, building, and troubleshooting adds up; plan to make this class the priority. As a final note, I learned more about actual engineering than I have in any other class and created a project with my team that I feel proud about. However, the deliverables of the class can feel overwhelming at times, and you will need to figure out the majority on your own or by asking Glenn or Kevin. A time intensive course, MENG 489 is a rite of passage for ABET Mechanical Engineering at Yale. Best of luck.",
    "If you are abet you ll take it. If you are not stay away, and take a Joseph Zinter course.",
    "If you're ABET Mech. E, you have to take this. Add to worksheet and move on. If you are some other Mech. E major, think hard about whether you want to take this course, and talk to people who have taken it. You'll get a hands-on experience with the design process with the methodical framework of the course guiding you, and you will complete you senior project. However, you will also have to put in an ENORMOUS amount of work. So much work. A significant portion of that will not be directly towards the completion of your project, either. You'll have to write reports, make videos, put on presentations, etc. for the sake of the course, and it will feel like spinning your wheels\/waste of time sometimes. Still, you will learn the design process and will understand much better what it means to be an engineer after completing this course. Those are the pros and cons. Now you make your decision.",
    "Take this. If you are interested in MechE and design, take this. if you want a course to tie together what you have been learning for the past 4 years, take this. That being said, I was lucky enough to get placed into a great group that worked really well together. Other students may not have had such a good experience based on their specific group dynamics.",
    "Take the course if you are interested in this team based project course but be aware that you are probably taking this course with students who would rather be else where."
