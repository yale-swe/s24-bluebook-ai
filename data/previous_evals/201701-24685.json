    "I LOVED THIS CLASS. Prof. Yaver taught us so much about the courts, but it was always in such a fun way. I would go to class super early every week just because it was so fun. Usually I loathe participation, but the participation aspect was great because it got you to interact with the material. However, the readings were often unnecessary. The grade breakdown was fine. I will say the class was a little too back-loaded, and the final paper was SUPER long, but all of it was enjoyable and fair. Great class!",
    "I now thoroughly understand the Supreme Court as an institution, along with theories that help explain their common functions: granting cert, assigning opinions, and writing them. I also understand the guiding motivations of the actions of, and interactions with, the other elected branches and key unelected institutions. I also better understand the details related to a small selection of landmark cases in the Court's history, along with how the media covers the Court and its procedures.",
    "I took a lot out of this class about how the media interacts with the American Judicial system. By covering theories both about the supreme court as an institution, as well as, the role the supreme court plays for the public, I gained a lot of knowledge that I can apply to most of my political science curriculum."

    "Usually I loathe participation, but the participation aspect was great because it got you to interact with the material. However, the readings were often unnecessary. The grade breakdown was fine. I will say the class was a little too back-loaded, and the final paper was SUPER long (maybe either a final paper or final exam), but all of it was enjoyable and fair.",
    "I appreciated how the lecture managed to be inclusive, intimate, and participatory. A lot of valuable questions were raised, allowing for input from students of all political persuasions. I would ask that some of the work shifts a bit forward in the semester, particularly the shorter papers, for a lot of work was jammed into the month of April.",
    "Strengths of this course include interesting lectures and reading, as well as, discussion questions and essays that allow students to engage with material but put our own spin on. No weaknesses I can think of.",
    "Strengths: Lots of applicable reading, fair workload, interactive, teacher was knowledgable Weaknesses: Not very well attended, early in the morning, sometimes felt a little unorganized, lots of PowerPoint material"

Usually I loathe participation, but the participation aspect was great because it got you to interact with the material. However, the readings were often unnecessary. The grade breakdown was fine-- 10% participation, 2 10% short papers, 35% final exam, 35% 12 page final paper. I will say the class was a little too back-loaded, and the final paper was SUPER long, but all of it was enjoyable and fair. Great class!",
    "Yes! If you make the effort and have any interest in how and why the Supreme Court does what it does, you will come to understand the Court's role in American politics and society at large. The short papers simply allow you to expound on some of the more divisive questions from lecture, and the longer paper allows you to analyze a Supreme Court case from the frames of three key judicial decision making hypotheses, in addition to media's coverage of it. The long paper was very insightful, even for some of the best known cases. Anyone who criticizes Yaver for showing her liberal colors must remember that she taught this when Trump was elected, and much of the content made itself, such as his unconventional challenging of the integrity of well-respected judges and a threat to break up the 9th Circuit, among other embarrassing examples of attacks on judicial legitimacy.",
    "Courts, Media and Politics was a really interesting class about the Supreme Court. A lot of material covers the Supreme Court generally, and theories about the justices, but there is a little at the end about the Supreme Court in relation to the Media. Pretty easy workload, readings not necessary to do as lectures bring up the main points, long paper at the end was kind of long but interesting and easy, and the final was set up so we had a study guide in which the Professor picked the essays questions from. Overall very good class!",
    "Yes! Professor Yaver is so great and makes the topic so approachable. I rather enjoyed her way of teaching and how it involved a lot of student participation even though it was a lecture.",
    "This is a class that focuses on two primary areas: the ways that justices reach decisions in the Supreme Court, and how the media covers the Court. The class started out with about 40 students on the first day, but ended up with about 12 students taking the final exam, and 6-7 showing up to class on a regular basis, which made the lecture style course a little bit awkward. Professor Yaver was very knowledgable on the subject and her research is in this area, but her ideology is generally infused in the course material, and the class seemed slightly unorganized at times, although that may be a result of the Trump administration making some decisions that involved the Supreme Court. If you want Con Law, take the Con Law class. If you want another \"pre-law\" type class, take Bioethics. But if you are Political Science major that focuses on media interaction with the government, or the inner workings of the Supreme Court, then this class is worth shopping."
