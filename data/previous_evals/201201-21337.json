   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you need to, otherwise, live you life. cherish it. for the love of god cherish it.",
    "Terrible class. Moscarini usually teaches the theory course, and it seemed like he didn't realize this was a different class.Pointless formulae, would never have taken it if not a requirement.",
    "Yes, especially if you're an econ major.",
    "if you're not an econ major just stick with intro macro- you dont learn anything new in this class.",
    "I wish I had taken this course with Nordhouse as I hear that students from that class come to love Macro. This class has just made more frustrated with Macro as a discipline than I was before.",
    "Do not take this class 9am. Otherwise, you learn a lot.",
    "Difficult. If you're taking this class you've already made it to far into the major so you have to take it regardless.",
    "The class builds on Intro Macro. It's better because FINALLY, econ seems to get more realistic; you build models that aren't based on the most ideal conditions. The workload is less than Int. Micro by quite a bit, but some concepts are trickier than I realized. The class also had a bunch of super intense Econ majors (taking in the spring as opposed to the fall) so the curve's tricky I think too. Moscarini's a great guy, but lecture can be dull. Just do the reading, do the problems sets (which were sometimes pretty interesting), and go to lecture. You'll be in a way better place with just that than you realize.",
    "Very dry course. If you have to take it, take it with Nordhouse in the fall. Topics that I thought would be covered that are less theoretical and more applicable to real world economics suck as international trade, exchange rate, amongst others were skipped which made the class less exciting.",
    "Starting with material covered in Intermediate Micro,the course builds up to a complete overview of closed-economy macroeconomics. The textbook for this course is great, and lectures more or less stick to the textbook. The exams were pretty challenging, but Professor Moscarini's expectations for our class seemed to be a little above our performance. Expect a fairly easy course with tough grading on exams. If you want to do well, review closely and frequently right from the start.",
    "Don't take this shit",
    "I would only recommend you take this if you need it as a requirement. Be prepared to be a little bored at times. If this class is at 9am again then you better be ready to skip a lot of classes because hearing about these models that early in the morning is quite the painful experience.",
    "Take it if you have to, but I wouldn't say this is a class to take for fun.",
    "Take it if you are comfortable with math and are interested in the material.",
    "Good",
    "You're probably taking this course, because you need to. Most people seem to take it in the fall with Nordhaus, but I quite liked the smaller class size. It made things easier to understand."
