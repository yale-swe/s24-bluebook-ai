   "comments": [
    "This class is very straightforward and engaging. You get a comprehensive overview of research methods that you're bound to use throughout your career.",
    "This class provided students with a comprehensive overview of research methods in Psychology, including guidance in developing research proposals and identifying flaws in research designs. Although Professor Baskin-Sommers used examples from Clinical Psychology to illustrate principles, the principles of the course can be applied to any type of Psychology research. Professor Baskin-Sommers provided clear, concise information about research methods that was immediately useful in my other Psychology courses this semester.",
    "I learned how to analytically approach research papers and better understand what researchers need to go through when thinking about a research design and composing their papers.",
    "I learned how to conduct and criticize psychological (and just general) research in a proper manner.",
    "In this course, I learned a variety of concepts that allowed me to eventually read and evaluate a research paper critically. The kinds of concepts I learned from validity to ethics gave me a new way of reading research papers . These concepts also helped me to understand the papers more easily as I was able to comprehend the complex terminology used in the papers.",
    "I learned essentially everything that goes into conducting psychological research, whether it be evaluating current research or developing my own.",
    "Through taking this course I've gained insights into designing research and critically evaluating existing research.",
    "A deep understanding of research methods",
    "I learned to critique research and to develop, explain, and evaluate my own research designs using different components such as control group design, sampling, statistical methods, observational vs. experimental design, etc.",
    "Through this course, I learned how to critically evaluate research studies, as well as how to design a study of my own. These lessons have extremely practical applications for anyone involved in psychological research, but they are also quite valuable for any student who wants to be an informed consumer of reports on research in popular media.",
    "By taking this course, I learned all about the process of psychological research, from choosing variables, to the peer review process, and everything in between. This was not only incredibly useful for conducting empirical research, but also for simply reading and evaluating scientific studies. Now when I read a paper, I am better able to judge it, and determine whether it was a well conducted experiment, or whether I should be weary of the results. This class will definitely help me in all my other psychology classes.",
    "I learned a good amount about how to make my research less sketchy. To be honest, lots of this stuff is sort of common sense, so it was mostly just learning the term for something that you already know. However, the final project was actually pretty useful because it requires that you find a gap in the literature and design a project to address it, which is super relevant for anyone who plans on going into research later.",
    "This is an AMAZING intro to what goes into doing research really helpful in determining what you want to do with a psych major!",
    "I learned a lot of important research vocabulary and the necessary processes involved in designing a good study. Most importantly, I learned how to critique the way research is disseminated through popular news outlets, and how to control for different threats to validity.",
    "You learn how to carry out each step of research.",
    "I have a much better understanding of research methods in a concrete way and can now systematically evaluate research I come across academically and in daily life.",
    "Definitely learned alot about research methods language and terms. I also have a much greater respect for the amount of thought and work that goes into developing a study before the data collection stage even begins.",
    "This course effectively taught me concepts necessary to being able to critically evaluate research on a general scale, and also specifically in the context of modern clinical psychology.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of how to conduct psychology research and how to critique the research I read. I learned how to hone in on a research question, how to find and critique relevant studies, and how design the proper methodology for a research question.",
    "Definitely learned a lot in this course. It was a good summary of the main parts of psychology research. We also went into a good amount of detail in the topics.",
    "I learned the proper ways of critiquing research and conducting research."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very straightforward, clear communication and directions given on how to complete all the assignments. Lots of helpful review session prior to exams. Weaknesses: participation was required, but there were few intellectually challenging ways to contribute in class. Most of the \"participation\" was just regurgitating our notes or what was on the slide. Not particularly motivating.",
    "I thought the information was presented clearly and the examples throughout the slides helped. The lectures were very organized. I wish there was more guidance with the reaction papers. I also thought that the amount I studied the material did not translate well to my scores on the exams, so that aspect was frustrating for me. I wish there was more content tested on the exams so that each point or part would not count for as many points - I felt like when I missed one part, I would be largely penalized for it and that aspect was just not very reflective on how much effort I put in toward studying.",
    "The strengths of the course is how structured it is and how organized it is. Students are made very aware of what will be on each exam, what is expected of them, and how they can approach the materials. There is a ton of help available when you ask for it, and the timeliness of the responses to requests for help have made all the difference in the course. I did not see any critical room for improvement in this course.",
    "Some of the content seems to be somewhat unimportant to the actual practice of research, especially in the first half of the semester. Many of the concepts are really important, but the details are less so (e.g. knowing the details of every type of construct validity). Perhaps more time could be spent working through specific instances of research and criticizing it. The course does this in lecture, but the exams seem less focused on practical research criticism and more on knowing what things are called. Arielle Baskin-Sommers is a detailed lecturer and is eager to explain the concepts really well, but I think some of my concerns could be alleviated if she made it clearer why some of the nuanced distinctions actually matter for the practice of research. I am not convinced all of them are.",
    "Well organized and thorough. Thoughtful emphasis on applied skills over memorization.",
    "This course is very dry by design--a lot of the topics unfortunately are not super interesting, however Prof. Baskin-Sommers did a fantastic job in trying to make it as engaging as possible by presenting current research as examples of a lot of concepts as well as employing things like jeopardy and design wars to test our knowledge.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers makes boring material interesting and fun!",
    "Strengths: essential for designing and developing own research questions and designs; i.e. if you want to do research, this class or another one in research methods is necessary. Information was well explained; lectures were organized and straightforward Weaknesses: a bit dry, but some lectures were funny",
    "This course teaches extremely valuable and practical skills. Although it is inherently quite technical (i.e., many terms to remember, theoretical discussions of research design), this particular version of the required research methods class presents this information in the most interesting way possible. The professor also made sure to make the information relevant to daily life for those in research and others.",
    "This course laid out all the processes of research clearly and understandably. Each part of the research process was covered, pros and cons were discussed, and as shown through real examples. It was incredibly clear, easy to follow and very applicable.",
    "Arielle is an absolute star, the only weakness is that the material is just rather difficult and dry, so it requires a lot of focus no matter who is teaching.",
    "The course material is very clearly introduced and explained; the lecture slides are incredibly detailed and Arielle makes sure to include a lot of examples, which help you understand some of the more difficult vocabulary\/concepts. I can't really think of any weaknesses except that the course material is kind of naturally dry...I think Arielle and the TFs are aware of that, though, and really do their best to make it as engaging as possible.",
    "Arielle is a cool professor. I would take it with her. Workload isn't too much. The assignment that took the longest was the final research proposal. You don't have to conduct any research, but you write a grant proposal based off every step of research methods you learned this semester. It could be no more than 12 pages.",
    "This class is very well organized, and I was impressed by Professor Baskin-Sommers' lectures, which often managed to be engaging despite their dry material. The focus on applying the material rather than just learning it is a huge plus, and makes this course much more interesting and ultimately satisfying. Furthermore, this course never makes learning less fun or more difficult than it needs to be. The class had a relaxed but focused vibe. The course also did an impressive job of covering a large amount of material that is practically useful. One weakness of this course is the ambiguity of much of the material. It often felt like we were categorizing terms and ideas in ways that didn't fully make sense. Some distinctions seemed like false distinctions that were only vaguely differentiated by hand-wavy explanation.s Real-world situations seemed to not always fit neatly into the categories taught in this course (for example, with threats to validity), which made it stressful when we had to try to fit real-life examples into these categories on exams. Sometimes definitions or categorizations that we learned in class did not align with common definitions and categorizations found online, which was frustrating. I imagine that much of these issues are due to the fact that research methods in theory are different from research methods in practice, and Professor Baskin-Sommers works from the perspective of an experienced, hands-on researcher. Nonetheless, it made for some frustrating situations when trying to really nail down certain concepts.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers always presented the material in as engaging a way as possible and gave us multiple avenues of asking for clarification. The assignments were clear and supplemented lecture material really well. Personally, I didn't get much use out of getting CITI certified because I don't plan on conducting psych research with human subjects, but that's just a personal preference.",
    "Strengths for this course include the instructor, who is very knowledgable and entertaining; engaging activities for reinforcing concepts including competitions such as \"design wars\" and jeopardy-like review sessions; and a reasonable, spaced-out workload. Weaknesses include the lack of emphasis placed on the textbook readings, which I found very helpful; I believe the course would benefit if the materials covered during lectures were matched more explicitly with the corresponding sections of the textbook (e.g. specific page numbers), which although very informative can also be very dense and tedious to read through.",
    "I think a major strength of the class was the ability to apply what we were learning to real life situations through the short papers. The in-class preparation for exams was also very helpful, as was the inclusion of examples in every lecture. I did not realize there was a Q&A feature on Canvas until the day of the first exam, so future classes may be improved by really making use of that.",
    "The weekly lecture power points were very thorough. I loved Design Wars. The Jeopardy review game we would do before each exam was also nice and reinforced topics. I thought the response papers were graded a bit harshly, but the feedback received on them was good. The two exams were fairly straightforward although I did a lot better on the first one. The final paper was fine - not difficult to do if you paced yourself. The TFs and professor were great about answering questions.",
    "The course was well organized and focused on core concepts, which made it easier to understand said concepts."

   "comments": [
    "You have to take it if you are a psych major. As research methods courses go, I would say this is a relatively painless one. Arielle is a great professor who makes a boring topic more lively. The course itself is relatively simple as long as you study for the exams and don't write papers at the last minute.",
    "I think if the student was interested in research and understanding the aspects of research methodology, or questioning whether or not they would enjoy clinical psychology research, this would be an important course to take. I realized after this course that research was not the right field for me.",
    "It's required for Psychology majors to take research methods but I suggest Research Methods in Clinical Psych because the material, although generally dull, is made interesting by really cool studies.",
    "If you are a psychology major needing a research methods credit, this course is fantastic. Professor Arielle Baskin-Sommers is AMAZING at both her knowledge about the concepts introduced in class and at helping the students really understand the concepts beyond their textbook definitions. The concepts themselves are also very interesting. I did not know I would like clinical psychology stuff, but this course really allowed me to appreciate the work that goes into the research in the field. The help that is provided is fantastic, and I never had to wait more than 12 hours for a response on a question (the Professor and TFs answer questions all the way up until right before the exam). The exams are fair and easy if you really study the materials and go to lectures to hear the examples in class. The concepts and exams are hard if you only know them by definition and do not know how to apply them to real-life clinical research situations. There are also two reaction papers, which are easy to do if you keep up with the class. The final paper is really interesting and fun to just apply everything you learned throughout the semester into a 10 page paper. In all, this is not a gut class, and you are wrong to assume that you can pass with an A without putting in the work. The class is uncurved, so if you're looking for a easy A, this is not the place to be. But if you want an academically challenging yet fascinating class, definitely take this class.",
    "I took this as a requirement for the Psychology major. I am on the neuroscience track, and this seemed like the easiest option offered this year. I took it over PSYC 270 because Arielle Baskin-Sommers seemed like a really interesting professor who was very accessible and because of its focus on human psychology. However, I am not sure if my time would have been better spent in the other course. A lot of the material seems to have been constructed because there wasn't enough content to teach specifically about clinical psychology. It wasn't always clear why the details we were expected to know were relevant to the practice of research.",
    "Best research methods to take by far. Research methods can seem rather dull, but the concepts are important and Arielle puts a lot of emphasis on applying critical thinking about research methods to current literature.",
    "I wouldn't say to take this unless you have to, it is very oriented towards psychology majors and is not super interesting otherwise.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers makes boring material interesting and fun! She's a great professor and this course is great!",
    "This class pretty much taught how to come up with and develop your own research question, and how to design an experiment\/study according to the question. Since I knew close to nothing about experimental design\/research methods, it was incredibly informative and helpful, especially if you are working in a lab or want to work in a lab or do research in the future.",
    "Absolutely! A version of research methods is required for all Psychology majors, but this class would be useful for anyone who reads about psych studies in the news. The professor makes the information as engaging as possible and ensures that students are able to apply theoretical concepts to their own lives.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in psychological research. It gives you an in-depth understanding of each part of the research component, and allows students a better understanding of what goes on, and the tradeoffs needed to conduct good research. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who plans to participate in psych research or even just reads a lot of psych papers, as it gives you a much clear, in-depth understanding of all the underlying processes of research.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to do psych research in the future. It wasn't all that much of a time commitment, and it taught me some useful skills.",
    "Arielle is amazing! These are things you need to know if you're doing any sort of research or science at all! Take it and be prepared to work at it.",
    "If you have to take a research methods course for psychology, I would recommend PSYC 250. At least for me, clinical psychology is an interesting topic, and it was useful to learn about all the work that goes into designing research studies that can contribute more to the field and eventually help people. Research methods can be kind of boring, but Arielle makes it as engaging as she can and you'll probably learn enough to move you forward with your own research plans in the future, even if they have nothing to do with clinical psych.",
    "This is about as good a research methods course as you can take. The material is understandably pretty dry, but Professor Baskin-Sommers does a really fantastic job of making it as bearable as possible. There really isn't that much work, just a couple very short reaction papers, two exams and a meatier final paper, but no readings and no daily homework is a godsend. Unless you are really interested in doing clinical psych research than I wouldn't take it for fun, but for a psych major, this is definitely the research methods class to take.",
    "yes-- take it with arielle, and hopefully she has the same two TFs (Grace and Alli)",
    "This course is more useful than interesting. The material can be remarkably dry, as one might expect. However, as someone interested in clinical psychology, I am glad that I took this class. The workload is manageable, and the material you learn is definitely applicable. The final project was difficult but highly satisfying. I would only recommend this course to another student who is specifically interested in clinical psychology, and would definitely recommend it to a student interested in getting involved in clinical psychology research.",
    "Yes! It's a great overview of concepts that are really critical if you're interested in pursuing a degree in psychology.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is well-taught, well-organized, has a reasonable workload, and imparts crucial skills for understanding how to evaluate and conduct proper research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to learn the basics of constructing a psychology study. I would actually recommend it to anyone, since it is pretty eye-opening for any consumer of pop-science, and you get to see just how much bad research is out there. And if you're going to take it, definitely take it with Professor Baskin-Sommers. The material can be dry at times, and she's amazing at making it fun and interesting, plus she is great at explaining concepts when they get confusing. Overall, I think the class is enjoyable and useful, and if you are at all interested in the material, you should definitely shop it.",
    "I'd recommend this course. It gives a good overview of research methods with a good amount of detail. It's overall a fun class. The workload isn't too hard as long as you pace the assignments over the course of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Prof. Baskin-Sommers is a great instructor and does a very good job at making the material entertaining and easy to follow."
