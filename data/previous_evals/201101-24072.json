    "Definitely worth taking if you are at all interested in the controversy surrounding the decision of whether or not to \"state build;\" the course might seem like a class in ancient history, but the theories and analysis you read are extremely applicable to modern dilemmas, and you quickly appreciate how one's view of how states came to be informs one's opinion on the issue of state building.",
    "This course was an interesting counterpoint to many of the polisci courses at Yale which focus heavily on institutions. Class was more of a Q&A with Professor Sharma, which was fascinating at times and frustrating at others."
