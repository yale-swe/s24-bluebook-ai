   "comments": [
    "While the instructor was responsive, responses were not always clear or may not have always addressed the problem. The instructor was mainly available over an internet platform, Piazza, which was not conducive to getting help while working on a project.",
    "I thought this class was incredibly helpful. Expect the projects to take up a lot of time, but because I love visual learning, maps and formatting, I loved working on the projects. It is a bit difficult to learn GIS in the lecture setting, so when possible, follow along what dana is doing with GIS on your laptop. I am best when I learn by doing, so this helped me out. It was harder and harder to follow along though later in the semester, so I just took in depth notes on the processes on my computer.",
    "-I think Dana's actually very good at explaining the concepts and techniques in person and I was motivated (if stressed) by his paternal expectations for us. His absence from campus was sometimes frustrating, especially because the activation energy to document errors and post them to Piazza, then doing the back-and-forth to try to troubleshoot them, is higher than showing the errors to someone in person. -I was EXTREMELY frustrated by the software we used in the courseparticularly using ArcGIS via Virtual Box. Its totally absurd that ESRI has a monopoly on this software and is able to get away with 80s-era software bugs, with not making it available to Mac users, etc. Its also strange that the best solution that Yale ITS has come up with is so prone to problems. Software malfunctions and obstacles stressed me out to no end and greatly impeded my learning in the course until sometime in November, when I developed systems to navigate and mitigate the problems, and when I was able to catch up with techniques the rest of the class had mastered. -I LOVED the model-building section of the class; this was by far the most satisfying. (More on this in a moment.) -I was also frustrated by the lack of technical assistance available from CSSSI staff. Ken was absolutely invaluable and I wish Id started going to see him earlier in the semester. (I also wish Id organized my weekly schedule to leave Mondays and Tuesdays more available, as this was when other students worked in Sage near each other and would, apparently, troubleshoot and share ideas that I missed out on.) But Ken is just one TA and cant spend all his time on the class. Miriam was not really available for week-to-week homework problems (e.g., all the various technical glitches that come along with ArcGIS), and I only once found another person in CSSSI who could help me troubleshoot my problem (although even her solution, as it turned out, didnt helpas I found out after Id handed in the assignment). -Having us hand in pieces of the final project before the whole thing was due was a great ideaalthough I did poorly at first, these graded assignments forced me to start working on my data early on, meaning that eventually I had a grip on the project and could produce way better results. Recommendations: a)CSSSI should provide dedicated GIS assistants (more experienced students?)perhaps drawing on the other grad schools that use GIS?to offer drop-in help with longer time windows. b)Yale ITS should invest more time\/resources in figuring out a bug-free or less bug-prone system to using ArcGIS on Macs, given how many students use Macs and need to use GIS. c)Past a certain week, all of the homework submissions should be using the data for the final projectsso that students can devote more time on a week-by-week basis to their projects, rather than rushing to finish each graded assignment. d)The course material should be somewhat restructured, to have students learn data collection and cleaning, the basic format of working in ArcMap, then Data Interpretation, Data Automation, and lastly Data Presentation. This would follow more organically the actual course of the project. Basically, I felt that a lot of the presentation techniques were not applicable until the very end of the course, and the focus on presenting so early on was a distraction from the task of collection, cleaning, and handling the data. The model-building is also such a valuable part of the course that I think we could have spent another week on models (perhaps having, first, a simple model due, but then being asked to create a far more complex model). e)Recommend earlier that students work on projects in pairs, and use Powerpoint for designing most submissions.",
    "The class was great, I have learned so many great skills. Dana Tomlin explains concepts and tools extremely well. He is very accessible, and willing to help with any problem that comes up. My only complaint is some disorganization around the grading process. The grading feels very arbitrary, and it is difficult to understand why I got the grades I did, and what I could have done to make them better.",
    "The teacher is extremely responsive and he does a lot to help you with the material. At the same time he is also very cryptic when he explains assignments and the grading system. If he doesn't want us to know exactly what he's looking for because he wants us to figure things out on our own or make our own decisions, I think it would be better to be upfront about it.",
    "Dana's teaching style was interesting. Instead of a straightforward back-and-forth, he would rely on competition to push each other.",
    "GIS is important to many of us. The teaching style was definitely interesting (frustrating at times), but we all challenged and learned a lot.",
    "Definitely struggled with this class. I would recommend it as I think it is incredibly useful for resume building and understanding this material for the future. However, unless you are planning on becoming a GIS specialist or use GIS in your work it might be better to simply take a workshop rather than a full semester.",
    "The course was a very heavy workload and the grading I felt was arbitrary. I did not like ranking system for grades. but I do feel fairly competent at GiS now that I pretty much lived in the GIS lab all semester. I appreciate how the homework was not graded. I wouldn't have survived the workload if i was.",
    "Question 13: While the instructor was great, I had a hard time gauging how I was doing in the course. Receiving grades (for graded assignments) throughout the semester in a timely manner would have been extremely helpful.",
    "GIS is really an amazing tool. It's a steep learning curve but I think worthwhile. Dana is a highly accessible teacher. He gives his all to the course. His teaching style is very particular and will appeal more or less to different people. Generally I found him to be very engaging and a highly effective teaching. Way too much emphasis on the grades we got though, and while he encouraged collaboration and cooperation, he also (backhandedly?) encouraged competition in the class. Would like to see less emphasis on grades moving forward, especially since we barely received comments on the work we submitted.",
    "This was a very valuable course, and Dana is obviously an incredibly knowledgeable instructor. There was, however, zero clarity about the ways we were being evaluated in the course, and the project grading assumptions and parameters seemed to change every week. I think it was helpful, compared to previous years, to have multiple submissions for the project, but I think the evaluation and some logistics along the way still need work.",
    "This course is extremely time consuming and the instructor is NOT available in person.",
    "3. The course load for this class is extremely heavy, but appropriate given how much content we are working through."

    "This course absolutely needs to be taught in a computer lab. It is absolutely ridiculous that we are learning how to use software in a lecture when we have perfectly good computer labs on campus.",
    "I think a few classes should be in the GIS lab so the students can follow along with Dana as he teaches.",
    "The grading system could really stand to be re-structured. There is, if anything, a disincentive for students to put any substantial effort into weekly assignments; those that put work into weekly assignments may be at a grading disadvantage if it results in their committing less effort into the semester-long project. The lack of feedback on the semester project made this problem a larger issue; I hope the instructor will consider weighing both weekly assignments and the semester project as part of his grading for future students, because there are multiple students (myself included, to be honest) who often did well on weekly assignments but scored poorly on the graded project submissions. While I'm still happy that I took the course and feel I got a lot out of it, I already anticipate that my grade in this class will not accurately represent the amount of time and effort that I committed to the course.",
    "More references to online materials, some guest lectures with people who apply gis to various sectors like conservation, business, policy.etc will help students network and learn more about people already applying gis Also, including some learning of open-source softwares like QGIS would be ideal.",
    "Clarity of grading",
    "More TA office hours or more TA's with different office hours. Alternatively maybe there could be an optional lab component where students can get started on the homework for an hour after class with a TA or the professor present.",
    "Transparency in the grading process and goals of assignments and the class.",
    "Some of the handouts were not complete, and the handouts were very important to the learning process.",
    "The lecture structure of the class was difficult. I often found myself following along well in class, but since I hadn't been able to use the tools on my own computer, the knowledge was lost rather quickly. Because of the way I think and learn, I would have preferred more \"problem-solving\" assignments. Dana intentionally left assignment guidelines vague and open-ended to see how each student would interpret it, but this created confusion for me and some other students. I prompt with which to respond to was much easier for me to grasp and learn from.",
    "The grading",
    "I found that Professor Tomlin's lectures were tangentially related to the homework we had to do. It places the onus on the student to spend 15-20 hours each week doing the homework without much guidance, in order to meet the requirements of the course. A number of us spent many frustrated hours in front of a computer...hoping and wishing that we had received more guidance in class. StatLab consultants are absolutely necessary. There is a huge opportunity cost to this course; as a student I felt that I am spending unequal amount of time on this course, missing out on other academic opportunities at Yale. Maybe people who have taken GIS before spent less time on the homework, but for those of us new to GIS (many students were), it required a lot of time. And the homework is not even graded, so I'm not sure if the time spent is worth it. Yet, we feel compelled to give our best and that is taken advantage of. The TA also needs more hours with students. There is a line of people asking for and seeking help from the TA. I would also ask Professor Tomlin to please connect the tutorials in the agendas more directly with the homework, so we have some guidance on how to approach the HW.",
    "Timely grading and feedback.",
    "I wish there was more training about how to ask visual questions and be a creative visual thinker. Would have enjoyed assignments that were integrated into the hands-on GIS work that let us read case studies or look at professional mapping blogs for inspiration.",
    "The grading for the course (3 credits) is not commensurate with the workload of the course.It should be higher.",
    "Clarity of grading, continuity of workflow, a stronger syllabus with specific grade and evaluation measures",
    "A clearer understanding of the grading structure, metrics for evaluation, and timeline would have been helpful. It seemed like some major parts of our assignments changed and the material we were being graded on wasn't always clear.",
    "Make submissions due earlier in semester, not all crowded at the end.",
    "Homework assignments should be completely scrapped as soon as student s begin working on their projects.",

    "It was great to work on the homework with other students. It was great to bounce ideas off of each other.",
    "It was very helpful to work with a partner on the final project, because we each took in and practiced different skills better than the other. It was sometimes a waste of time, when we spent lots of time on decided how to present the data, which was just based on personal preference. Overall, working with peers throughout the course was extremely helpful.",
    "I think everyone should do the final project in a group. It was great to have the support of a partner",
    "NA",
    "Working in a group complimented each others' skills.This was quite useful in the project work as it provide an opportunity to explore ways in which the skills gained in class could be applied in the real world.There are bits in which one person had a better grasp than the other and so we could share the knowledge. It was also helpful to have someone to be accountable and kept me responsible",
    "Advantage: division of labor Disadvantage: free-riding"

   "comments": [
    "Make sure your other classes have little work, because this class will take over your life. It's also a lot easier to have ArcGIS on your computer, but it often crashes your computer, so I don't know what to tell you.",
    "Keep up with the work. Ask lots of questions. Work in Sage lab where there is a community for technical (and emotional) support. Try to view the ambiguity of assignments as an opportunity for creativity and independence.",
    "Definitely expect to put a lot of work into this class. Personally GIS stopped working on my computer so I spent a lot of time in CSSSI. Pick a project you'll like, because you'll be working on it a lot throughout the semester. GREAT class overall.",
    "I guess to game the grading system better than I did -- only do enough on the weekly assignments to learn to use the tools, and instead commit your time to the semester project (assuming the grading system remains consistent).",
    "It will change how you see data and the the advantages of spatially analysing data. You will never look at information the same way again! Highly recommend this course.",
    "Work on projects in pairs Use Powerpoint for designing most submissions Clear your Monday & Tuesday schedules to allow time for working on submissions near other students for faster troubleshooting & exchange of ideas Use Virtual Box with an awareness of its limitations",
    "Don't get hung up in the grading system, and don't worry about your grade. Do your best without driving yourself crazy. The software is not user friendly at all so even simple things are hard to figure out.",
    "Be aware of how much work this course requires.",
    "Dana's style is definitely interesting, but you will learn more from this class than you would be able to on your own.",
    "Yes, TAKE IT!!!",
    "Definitely try at least one GIS course to determine if you have a knack for it. Even though I did not, it is still a hard skill I can carry with me for life and therefore is more than worth it.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Get ready to spend LOTS of time on the homework. I would recommend that make sure all or most of your homework assignments are related to your final project. This will make your life easier when it comes to project submissions. STAT LAB consultants are hugely helpful",
    "Having a group of fellow students to discuss assignments with (when applicable) is helpful. Start your assignments early and pace yourself, especially in the beginning and very end of the term.",
    "It's a TON of work. But I think it pays off. Balance your course load carefully with this one.",
    "The course is quite heavy and requires so much time,especially those new to it.It is worth considering how demanding the other courses are and what will be the resultant effect if one chose GIS as well",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the assignments and the project. The work itself isn't too cognitively demanding, but you do have to put in a lot of hours to make things work and look nice. Mastering the software involves a lot of trial and error. The explanatory documents provided by the instructor are helpful.",
    "Take it if you are willing to sacrifice your weekends.",
    "Please be ready to spend 10-15 hours a week.",
    "Plan to spend lots of time each week working on assignments. Remember to have fun!"
