    "Incredible class. Learned so much about globalization, both the benefits and the challenges.",
    "In this course we discussed global issues that had not previously been on my radar. I think that I know have a solid framework for thinking about global inequality and trade in a new light.",
    "A holistic understanding of the main issues of globalization.",
    "This class was very helpful in understanding one of the topics that is of relevant importance today.",
    "I walk away from this course having learned an incredible amount about trade policy, globalization, immigration, and more.",
    "Great seminar of globalization from an economic perspective. Discussion of the gains and loses from it as well as the direction that it's taking nowadays.",
    "This class was fantastic for learning about the nuances of globalization.",
    "Amazing",
    "Precious few. I found that I learned extremely little in this course. Every seminar session was the same despite having a different alleged topic. If you are interested in generally knowing how to act as a trade representative then take this class, but if you are looking for more than a simple surface level understanding of globalization do the readings on your own."

   "comments": [
    "I think that Professor Zedillo is responsible for making this an interesting and though provoking course. I loved hearing his opinions and personal experience. A weakness was the set up of the class. I think that something as simple as moving to a room with a round table or reducing the class size by 5 students could have helped to generate more discussion and debate.",
    "Fantastic course. Professor Zedillo is incredible, and it is a privilege to be in this class.",
    "The level of participation in the class made it more interesting and very dynamic. If something could be improved maybe is more participation from the professor and less student presentaitons",
    "Strengths: GREAT course material - reading list was fantastic Weaknesses: Class participation was limited due to the amount of time devoted to class presentations that basically just rehashed the reading from the week",
    "Presentations took way too much class time.",
    "The format of the class it's not ideal for group discussion. I think that a round table instead of a traditional classrooms could have been better to promote greater participation among students.",
    "Strengths - read a lot of fantastic texts Weaknesses - not a dialogue driven seminar; presentations can be boring at sometime, and your criticism is limited to what the student giving the presentation thought of.",
    "Amazing class",
    "Despite being branded as a \"seminar,\" this class consists of a 1:00 long lecture by Professor Zedillo and a 0:50 student presentation summarizing the readings. While Professor Zedillo would verbalize his wishes to make the class more discussion focused, I was unimpressed by his efforts. There was next to no class engagement. Furthermore, grading is incredibly arbitrary, which is understandable in light of the fact that there is extremely little content taught in this course. Very little feedback is given, and expectations are unclear."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class. President Zedillo is a fantastic instructor and expert on the topic.",
    "You should take this class if you're truly interested in the subject material I'm particularly passionate about globalization and trade issues, so I thought the content was great. You do a wide range of reading on different aspects of globalization (check the syllabus) and do weekly reading responses (2 pages) on anything that piques your interest. The class itself was a bit frustrating because of the format. Students rotate giving presentations on the assigned reading each week but if you're supposed to do these reading for class, why are we rehashing in class? Also, the reading responses were supposed to be graded but our TA never gave out a single grade after the first one. Zedillo is extremely knowledgeable though, and taking a class with the former president of Mexico is a pretty cool thing.",
    "Incredible course and a must-take for Econ majors!",
    "Yes, it is very interesting to hear from Professor Zedillo's personal experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. When else are you going to get the chance to learn from someone like Professor Zedillo, who is so knowledgable and has first hand experience with the topics discussed in class. The reading list was fantastic, the material very very interesting. My one critique of this course is that too much emphasis\/time was given to student presentations, and there was little to no time to debate\/discuss the material in class with Professor Zedillo.",
    "A wonderful, book-a-week senior Econ seminar that combines policy and theory to talk about some of the most pressing, contemporary issues in the field. Worth it just to hear Professor Zedillo give color to some of the things we talk about (\"When I talked to President Clinton about NAFTA...\"), which is an incredible honor. Discussion in seminar is student-led (weekly presentations), with a weekly reading response.",
    "YES. Learned loads.",
    "Not so hard senior seminar. Although the workload of readings per week is high, it's doable. There's only one presentation you have to prepare, a midterm, and a final paper.",
    "If you want to learn about globalization and understand the nuances behind it, specifically how it's been demonized by many factions in 2016, this class is fantastic. Not only is Professor Zedillo insightful and ready to answer every question, but the texts that he selects are fantastic and varied.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course.",
    "ABSOLUTELY NOT! (Unless you desperately need an Econ seminar)"
