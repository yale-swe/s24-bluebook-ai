    "This is a really interesting class that is totally different from anything I have taken so far. We each had a rat that we fed, weighed, and used in testing for the entire semester. It's a pretty big time commitment because you have a lot of different testing and feeding that you have to do outside of the class hours. Don't take this if you hate rats.",
    "Too much work, too much time for a basic requirement. There's a final and a final paper, not to mention how long you spend running your rats on these studies (including a virtual one at the beginning).",
    "take this if you need to. it's actually alot more work than advertised. The lab requirement is a real pain especially later in the semester so plan well ahead. The material is a bit dense especially during the first half, and professor's choice of specialized old-school vocabs doesn't really help ease the material. Once you get used to it though, it's great. Professor Wagner is a legend in this field, as you will see when you take this course. The entire field (literally) has his name written all over it. I would take it again just to tell my children that I took a course taught by the man who created the Rescorla-Wagner Theory",
    "You'll take it because you're required to take it. The rat portion was really fun and really, really not that much work. Yes, you had to feed your rat every day. That takes about a half hour of commitment, and you're probably going to be in the area of Dunham Lab (aka. kitty corner from Commons) every day anyway.Take good notes during lecture and HOLD ONTO THE LECTURE OUTLINES. Read the book but not too carefully. If you pay attention to the kind of language that Professor Wagner likes because he's an incredible stickler. Take coffee with you to class.",
    "Take this course, not only if you need a lab requirement, but in general if you are interested in the field. If you need the research methods requirement for Psych this is the way to go!! You get to play with your rats everyday (yes, sometimes it is a chore but it can be really therapeutic) and they have moved the location down science hill closer to civilization so IGNORE the past posts that say you have to trek up a far distance!",
    "Good way to fulfill the research methods requirement. The rat component is time consuming but not too much work outside of that. Wagner is the know all on this topic and basically is attributed for all modern thinking on learning theory, which is cool.",
    "This is a good class. Most people who take it are only taking it because they have to and not because they want to, but if you pay attention to Professor Wagner, you'll actually learn quite a lot. Sometimes his lecture style can seem a little scattered, but if you try to understand the themes he's emphasizing, you'll probably get a lot out of it. He's also brilliant and an absolute giant in the field, so the opportunity to take a small class with him is pretty cool. HOWEVER -- the time commitment is pretty major. I personally didn't really mind feeding and weighing the rats every day (though some people did), but the experiment for the last two weeks of class before the break was an absolute nightmare. Be prepared to spend time coding videos and to come in for at least an hour every other day.",
    "Professor Wagner is boring, but he's one of the leaders in the field so it's a great opportunity to learn from him. Working with the rats is fun, but it does take time. You have to go to Dunham everyday to feed, weigh, and experiment on the rats.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was a wonderful learning experience, one of the best courses I have taken at school."
