    "Recommended class! Take it!",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get in. Professor Brotherton likes to keep his seminars small, which is frustrating during shopping period, but great once you're in the class. Professor Brotherton is an amazing teacher and really cares about his students. The books you read are great and the class discussion is very interesting. I am an HSHM major, and was a little nervous about taking an upper level anthro class since I knew nothing about anthropological theory, but Professor Brotherton makes everything very accessible. The workload is do-able if you plan your time accordingly - aproximately 1\/2 or 1 book a week + a reading response. You are in charge of leading two weeks of discussion, and then have one 15 page final paper.",
    "This was a great course. It's simple: half a book a week about a topic that is very current and relevant to medical anthropology. i loved it! emphasis on reading (weekly responses though) and discussion. final research paper is super broad and allows you to study what you're interested in!",
    "ANTH 427 is a great class to learn about medical issues that you've probably heard about, but haven't thought about in a more personal way. It's a fairly moderate workload class - it really depends if you're a quick or slow reader. The reading responses are painless and help you process the material as well. Seminar is awesome fun with really cool people. I would definitely recommend this class. Just a warning though! Start the paper early!!!",
    "ANTH 427 is a really amazing class. There is a lot of reading, but most of it is very enjoyable and you learn a lot. Professor Brotherton is really on top of it and also super engaging. Overall, would definitely recommend.",
    "Take it! It's a small seminar and this year most of the students were anthropology majors, but I had never taken an anthropology class before and I felt welcome and comfortable. The format is about a book per week with weekly reading responses, a couple of informal presentations, and a 15-page final paper. Professor Brotherton creates a refreshingly friendly and engaging class atmosphere, and is very helpful outside of class if you don't quite know what to expect for how to write an anthropology paper. The books were really interesting. Just be prepared for a lot of anthropology theory that might sound jargon-y. And know that anthropology students spend a lot of time critiquing current medical practices without coming up with any practical alternatives. But it's worth it!",
    "A must-take for students interested in expanding their understanding of medicine and health."
