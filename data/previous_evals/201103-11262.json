    "7. It was unfortunately clear that the professor had no interest in teaching the class.",
    "Readings\/textbooks need to be addressed. They are useful, but the coursebook written by the instructor is incomplete and would be extremely valuable if finished. Also, the chemistry book would be useful if more emphasis was put into reading it.",

    "Question 5: It was often difficult to get responses to questions asked via email.Question 7b: The TA was very available and helpful. However, I believe that better communication between the instructor and the TA would have significantly improved the TA's helpfulness, as he was often at a loss to explain the requirements of certain assignments."

The speaker was extremely informative and presented an interesting perspective on stormwater management technologies.",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps better coordination from the instructor - he can improve by being more available and accessible to students.",
    "Responsiveness of primary instructor.",
    "There is significant (over 50%) overlap in course material between this course and Physical Sciences. This course should be presented as an alternative to Physical Sciences for people with adequate background. Alternatively, this course should cover more advanced material.",
    "Complete revision of the syllabus, starting from lecture slides to textbook to contents.",
    "The class seemed a bit unorganized. The instructor needs to address concerns and questions in a more timely manner. Homework assignments need to be returned earlier so students may use the materials to study for exams. Connections between materials and concepts should be strengthened - there was a lot of confusion on vague questions asked on exam and homework assignments.",
    "None that I can think of.",
    "The overall course material was limited and rather unorganized. We had a supplementary book about the Forested Ecosystem at Hubbard Brook, but it was poorly incorporated into the class discussions. It would have been helpful if we could have gone deeper into the course content -several of the lectures were too generalized and lacked graduate-level material. The professor is very knowledgable about aquatic chemistry, but he did not do a good job sharing this knowledge with the class. He was always willing to answer questions, but I did not always know the right questions to ask to glean more information.",
    "I felt that there was less of a focus on Pollution than I would have liked. In addition, I would have liked to have make-up classes that covered the topics that were originally supposed to be taught during the missed classes."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor was never available.TA had great availability!",
    "Gabe was exceptionally difficult to get in touch with and did not offer any regular office hours. It would also be better if the future TA held regular office hours instead of just right before exams.",
    "The TA was very responsive and available. He responded to questions or concerns in a timely manner and also made himself available to review materials prior to exams or homework assignments.The instructor needs to make himself more available, especially with regards to questions or concerns on lecture material. The instructor made himself available after class when asked, which is great, but if a question or meeting request was sent to his email, he rarely responded. Plus, it is inconvenient that the instructor does not use his Yale email account, but rather a Gmail account. Can he not have this forwarded to gmail like the rest of us?",
    "Excellent.",
    "The TA was very helpful and made himself readily available to answer questions and discuss problem sets.The instructor made himself available to address questions after class.",
    "The TA was very available, and often helpful, though, as mentioned above, he would have been more helpful had there been more communication between the instructor and the TA. The instructor was often somewhat difficult to get hold of.",
    "Fairly good, although sometimes took a while to respond to email."

    "Yes!",

    "Yes.",
    "I gained some new knowledge about data analysis, which was helpful. However, I was hoping to go deeper into nutrient cycling and the specifics about each compound. We seemed to breeze over this material and didn't go into much detail.",

    "Don't take it.Stud on your own.",
    "The course provides valuable information, but it will require outside time to completely understand concepts. I would recommend those taking this course to stay on top of the course work, reviewing weekly to remember the vast amount of information. Also, ask questions and keep asking them if they are still not answered or clearly explained. The materials are cumulative, and it is valuable to review often and put as much emphasis on the materials from the beginning of the course as those from the end of the course.",
    "Go over basic redox chemistry before starting the course, if possible.",
    "This class is helpful for learning about basic data analysis, but I do not recommend it if you already have an in-depth background in chemistry and nutrient cycling.",
    "This course gives a good, basic overview of biogeochemistry, with a strong focus on water quality. If this is what you are interested in it is a good course. However, for others it may not provide enough technical theory or engineering utility."
