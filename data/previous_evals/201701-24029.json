    "I think this course contains a lot of very important topics that all physicians and scientists should be thinking about. I thought the speakers were all great. My only suggestion for improvement is that a lot of people in the class are going to be doing clinical research and need IRB approvals, etc.- but at these sessions it seems as though we only discuss cases relevant to people doing more bench research. I think it would be helpful to make the concepts more broadly applicable to the types of research the class is going to be engaged in."

These are all things every scientist should know."
