    "If you're considering it, you probably need it anyway. It's a fine class.",
    "Hard but necessary",
    "A valuable introduction to statistics and regression analysis with applications focused on economic and social science. It was interesting and valuable for me despite my lack of a background in economics. It is challenging but very worthwhile.",
    "Practical introduction to econometrics; runs through AP Stat curriculum and teaches you about regression. Fairly dry, but Doug is a great instructor who cares a lot about his students. Lectures are recorded and attendance isn't required, and instructors are fairly responsive on Piazza. (And it's required for the Econ major, so if you're taking it you likely don't have a choice.)",
    "If you like stats, this is a fun class. Obviously it's a requirement for ECON as well.",
    "Applied economics. Very useful in understanding the role of economists and economic research. A lot of work, felt like I was taking 2 classes during some periods of the course.",
    "While Professor McKee is an excellent lecturer and professor, I would recommend some sort of basic statistics background before taking the class. It is especially helpful when you get into the harder stuff in the second half of the class to have some basic understanding of linear regression and statistics.",
    "A required course for the Econ major; not as painful as they say it is. McKee is also a really cool guy and teaches pretty well. It's not that hard to do well in the class as long as you keep up with the work. The problem sets aren't too long and the quizzes can be taken twice. The exams are pretty hard, but they can be considered \"fair.\" Also, lecture attendance isn't necessary. The group project is a major pain, though.",
    "TAKE THIS WITH DOUG! I loved it with him. I hear bad things about other professors. He records all his lectures which helps if you have trouble staying focused in class. I appreciated being able to watch the lectures on my own time and make sure I understood everything before moving on. He's also super nice and accessible, also the TFs for this class were great this semester.",
    "The course was not as difficult as I was anticipating. I did not like the group project and I wish he would remove it as a course requirement. I also did not find section to be that helpful.",
    "Would not recommend it unless they start being more helpful in teaching how to solve problems.",
    "This course is a lot. It is a lot of material. It is a lot of assignments. It is a lot of stuff really really fast and not nearly enough time to process it or become competent. ESPECIALLY if you have never taken stats before. But, it is also mostly worthwhile and I really learned a lot that I am excited to continue using. So it's kind of a \"lose\" on short-term sanity and grades at the same time as being a \"win\" on long-term growth and understanding. If you are an Econ major you have to take this, so be warned that the material is rough. But since you have to take it, make sure to take it with McKee. He cares a lot about you as students, about the material itself, and about being a good teacher, which I think is one of the best part about this class.",
    "A tough class, definitely helpful if you have taken another Stats course, AP Stat was enough for me. Professor McKee is a phenomenal instructor, probably the best Economics professor I have had so far at Yale. If you have to take this class for the Econ major, I would recommend waiting until the semester that Professor McKee is teaching.",
    "Econometrics was a tough class, but I learned quite a bit. Professor McKee is very committed to making sure that his class is an effective learning environment, and I enjoyed his teaching style. Lectures were pretty fasted paced, so it was hard to follow them throughout the class period. Thankfully they were recorded and posted online, which allowed us to pause the video and take notes. The problem sets were difficult and time consuming, but they really helped us to learn the material. The group project was the smoothest group project that I've ever had at Yale. My group was full of hard workers, and we consistently met for an hour almost every week from the very beginning for about an hour each some (sometimes a little more\/less depending on how soon the next portion of the project was due). Our hard work paid off, though, because we scored very well (Thanks, Michael). There are few cons to this course other than the fact that it is difficult and time consuming. Doug is a great professor, and Michael Puempel was a great TA. I can't say I enjoyed the class, but it definitely helped me to boost my quantitive skills and added a few tools to my toolbox.",
    "Fantastic class. Econometrics gives you a great toolset for analyzing real-world problems; it's one of those classes that every student should take, just to learn how to think about life. Doug is a great professor, and makes an effort to connect with all of his students and really respond to feedback. All of the lectures are posted online, so a lot of students choose not to go to class, but just be careful not to fall behind on lectures whether you go in person or watch online, because your test performances will really depend on having learned the material. If you've already taken a stats class before, you've probably seen a lot of the material in the first half of the semester already, but the second half of the semester covers multiple regression, which is new to most students in this class. Finally, be warned that a large part of your grade will depend on a group research project, which can be either really rewarding or really stressful, depending on the group of people you're working with and how well you budget your time.",
    "You will get all the possible tools for learning Econometrics. Since the course provides a lot of real world examples, you will not only get academic knowledge but also practice with a real dataset. You also practice what you learned through a team project, so that the learnings you get out of this course are highly likely to stay for a long time.",
    "I would recommend 131 simply because the material itself and learning STATA are extremely important, especially if you will work with data at any point in the future. The concepts we covered were interesting and I love how they was centered on real world data and applications. The first half was basically AP Stat, but I felt like the second half of the course covered too much information too quickly. This could be improved with many many more practice problems and less labs in section. In light of this, having video lectures were a blessing. If I had been sick and missed a lecture, it would have been very difficult to understand the material without the videos. This class sounds like a lot of work - one pset every 2 weeks, weekly quizzes, midterm, video lectures(if you don't go to class), group project, and final, but it's really not that bad if you keep up with the video lectures throughout the semester(which can be difficult). Prof McKee really cares about teaching and really responsive on Piazza, and you come away with a bettering understanding of the uses for statistics. I also really recommend working with other people in the class!",
    "If you can get through the first half, the second half of the course will be fine. It doesn't get harder than intermediate microeconomics, but can have its own challenges. The midterm will likely be harder than the final, so make sure you understand the first half very well, there won't be much opportunity to distinguish yourself apart from the midterm and the final.",
    "Yes if needed for the major\/ other requirements. I'm not an econ major, but I'm glad this class exposed me to so many relevant components of data analysis.",
    "ECON131 is a very interesting course and I would recommend taking it if you have any interest in economics and related fields. Obviously it's a requirement for the economics major, but it is still a very useful course to have a grasp of the material in.",
    "ECON 131 is an introductory econometrics course. The first half covers material one could learn in any into statistics course or AP stat in high school, while the second half covers regression models and applications unique to economics. The lecture style is engaging and very interactive, with the professor asking students to solve problems in groups in nearly every lecture. There is also a group project that, for many students, was a very positive experience and reinforced the material. I would recommend this class to students that want an introduction to statistics, but with the warning that you will have to do extra work outside of lecture to understand all of the material.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it if you need to for major requirements. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest taking it.",
    "A pretty decent course overall. With McKee, you will definitely learn basic econometrics and have a pretty good experience doing so.",
    "Take this course if needed for the econ major. But if you are interested in really learning statistics, then you should look at other courses. This course is very much a brief overview and students may be better served by taking a course that goes more in depth over more semesters.",
    "Econ 131 was a lot more interesting than I imagined, but still it was a very hard class. I would not recommend taking this unless you have to, or unless you're really interested in a higher level of probability and statistics.",
    "Take it if you are an Econ major, or you want to learn more about stat (regression). I had some knowledge of stat before, so the first half of the lecture was not very new to me. Basically I learnt some fundamental principles about regression, and usage of Stata. There is a plethora of quizzes, some PSets, exams and a research project. If you are willing to learn, workload is manageable, and you can reach out to the Prof, he would be willing to help.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you are an Econ major.",
    "Good, and perhaps more importantly, useful course, especially for economics majors or anyone interested in data analysis. First half of the course covers basic statistical tests (z, t, chi-squared), while second half focuses on designing regression analyses. Both were fairly easy for me, though this may have to do with the fact that I've taken a couple basic stats classes before. Still, most that have any background in statistics, even if its just AP stat will probably find class fairly easy (the first half is basically a review of AP stat.)",
    "I did not have any prior stats experience. This course, though a little fast at first, is your best shot at a smooth learning curve. Doug is the best econ lecturer I have had. He really wants his students to succeed. I highly recommend taking this course with him.",
    "You learn a lot if you put the effort in. Would recommend over just plain stats if you want to learn more application.",
    "Econ 131 Is a must take class for anyone who wants to be able to understand empirical experiments and the results they produce. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested even slightly in statistics. If you put in the time, you will gain so much from this class.",
    "Standard statistics and a lot of probability and then regression",
    "Take this class over Econ 135 unless you're an Econ-Math major. The instructor is great, and the class focuses a lot more on applications of concepts in Stata and through real life research papers, rather than abstract matrix theory that you are unlikely to ever use in your life.",
    "Okay",
    "ECON 131 began with probability and statistics, and moved on to regression after the midterm. ECON 131 is an interesting and challenging course, and I would recommend it for students who want to become versed in the methods currently used in economics research. I would caution students that many who take the class have already taken AP Statistics, and the first half of the class is review for them and moves very fast for others. It might be a good idea to take a stats course first. I would recommend taking the course with Professor McKee!",
    "Do the work and get to know the professor. It is an interesting class if you embrace it!",
    "I really enjoyed Econometrics. Professor McKee is awesome, and I found the material to be highly applicable and useful. I strongly recommend this class!",
    "I would take it even if I wasn't an econ major. The class will teacher you how to analyze statistics in a meaningful way and can teach you how to read econometrics papers. Really useful and fun. It turns out many things you might think are intuitive are not true: it's like a class of freakonomics.",
    "Great class to help you think of stats.",
    "An awesome class. Doug Mckee is a fantastic teacher. The class itself teaches you statistics and regression, which gives a good foundation for econometrics.",
    "This course is great and gets better once the actual data analysis starts! The problem sets are not too tough and the tests are well thought out to be challenging but not downright disappointing. The group project worked out quite well in my case although I felt I put in more effort than was required and the TA marked very leniently! It's really cool that in section you learn Stata that is not formally taught in class so I really suggest attending. The TA's were also extremely helpful!",
    "Only take it if you have to I guess. Doug goes really quickly and covers quite a lot of material, so if you don't have some prior knowledge of statistics it can be hard to keep up. STAT10x and GLBL121 cover most (but not all) of the same things and are better-taught so that might be a better option. Doug is cool and really helpful and tries to incorporate all sorts of pedagogy into his classes, but his lecturing is rather disorganized. Also he posts lecture videos online so eventually most people don't bother showing up. Workload is meh problem sets are long and tedious and they only grade one problem on each, and a group project that honestly was a total pain. However overall you learn a fair bit from the class, and you pick up lots of STATA as well, which is useful.",
    "Challenging but rewarding",
    "Take it because you have to for econ. If you have any background in stats you'll probably be pretty bored for the first half of the course. If you're not an econ major and just looking for a data analysis class, take stat 230 instead.",
    "Bi-weekly p-sets (often including labs from section, so go to section!), one midterm and a final. Great class and very informative, however, easy to fall behind given the luxury of the online lectures. My advice, either watch the lectures the day of or go to class, don't let yourself fall behind because the material gets more interesting throughout and the final will be tough if you don't keep up with the work.",
    "Take it if you are an econ major, but I would not recommend otherwise.",
    "An awesome class that will teach you extremely valuable concepts that are applicable in numerous professional fields. I would definitely recommend going to every lecture and using the online lectures as supplementary resources rather than only watching the online lectures. Professor McKee is the best part of this class, so make sure you get as much face time with him as possible."
