    "I loved it! I learned a great deal in this course and I now have a deeper understanding of what I am doing when I run an analysis on SPSS.",
    "It's a multivariate statistics class meaning that we learn to analyze data with multiple variable and more complex designs. I would recommend it to students they just need to be willing to put in a lot of extra work if their statistics background isn't strong.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation to anyone who will need to use statistics in the social sciences. Quite possibly the best statistics class you will ever take.",
    "take it! it was great!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It really deepens students' understanding about not only the statistics itself but also how to practically apply statistical methods to one's own research. This was a very valuable experience for me.",
    "This course is a must to all students in the social sciences.",
    "A great class on statistics beyond the undergraduate level. I highly recommend it! Even if you are not mathematically inclined, you will be able to follow the lectures and understand everything in the class. Prof. Dovidio does a great job of making the material truly accessible.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 518 to another psychology student; I couldn't imagine another class that would better prepare us with the tools needed to begin research.",
    "A very, very useful and understandable introductory course of statistics. Very recommandable.",
    "This is a required course for students in the psychology department but definitely not a tedious waste of time. I benefited from the course even though I took similar classes as an undergraduate. Students from other departments looking for an applied, behavioral-science oriented statistics class may find this course valuable as well."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped to build valuable skills that will be integral when I'm analyzing data and writing up my results. It was very important for me to see this part of research which isn't as enchanting as designing or running studies but is really important.",
    "it will make my research 100 times easier",
    "It is relevant to each and every experiment I conduct and write up.",
    "This course was extremely useful for me in terms of furthering my resesarch because it covered exactly the statistical methods that I will need to use for analyzing my data.",
    "This was a crucial course to take in the first semester of grad school. Ibelieve it has shaped how I will approach my own research, as well as how I consume the research of others.",
    "Statistics is very important for psychology and for everyday life. The understanding of it is the key to success in our field. John did an excellent job in bringing us closer to that success!"
