    "Fun and interesting. Well organized. Harder than expected.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are strong in quantitative areas. The material is interesting enough to justify taking the class, but it is no walk in the park.",
    "PHYS 343 is a fantastic elective for physics majors. In addition to having a lighter workload and being less stressful than the other courses in the major, it really opened my mind to areas of physics that I had never thought of before. The course is basically all about gravity, which is a fascinating and mysterious subject. The course is divided into three units: in the first, you learn about how exoplanets are detecting using observations based on newtonian gravity. Then you use general relativity to explore black holes and the curvature of spacetime. The final unit, on cosmology, was my favorite. It was fascinating to learn about the expansion and content of the universe, and how you can infer the circumstances of the birth and ultimate fate of the universe. It was also very humbling to realize just how little we know about the universe (you learn how we know that 95% of the content of the universe is dark energy and dark matter, which we know next to nothing about).",
    "As an applied math major, I wasn't sure what to expect when jumping into an upper level physics class with only a high school AP Physics background. It turned out to be doable, especially the first unit on Exoplanets and the third unit on Cosmology. The second unit on General Relativity was tough, because most of the physics majors had background at least in Special Relativity (a more basic form of GR), and I was definitely playing catch up on a confusing subject that was covered at a very fast pace. The class was also more difficult, because I was a bit rusty on Newtonian mechanics and not as used to the types of calculus techniques that physics majors very commonly use, which are different than those I commonly use in other applied math classes. That being said, I think it was worth taking this class because it changed my view of the universe dramatically, and I learned a lot of fascinating things about the universe that I never would have learned otherwise. Also, Professor Padmanabhan and the TAs are extremely accessible and willing to help out when needed. For other non-physics-majors considering taking this class, it is much more time consuming and difficult to do well in than the similar class for non-majors (Frontiers & Controversies in Astrophysics). But if you have a decent math background (multivariate calculus, ordinary differential equations, etc.), it was well worth learning the math behind the topics covered, because it made them that much more interesting\/believable. Fascinating subject material, got credit towards my major, and doable with some extra work (if I did it then so can you!).",
    "solid class, not very mathematically intensive and not very much work. really cool concepts and Prof Padmanabhan is awesome and accessible.",
    "Contrary to most reviews, I found that this class does have a bit of work. It is definitely cool material, but don't expect to derive all of the fundamental equations. There is a bit of math in exploring the consequences, and it was all fairly interesting. Also, Nikhil Padmanabhan is a fantastic professor.",
    "Great analytic introduction to astrophysics.",
    "PHYS 343 was a fascinating course. We covered three areas of astrophysics exoplanets, general relativity \/ black holes, and cosmology (the universe on its largest scale). Nikhil was awesome the lectures were engaging, the problems sets were hard but interesting, and the exams were fair. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone interested in astrophysics, cosmology, or anything of the sort.",
    "Really interesting and fun class. Would advise everyone (non-physics and physics majors alike) to take. One note: find a group to work with! the psets become infinitely easier.",
    "Very good physics elective covering exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology (topics might vary by year). A great introduction to astrophysics for those who have been stuck studying the smaller things in the physics core, or to non-physics majors who'd like a good standalone physics course beyond the intro sequence but below the 400-level courses. Padmanabhan is a very good lecturer and the problem sets, while not necessarily short, are roughly biweekly.",
    "Great course taught by a great professor. It takes a look at exoplanets, general relativity, and cosmology. Although that might sound intimidating, anyone with a decent Yale physics background is more than prepared to take this course. The class is less about deriving the major equations\/results but rather understanding the often cool conclusions that can be drawn from them.",
    "One of the best physics electives you could take!! Excellently paced and planned. The textbooks are fun to read. And Padmanabhan is amazing. He's a knowledgeable lecturer and really cared about how his students are doing. And he skillfully maneuvers difficult derivations to give a broad, but not overly hand-wavy overview. 3 midterms, psets every week or two, and a chill final project.",
    "The course covers A LOT of different topics at a fast rate. Do not expect to understand General Relativity, Black Holes or Dark Energy deeply, but rather plugging into equations you are given about them. It is a good course, but just know that it gives a brief survey of all of astrophysics as opposed to having you understand them from first principles (as is done in most other physics courses).",
    "For a stem major, I highly recommend this class. For a non-stem major, you will have to credit d. This is by no means an easy class. Padmanabahn is a wonderful lecturer, but he goes really fast and generally assumes a good knowledge of physics from his students. The material is pretty fascinating, but do not take this as a gut.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to know the answer to some of the coolest questions about the existence of the universe. The professor goes really fast, so it might be tough keeping up with the pace of the class, but it is definitely worth it.",
    "Loved this class. Interesting subject material, a fair courseload, and very well structured. Professor Padmanabhan is a clear and engaging lecturer who puts a great amount of time and effort into the course, and does his utmost to make sure that students not only understand what is being taught, but really engage with and love the material. Though the material can be challenging, and the class moves fast, the workload is not bad. Weekly P sets (4-6 hours), 3 non cumulative midterms, and a presentation converted into a 5 page paper. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the topics. One of my favourite courses at Yale",
    "This course neatly falls into three sections. Exoplanets and GR were fantastic, and I highly recommend them. Cosmology was a bit wooly for my liking - assumptions were presented fast and furious without any real justification.",
    "Well taught class divided into 3 sections - Exoplanets, Black Holes, and Cosmology. Probably my favorite science class at Yale. Material is explained clearly and Padmanabhan is always very happy to talk if you have any questions. Don't think he is teaching it next year\/next few years though...",
    "Fun!! Moderately challenging (the first unit on exoplanets was, for me, the hardest), but the good kind of challenging. The class explores some of the most interesting and active areas of astrophysics: exoplanet hunting, black holes, and cosmology (i.e. the study of the universe as a whole). The material is more qualitative than quantitative; we flew through lots of somewhat unnecessary derivations just for thoroughness's sake. Professor Padmanabhan is a fun and engaged professor who was always quick to respond to emails, and who even led his own midterm review sessions. As far as work goes, you have p-sets every 1.5 weeks, three non-cumulative exams, and a final poster\/paper. My advice: FIND A STUDY GROUP! These p-sets are much harder without the combined brainpower of a study group (and then you can make friends, because it's an interesting group of students that choose to take the class). If you want to delve a little deeper into astronomy, and have a comfortable background in calculus, take this class!"
