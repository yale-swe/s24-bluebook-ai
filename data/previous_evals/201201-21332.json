   "comments": [
    "Even if you only were really interested in one half of this course, it would be worth taking, mainly because Professor MacKay is terrific. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in Russian and\/or American literature and history, and who wants a seminar that goes by in a flash.",
    "It was excellent! the readings were great, professor Mackay was great, and the comparisons were evident and not forced. The only weakness was probably (and this is unavoidable) that for a seminar you do more reading than you can deeply discuss. Professor MacKay is wonderful. He clearly has a lot going on, but it doesn't affect his excellent and enthusiastic leadership in the classroom. He's a wealth of knowledge! Absolutely take a course with him.",
    "Professor Mackay is the most lovely and inspiring professor you'll ever have. It will be a shock to those of you with only a spare interest in the topic that this is such an interesting and engaging class, but the questions it raises go far beyond Russia or Slavery or any of the seemingly historical attributes of the course. That said, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A LITERATURE COURSE THAT ACTIVELY ENGAGES WITH HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND THEORY, take it. Mackay's blending of historical narrative with theoretical investigations is something I will carry with me, hopefully, for the rest of my academic career.",
    "You're an idiot if you don't take this class.",
    "John MacKay is a larger than life character, and it is worth taking a class with him before your time at Yale is up. His excitement for the books we read (and many we didn't) and his enthusiasm for discussion made seminars engaging and discussion very lively. The reading themselves are on average good, with a several gems and a few duds (read for historical exposure rather than literary merit). Generally, this is more of a literature class than a history class (note that neither paper is a research paper), but MacKay's approach is by nature interdisciplinary."
