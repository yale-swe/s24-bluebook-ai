   "comments": [
    "A wonderful course. Professor Taft is extremely knowledgeable and a great seminar leader, and the syllabus is full of interesting stuff. If you're interested at all in housing, take it!",
    "Take it if you can! It's unique and different from urban studies classes or a history class!",
    "Definitely would recommend this class. I don't think you necessarily need to be interested specifically in housing policy; it's more the way the class allows you to go in-depth but address themes that affect broader issues that is what makes it so great. It's a niche subject, per se, but it is so relevant and goes so much beyond housing - you're able to address a lot of social justice issues through the perspective of it. Professor Taft is great and does a great job leading the class in a way that makes it avoid a lot of seminar pitfalls. It's a lot of work in terms of the sheer number of assignments but the readings are doable, which is nice. You get to do a lot of different types of assignments which is nice because then it's not just paper after paper. I think it's a really great course design all around. Take it!",
    "This is an amazing class - my favorite at Yale so far. Impactful readings, rich discussions, really clear themes, and a great long term history of housing as well as an in depth look at policies that have shaped the housing market today. A few short papers, two presentations, and a final. Love love loved this class, made me change the way I think about inequality. This is what a college course should be!",
    "I loved this course! You learn so much about housing patterns and reforms that have shaped our thinking of home today. From Colonial times to current gentrifiers. The professor is great and I recommend that everyone take this class.",
    "The history of housing and urban development, beginning with colonial settlements and running through the 2008 foreclosure crisis and urban decay in Detroit. This is a well-organized class, and the material is extremely interesting and relevant. I especially like the focus on New Haven and Yale's role in the city's urban development -- we did a tour of a nearby luxury loft development, which was the highlight of the course for me. That said, there are a lot of tedious smaller assignments (three 2-3 page reading responses, a presentation proposal, two 5-page papers, an in-class presentation, plus a long final). I also think this class would be better as a lecture or a two-hour seminar, because the twice-weekly seminar meeting for 1h 15m results in students not preparing as well and class discussion being significantly shallower. Take it if you know nothing about housing history (which really is very fascinating) and you're prepared to put some work into twice a week.",
    "Great class. Unlike many classes where I come out wondering what I actually learned that semester, I actually learned an incredible amount of useful knowledge about housing throughout US history. I looked forward to studying for this final exam, which, as a second semester senior, says a lot. Take it!",
    "A wonderful new course on a significant topic! It's a mix of history, AmStud, and sociology as it studies the development of housing in America. I highly recommend taking this course to understand the situation of cities today. It's basically a lecture-seminar hybrid. The workload is a bit demanding, but not overwhelming--besides, the readings are fascinating and varied. Prof. Taft is a great discussion leader.",
    "History of Housing in America charts the social, political and economic ideologies surrounding the housing industry in America. Bit of an overview of everything. I would recommend if you're interested in learning out the ways our current ideas about Americanness and citizenship as linked to the home.",
    "History of Housing in America is a great class. It's super helpful to learn how to analyze primary materials (physical building sites, photographs\/images, and text), and the subject is fascinating. We all have to live somewhere eventually, and this class informs the historical arc of how housing inequalities and stereotypes may have formed. The class also helped students develop an understanding of key issues to inform housing policy and personal housing decisions. Professor Taft is really great, and I definitely recommend this course."
