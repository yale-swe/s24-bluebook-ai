    "Understanding typographic elements, history of type faces, working at different scales of typography,",

    "I learned a huge amount about typography, the history of typefaces, design, bookmaking, poster design, and incredible skills relating to form and function of text design in general.",
    "I learned more about graphic design from Professor Alice Chung in this class than any other class. Her incredible eye, brilliancy, generosity with her time, and hard work taught me so much.",
    "I learned so much about the history of typography, how to discuss typographic concepts, and how to use InDesign and typesetting to create books and posters.",
    "I have gained more insights into the basic fonts around us. Heightened my design sensibilities a lot.",
    "I learned more about how to leverage text in graphic designs. I learned the importance of typesetting and how readability depends on it. I also learned how to balance between creating an innovate design without sacrificing readability."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great projects to help practice and experiment with typographic elements. Very helpful feedback and critiques from teacher and classmates. Felt like there were a few too many exercises at the beginning, especially because we didn't talk about several of them. Time management could also be improved, in terms of making sure there's enough time for critiques and enough time for revisions of the final project. Think it would also be helpful to have some flexibility on the word count for the poster project, perhaps once things have been laid out on the page.",
    "I think that this course only occurring once a week made it hard to feel as active in the class as we only saw our professor 12 times this entire semester, and although we met for almost four hours every week it was mainly spent critiquing instead of getting any in-class workshopping time, which I have found in past graphic design classes to be very helpful. Also the critiques took up a surprising amount of the class period despite there only being 12 students in the class, and some days not everyone was able to get their project fully discussed by the entire class, which made it difficult to know how to progress to the next part of the project in some instances.",
    "Strengths: Professor Chung is incredible. Her teaching is concise, detailed, and very deep. This course is challenging, but extremely rewarding. Weaknesses: this course sometimes feels rushed in spite of being a four-hour session!",
    "There were only strengths to the class, in which I learned more about graphic design from Professor Alice Chung in this class than any other class. Her incredible eye, brilliancy, generosity with her time, and hard work taught me so much. The only improvement I can imagine is having more time because we'd always run out of time during critiques.",
    "This course had so many strengths! It was such a valuable learning experience and I gained so much practical design and typesetting knowledge. The one weakness was that critiques ran over time a lot, so maybe timing each person would help with that. Also, printing is so expensive that it can easily pose a financial burden for a lot of students.",
    "The class lasts for three and a half hours. The duration may be a little too long even though the discussion is necessary to help everyone to move forward with their projects. Luckily, breaks are often granted in the middle of the class to get snacks and drinks. The assignments are spaced out quite evenly though most put effort on the chapbook assignment 1 and little time was left to explore the film translation book and poster.",
    "The class had great projects that were all different enough that you felt like you were learning new skills each time. Critiques were also great, everyone always had very helpful and constructive advice\/suggestions. I think the biggest weakness of the class was it only being one day instead of two. We had so much work due each class that it was impossible to critique all of it. We had to communicate a lot through emails which makes it easier for messages to get lost."

    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in graphic design or the art of typography!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The work is rewarding, you learn a huge amount, and Professor Chungs dedication to her students shines through.",
    "Yes definitely recommend this course!! There were only strengths to the class, in which I learned more about graphic design from Professor Alice Chung in this class than any other class. Her incredible eye, brilliancy, generosity with her time, and hard work taught me so much. The only improvement I can imagine is having more time because we'd always run out of time during critiques.",
    "Yes! This course was a wonderful learning experience and anyone who is interested in design and typography will enjoy it. It was such a friendly and supportive classroom environment.",
    "This class is highly recommended to students who wish to know more about basic typography.",
    "Yes I would! Typography is so important to graphic design and this class can only help you as a designer. You also get a chance to really dive into the world of printing which can be a beast if you don't plan accordingly.",
    "Yes"
