    "A great seminar that I would recommend for anyone looking for an informative class with a really manageable work load.",
    "I would definitely recommend any seminar with DeCanio. You can't go wrong. It's so much fun and totally unique.",
    "Yes, this is a great class. It can be a little history-heavy and technical - you learn about the growth of bureaucracy in addition to the growth of parties. If you like political science and American history, you will probably like this course. I would definitely look into it. The readings were typical for a political science seminar and the term paper was pretty standard.",
    "I had trouble deciding whether or not to recommend this class. The readings are really heavy - basically a book of dry material a week - and I almost never was able to do it all. Sam was also hard to get in touch with outside of class, and was largely hands-off when it came to the paper. He is brilliant though, and it shows in class. I did enjoy class discussion, though it was very easy to get sidetracked, which I think would have been less likely had there been less reading and everyone had done it. While I did look forward to class every week, I was rarely prepared, which detracted from what I got out of it. Overall, I'd be hesitant to take it unless Sam decreases the workload in future semesters.",
    "Yes, it is a very good class! But do take one or two intro courses in American Politics before taking this class, in this way you can learn so much more!",
    "Yes! You learn so much about party formation- specifically the party ideology flip that occurred at the turn of the century, along with some theory on ideology formation and public opinion. Sam is fantastic- witty, cynical, and brilliant. As far as work is involved, it's not bad- read about a book a week and then write the final paper (get started early, or at least before finals week...).",
    "This course was focused a lot on how the political parties espoused different ideologies an how they may have changed over time. I would recommend this course to students who are interested American political history.",
    "This class is amazing. Great professor, decent readings and there's a common theme throughout the readings that makes you feel like you have actually progressed in understanding after having completed the course. Unlike most seminars within the major, I actually found the discussions to be pretty good. It's not because the class is a high pressure environment--Decanio is famously relaxed and happy to take twenty minutes to talk about the poor performance of Yale football before starting class--but because the material is genuinely interesting. The only criticism that I really have is that I wish we would have spent more than one session on Decanio's own manuscript. His book (not yet in published form) is really really good and deserved more than an hour and a half worth of discussion."
