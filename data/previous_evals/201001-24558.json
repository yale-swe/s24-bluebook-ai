    "You watch film noir movies, read criticism about them, and read the original books that they're based on. Don't expect to talk about actual film technique much -- mostly the discussions were thematic and dealt with character and context. Also there is an emphasis on the city and police force that I was not expecting. I took it Credit\/D\/F in my senior spring -- perfect class to do that with.",
    "This was probably my favorite course this semester, and I would definitely encourage anyone interested in classic films or Film Noir in particular to try to get into this course. The course is well-taught and meets for discussions once a week for two hours, with a film screening the night before. Discussions are very relaxed, and although it is necessary to give an in-class report, it is not a difficult assignment. Professor Trachtenberg is a pleasure to have as a professor, and the work load (mostly consisting of 2 papers throughout the semester and weekly readings) will not take up too much of your schedule. The films selected are excellent, the subject is intriguing, and the course is overall excellent.",
    "take it",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in watching a lot of old but great films and understanding more about the noir genre. Not much work though also not much cultural background.",
    "Watch great films, read great books, have great discussions.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The books and movies were interesting, but I didn't really feel that I got anything out of the class itself."
