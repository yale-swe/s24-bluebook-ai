    "Take this class. Professor Yeazell is beyond wonderful and the insights she has into the literature will really help you grasp each work in a deep way. If you are assigned her as an instructor, there is absolutely no reason to switch into another section. This was my favorite of the DS seminars, and, I think, reason to seriously consider enrolling in the program. The class revolves around studying and discussing many of the greats of classical literature, almost all of which you'll end up enjoying and some of which will (hopefully) strike you as very beautiful and worth continued study. Highly recommended.",
    "A look at Western literature from Homer to Dante. Incredibly broad, I know. I would absolutely recommend it, you basically become better read in a few weeks than most people will be in a lifetime.",
    "Granted that DS lit sacrifices depth for breadth, the course as a whole and Yeazell's section in particular were excellent. DS Lit has the best lectures of any of the fall DS classes. Yeazell is everything you could want in a section leader and more. Her style of leading section did an excellent job of hitting the major points and staying on topic while allowing students to express ideas and contribute to the direction of conversation. She took time to look up the answers to questions raised in class, which was always nice. She gave timely, fair and thorough essay feedback and was helpful in office hours. And she's nice. I know about the other teachers; none are better. TAKE IT WITH YEAZELL!!!",
    "If you are not thinking of majoring in the classics, do not take it. Everyone wants to pretend like they read the books, but it is almost impossible to read all the books for all three classes, plus the work of a fourth class, and still have a life. Most DS people are uptight anyway.",
    "Professor Yeazell makes DS definitely worth the effort. She is SO knowledgeable, and such a great section leader, and just an amazing person in general. If I could take DS for another semester with her, I would.",
    "This is a very useful class because pretty much every author since alludes to Homer, Virgil, or the Bible in some way or another. For this class, you cannot be in better hands if you have Professor Yeazell. She is extraordinarily knowledgeable about every work in the curriculum and is always warm and kind. I enjoyed going to this class every time. Professor Yeazell is also an insightful and fair essay grader.",
    "It's a great class because you're going to be well read coming out of it if you do the readings. Unfortunately, I felt like I didn't get a lot out of going to class and learned more studying for the final than I did the rest of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Although it is challenging, it is stimulating and interesting with an incredible professor.",
    "DS Lit with Professor Yeazell was fantastic. Never before have I had such stimulating conversation in a class before, while learning so much. Professor Yeazell is not easy, but she is fair, and will certainly help you a lot both in how you think about literature and how you write it.",
    "DS Fall Lit with Yeazell is a fantastic course! You are very lucky if you got Professor Yeazell, and will have a great semester. Even though there is a lot of reading, the Lit reading is always a nice change from the philosophical and political texts. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "Lots of reading and intense discussion. Don't expect to finish everything, but do realize that you'll get out what you put in.",
    "I would glowingly recommend this class to anyone interested in literature! The reading material is fabulous; that there are both lectures and seminars helps so much, since it means you get both the big picture and the opportunity to close read passages with a fabulous professor, and the seminars themselves are really engaging."
