    "I learnt basic concepts in ecology, which I believe will be a foundation for other courses I take.",
    "Extensions of basic ecological processes and concepts I had learned previously, introduction to case studies I did not know about previously. Knowledge about wind patterns and currents and how they affect the climate.",
    "The professor was very nice and kind. However, this was an extremely disappointing course. I think FES should STRONGLY consider eliminating this course as a core requirement as it is only relevant to small number of students who will work in biology, ecology, or land management. All of these students placed out of this course. The actual students in the classroom want to pursue careers in energy, business, law and a variety of other fields that are not overly related to ecology. This course stands in sharp contrast to Physical Science, where we learned lessons that can support a wide range of environmental managers. Additionally, almost everything we learned in Ecology was covered (way more effectively) in physical science. There really was no reason to take this course. The course felt very sloppily thrown together ans it seemed like very little thought or energy was invested into it. For example, we had our review for the final the night before the exam and the TAs still were not sure what would be on the exam. We received minimal feedback on our problem sets and whenever students had questions the Professor and TAs would point fingers at each other claim that the other knew the answer. The Professor and TAs were consistently not prepared to answer very basic and predictable questions on the course content and assignments. There is a reason under 1\/4 of the students actually showed up to the lectures. There are so many great offerings at FES. It does not make sense to pull students away from those courses where they can learn actual skills and force them to sit through this class that was worse than any high school science course I ever took.",
    "Though I did not attend some of the lectures, I actually found the course helpful in refreshing basic ecological concepts.",
    "Almost nothing.",
    "I gained rudimentary knowledge regarding ecological theory and limited empirical studies. This course provided me with a broad background of ecological concepts that will be useful in my future career.",
    "A big picture understanding of ecology.",
    "Basic understanding of ecological patterns and processes",
    "I re-established a solid background in ecology, as it had been some time since I had studied the topics covered here.",
    "This course provided a refresher on the principles of ecology.",
    "understood the importance of studying the scientific phenomena responsible for how the ecosystem functions and how climate change is a result of a change in these phenomena.",
    "Learned some very basic concepts in ecology and ecosystem biology. I don't think I developed any skills because the course seemed like a typical basic high school class where you sit in lecture, do the homework using the lecture slides and notes, memorize the content for the exam and, once the course is done, forget most of the content.",
    "Overview on basic ecological concepts."

   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "They aligned fairly well with my expectations.",
    "In the very first homework assignment, half of the assignment was based upon a pretty important climate and ecological phenomenon...that the professor maybe spoke three sentences about during class. Most of my learning for this class was spent searching the internet and articles for knowledge to answer homework assignments, while class presentations were less than useful - both unhelpful for the work and development of skills purportedly taught for this course, and also a time killer. At times, concepts explained in class might even become more confusing after explanation during lecture. It was when I realized all of this that I lost faith in this class. The cherry on top was that I understood the concept in that first homework assignment much better after a 30 minute lecture weeks later in the Physical Sciences basic knowledge course than I did after sitting through the lecture for this class and later studying on my own for the homework assignment. Many classmates started to skip lecture to do work for other classes, and I honestly think that may have been a better use of time.",
    "Not at all. This was the worst class that I've ever taken. The instructor barely knew the material and was awful at communicating it.",
    "I expected to gain a bit more from this course than I did. It seemed targeted towards student's putting in minimal effort to engaging with the material, and it didn't hold students very accountable for keeping up with the material. Therefore, I felt that the class went at a very slow pace. Furthermore, the assignments felt eerily similar to high school assignments. To properly answer many of the assignment questions would have required a term paper. However, minimal effort was expected, and therefore, it was difficult to gauge how much time to put into each question and how much google searching would really be appropriate to answer the question in its entirety. The questions and assignments should be improved in the future.",
    "The course material aligned with what I was expecting.",
    "Overall, the course introduced basic knowledge of ecology. I was hoping to get an overview of how ecology is related to and applied in the energy field, however we did not manage to cover that topic.",
    "Somewhat aligned - I expected the class to provide a basic introduction and it did, but the pace was not what I expected",
    "My expectations were met in this class",
    "This course did not feel like a graduate-level course. I could have had the same refresher through a summer reading or online course.",
    "I was glad to learn more about ecology and the course material was helpful.",
    "To be honest, very poorly. I understand the importance of understanding ecological processes for doing environmental work, but the course just seems to focus on knowledge useful for those who will work in conservation.",
    "Well aligned."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths- I liked the concepts and topics that were covered, they were quite interesting. Weaknesses- The content could have been more engaging.",
    "Strengths: Ease of getting information across, workload was manageable Weaknesses: I feel like the information could have been more advanced, classes were only lectures Improvements: guest speakers in the field, more clarity on assignments as well as more time to complete them, more interactive classes",
    "I think the major weakness the disorganized structure of the course. It attempts to cover too much information without coherent flow. The final exam covered too much information and was worth over 60% of the course.",
    "The final did not match the professor's description of the exam. The amount of material that we were expected to memorize for the final was extraordinary for a 1.5 credit class. Furthermore, the expectation of memorization is not conducive to actually learning the material.",
    "The instructor seems to think that when students didn't respond to questions it was because they didn't understand the course material. In reality, students stopped engaging because neither the lectures nor the questions asked during the lectures were thought provoking, and most people ceased to pay attention.",
    "Strengths: Going over concepts starting at a basic level. Weaknesses: Not enough engagement with material, poor assignments and poorly worded questions, too slow of a pace for the course (perhaps it could meet more than once a week?).",
    "The depth of class discussions was often much more basic than what was asked of us to know\/understand on assignments and the final exam.",
    "The professor was not engaging. Her own knowledge did not seem deep on the subject. The assignments asked for a level of detail and engagement with the material that was much greater than the teacher's engagement with the material.",
    "Strengths - Well structured Weaknesses - It could have been better linked with contemporary debates",
    "I enjoyed the course, but I think it should not be a requirement for certain specializations, like clean energy. I don't see the need for the knowledge I gained, even though the course was interesting.",
    "Strengths: Interesting case studies Weakness: - Pacing too slow, especially in first 5 weeks - During lectures, the lecturer was too focused on reading from slides - Instructions on problem sets were not clear, there was significant confusion about the questions - TA\/TFs were not well-briefed on the problem sets and expectations for the exam Improvement suggestions: - Since this is a foundations class, it would be useful for the lectures to be pre-recorded and require that students watch the videos prior to attending class (similiar to Shimon Anisfeld's Physical Science Foundations class). That way in-class lectures to be focused on reviewing and clarifying areas of uncertainty and ensuring understanding - Brief TA\/TFs on directions of the problem sets and exams ahead of time to ensure that they can fully assist students in need",
    "The lecture slides contained a lot of information which made note-taking difficult during class as I was unsure of what was the key\/most important information",
    "This course could be improved by making it more similar to the Physical Science class and\/or by making it a summer \/ online course.",
    "strengths: useful introduction to the subject weakness: took up time and credits in the semester, can do an online summer course instead and take the exam for credit after coming to FES so that students can focus on subjects they are interested in during the semster.",
    "Strengths: it requires very little time, which is appropriate for such an introductory\/basic course. Weaknesses: it felt like a high school biology class with high level scientific language. It lacks the dynamism and interesting content that should be characteristic of grad school. The days of sitting in lecture and memorizing stuff are long gone; for that matter I can just google concepts as and when I need them. Perhaps a flipped structure could work better, where students watch a video with the content of the lectures and then a discussion or a case study where the concepts are applied can happen during the class meetings.",
    "The course often felt like a disconnected bucket of facts. The rigor of the problem sets was often much higher than the engagement demanded during the lectures, which felt like a mismatch."

    "This is a good, basic-level class in ecology. The assignments are really helpful, so pay attention to them well.",
    "You probably have to take it because it is a basic knowledge class. However, if it's anything like this year's (and you have a choice not to take this course), you'd be better off taking a Physical Sciences course taught by Shimon Anisfeld.",

    "Will help clarify the basics, especially useful if interested in climate change solutions track, not directly helpful for business and the environment but necessary to understand how and why is the climate\/ecosystem changing due to humans,businesses.",
    "Unless i) you really want to know about basic ecology and conservation biology, or ii) you are required to take it as a basic knowledge course, don't take it."
