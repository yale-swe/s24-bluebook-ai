    "Yes, I would, but as I said above, a slightly altered reading list would be welcome.",
    "YES!",
    "yes, lots of interesting books",
    "I'd summarize it as \"Finding Puzzles in the Political Violence Literature\", and I found it quite helpful. While there has been an explosion of works on the topic, highlighting areas for further research, or that show the puzzles still unsolved, is a valuable step forward.Even if a fellow student was less interested in the topic, I'd state that Professor Kalyvas' approach to summarizing arguments, asking students to put things in terms their roommates could understand, and the importance of theory are all things political science could use more of.",
    "A broad survey of different types of visions of political violence. No real 'answers' to the underlying problems, just examining different approaches.",
    "This course mostly focused on civil wars rather than broader variety in political violence. The former and current practitioners in the course added a unique perspective missing from many political science classes at Yale. This course is more helpful for developing potential future research ideas than going in depth on any single aspect."

   "comments": [
    "This course was helpful in thinking about violence at the substate level. It may not directly contribute to my future research, but will help shape my thinking on other topics.",
    "This course provided foundational context for my research topic and methods.",
    "not really relevant to my field of study.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge by both providing a wide-lens of conflicts and approaches to understanding them. It was helpful for my research, because unlike most other courses I've taken this year, it helped me see how to find puzzles and questions worth writing on by reading widely.",
    "Kalyvas is one of the biggest names in the field and for good reason. Learned a tremendous amount from my time in his class.",
    "Absolutely helpful. This course allowed me to spend a lot of time learning about a particular area that I hope to spend much more time on in the future."
