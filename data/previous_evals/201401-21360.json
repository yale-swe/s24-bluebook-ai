    "If you like science and speak Italian, this is the course for you! We basically got to learn about a lot of large movements and ideas that sprouted in Italy as a direct response to the technological and scientific advancements of the time. This included anything from discussing Darwin to eugenics in Lombroso's theories and futurist literature and art. Definitely take it!",
    "I don't know when this will be offered again, but I'd recommend it to an Italian major. The readings are cool (especially futurists!!), and it's a course about a very different era of history than people are used to discussing. The workload isn't too bad, and the class conversations are chill."
