   "comments": [
    "If you are specifically interested in an IPA\/JPAL type job, take this course.",
    "No. As a Masters student for International Development and Economics, this course - primarily designed for undergraduate students - is not a suitable course to be made mandatory for the Masters program. Most of the concepts and papers that had been covered were already gone through in our undergraduate days when we were were taking poverty-related development economics classes (in preparation for this Masters program). Yes, there are some of us who have not taken Economics at an undergraduate level and also those who did not take development-Econ releated classes. But to make it mandatory for ALL students is not a good call in my opnion. The level of the class is too low for Masters standards. Would have appreciated an augmented version that would make it suitable for Graduate studies.",
    "Yes--as long as you are invested in RCTs.",
    "ECON 591 provides students with an in-depth understanding of RCTs, their importance, and how to use them. It also covers the use of RCTs in specific topics, such as health and education. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "It is a simple course that focuses on Randomized Controlled Trials as a means of evaluating poverty interventions.",
    "When I was taking the class, I didn't think it was useful. However, after the midterm, I started to realize how useful to understand RCTs, it's an immeasurable knowledge and skill. I am glad that I took it =)",
    "It's a highly relevant course to the current NGO context. Highly relevant and important to today",
    "You can learn the material within a few classes, beyond that the course is just a presentation of papers in the field. The issue is that multiple papers are presented in class to the point where they each receive about 5 minutes of attention. It would be much better to go through one or two papers in much greater depth, analysing why they undertook their research and the challenges that were faced, rather than just presenting the issue and the results.",
    "The course is interesting for students who do not yet have a lot of background in development economics. The title \"Economics of Poverty Alleviation\" may suggest a broader perspective than the one actually taken in lecture. Students should be aware that the course covers approaches that can be tested through Randomized Control Trials and is therefore limited in focus. Overall, the course provides a good overview of the \"state of the art\" of RCTs in many different fields of development, such as finance, education, and health.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for undergraduate students and for those who want to work in an NGO.",
    "Useful if biased look at rcts in a dev context.",
    "No"

   "comments": [
    "yes i think it did a good job of exposing us to RCT research in the field",
    "Did not contribute anything significant. Could have taken a more useful class, if not mandated to take this core class for my Masters program.",
    "I definitely came out more knowledgeable about RCTs. I feel more comfortable with running randomized control trials and evaluating them",
    "This course provided a great understanding of key topics in development economics, which is helpful in presenting myself as a knowledgeable professional.",
    "It did not.",
    "Gave me an understanding of the course literature, which i do not deny is incredibly useful, but that doesn't mean the course was good quality.",
    "The course is helpful to develop more routine in analyzing scientific papers. It is also good to practice writing concise papers. The course deepens one's knowledge of the concept and mechanics behind Randomized Control Trials.",
    "For someone wanting to go into research in development economics, a course taught by Dean Karlan is a treat. It is absolutely relevant in the sense of learning and application."
