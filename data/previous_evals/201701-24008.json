Perhaps assigning half the class to debate one side of an argument and the other half to support the other side. Or asking students to lead the discussions for each paper assigned could create more engagement. I think that Professor Zhao was incredibly helpful with the research assignment and helping me to improve my approach. I also appreciated the mini lectures and thought that they provided important context."

    "Absolutely recommend this class for anyone who is interested in a rigorous introduction to the economic challenges that China (and developing nations like it) faces. Professor Zhao is devoted to students' learning, and give clear feedbacks to all written assignments and research proposals. For someone interested in economics grad school like me, the class was an excellent opportunity to build a solid foundation for understanding China and to think up my own original research questions. My final project turns out to be something that I'm genuinely interested in, and I look forward to actually implementing it in the near future."
