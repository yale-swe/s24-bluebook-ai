    "Take it!!!!Good class!",
    "A decent overview of IR theory and applicable case studies. Howorth is an enjoyable lecturer. Shop TAs--grading really depends on their individual preferences, but overall, it's not hard and worthwhile for the beginner.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. It's not as gutty as it used to be, but it's a pretty cut and dry way to get a B+ and gain some solid core knowledge about current political events.",
    "I would recommend it if you like political science.",
    "Only take it if you need to fulfill PLSC requirements.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you want to learn aboutcurrent international affairs this is a great class. It is a great introductory course and it's not that hard a class. I think i learnt a lot from it. The lectures do get boring but some of the readings are interesting.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a decent, basic understand of IR.",
    "Fairly easy, low key class with a lot of unnecessary reading. If you're interested in the material, take it. it will be a good introduction. If not, there are probably more interesting options with less reading.",
    "A good introductory course, I would recommend it.",
    "A very shallow overview of a range of international topics and issues. Very good if you're looking to be able to chat about international relations casually, but far too simplistic to actually gain an understanding of the international system. If you have any polisci background from high school or read the news, skip ahead to a more sophisticated course.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking PLSC 111. It's a great overview class especially if you want to learn about the basis of what's going on in the world right now and how we can best approach these issues.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to understand both theory and practical cases. If you are already pretty knowledgeable in terms of theory you'll find the first half of the semester incredibly boring. Otherwise, it's a good way to expand your knowledge and analyze what you read in the news.",
    "This class is a good introductory class to IR but only if you don't have any basic knowledge of current events - otherwise it might not be worth it to take it. The beginning of the class is all IR theory, which is useful to discuss more countries later on but quite tedious. The lectures were interesting but it's hard to talk about so much information in such a short time.",
    "Average class. Only three exams and section, but there are a lot of readings and section can be tough depending on which TA you get.",
    "There are a lot of concepts that will be covered. The only reason I would recommend this class is because it is a prerequisite for majoring in Political Science.",
    "I think this is a good class to take as a freshmen",
    "Be prepared to either skip readings and pay extra attention during lecture and section or suffer through some very dry reading material. It is possible to get a good grade in the course without doing all of the readings as long as you attend class every day.",
    "An excellent course for poly sci and non poly sci students alike.",
    "The course is a great overview of the international community. Which section you are in has a HUGE affect on how much you will like the class.",
    "Take this class; it offers you a nice background knowledge about the entirety of international affairs. If you read newspaper regularly this class may be skipped, yet still the theory part and how they play into the real world interpretation is very elegant. I enjoyed this class a lot, and I look forward to a lot of classes like this in the future.",
    "take it if you need an intro poli sci course or just want a general overview of ir topics.",
    "This is a very easy class, but it's also fascinating. Professor Howorth is a great lecturer, and you will probably learn a lot without stress or much of a time commitment.",
    "ehhh i wouldnt take it again",
    "I'd say that one's assessment of the class is highly dependent on the section he or she is assigned to. The TF that heads your sections grades your tests, and depending on the strictness of each TF, you might dread section each week, or you might find it a complete breeze.",
    "yes sure, if you are interested in learning about foreign policy. I knew none before and have a great background so am happy for that",
    "It gives you a general understanding of world affairs. Best used as a precursor to more intense global affairs courses. But it's not the most engaging class.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone looking for a very general intro to international relations.",
    "I would not recommend it to a fellow student. The class could be much more interesting than it actually is right now and I think it is a waist of time and money to take this class when there are other great classes being offered.",
    "If you don't know a great deal about international relations, this is a great way to get in touch with current events and major themes. If you know a lot about IR already, though, beware that this course is really, really easy. It is a perfect simple fifth class if you're looking for a relevant, interesting, but not-too-challenging intro lecture.",
    "very relevant material. you go topic by topic (China, Arab Spring, Terrorism...) with readings that let you go as in depth as you want",
    "This is a pretty easy class, with only a midterm and a final. You definitely do not need to go to every section or do every reading. A lot depends on your TA, as they grade your exams, and it seems as though there is a lot of variation in how harshly they grade them. The information is pretty straightforward, and sometimes interesting. The first half of the course is very theoretical, while the second half goes into more modern day, real world issues, and then applies the theories to them.",
    "GREAT SURVEY OF AND INTRODUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.",
    "I would recommend Political Science 111 01 to another student because it is interesting and not too much work compared to other courses.",
    "great way to learn the basics of IR",
    "Great class to learn more about foreign policy of nations and how inter-state relations have been shaped overtime.",
    "I recommend this course, especially to freshmen\/sophomores, who want a broad overview of international relations. Exams are not too difficult, and the reading is very manageable. It is not the most interesting course I've taken at Yale, but it provided basic knowledge about current events and theory. If you are an avid newsreader, you will know a lot of this information already.",
    "good course if you are interested in IR and want to get to the basics.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course. The subject matter was interesting, the readings were, on the whole, engaging and the lectures were lively. This course is great for anyone interested in improving their knowledge of political matters that are so central in today's world.",
    "The concepts aren't hard to understand, but unless you have a good understanding of current events and international relations, this is NOT a gut class. You need to incorporate details in your answers to the exams to get full credit, and the readings were more important than I expected them to be. Most of the TFs were good and directed you to what you need to know. If there were assignments, they were assigned by TFs and pretty simpleA lot of what you learn is IR theory--like the difference between realist and liberal analysis. However, you do learn a lot of concrete stuff, especially after the first midterm, especially if you do the reading.Take this if you want to become better at discussing world politics, but not if you just want a gut class. You can get a B without much work, but an A requires more effort.",
    "Good, basic overview of international relations, although it doesn't go much depth into anything. Howorth is an entertaining and engaging professor, and I enjoyed going to most of his lectures.",
    "This class is a good one to take if you've never taken IR before, and want an intro to the theory behind IR. It's also good at giving brief overviews of important case studies for today, including the Arab Spring, China's rising economic power, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Howorth is an engaging professor as well, and I feel a lot more confident with dinner politics. The tests are generally easy, and the readings are pretty interesting.",
    "Very broad intro class without much depth. Lectures are generally interesting but the theories can get boring. You can skip the readings and still know whats going on in class. Exams were manageable.",
    "IR is a must take. Professor is great and the material is interesting and useful.",
    "Intro to IR is a good class for people wanting to get a better understanding of current global affairs. I would recommend it to others.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, gives a solid intro to theory and important contemporary issues. Howorth is a good lecturer.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material. It'll make you a LOT more knowledgeable about things going on in the world. Go to lectures, do (most of) the readings, pay attention. It's a pretty easy course too, and not that difficult to get an A in.",
    "This class has really interesting material, and I'm glad I took it. The tests can be unfair and arbitrary, and you ultimately have to memorize facts and regurgitate them if you want to stand out, which is pretty sad. Go to lecture because repeated exposure is key for this stuff.",
    "Good class for a non-major looking for a little variety in their schedule. Very little work and the midterms aren't too crazy. I actually feel like I learned some useful things in this class.",
    "Yes, not a particularly interesting course but not too much work",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. It's not a challenging workload, and the information is very valuable.",
    "One of the easiest courses I have taken at Yale, but still a solid course. I took this course as a junior Political Science major looking for focused instruction in IR theory, and while I did find some of that, the treatment of both the theory and the empirical cases was definitely rather shallow. That being said, this is a great chill 5th credit, and if you are unfamiliar with the way the world works, I would advise taking it, if only because of Howorth's adorable Aussie accent.",
    "This course was an overview of international relations, and covered a lot of current topics. It was really interesting, although it was a lot of information, and it was hard to tell what was needed for the exams. The classes are interesting and the sections let you talk about current events, which is fun. There is a mandatory weekly section, 2 midterms, and a final. The tests aren't hard at all, so overall, this is a pretty easy class.",
    "I would summarize Political Science 111 01 as an absolutely excellent and very interesting course giving a great overview of international relations, providing just the right amounts of breath and depth in both theoretical and imperialtopics in the discipline. I would definitely recommend Political Science 111 01 to another student, for reasons I have outlined above. It is a great course that teaches you so much so quickly about international relations, providing an overview of they schools of theory and then also delving into key cases in the discipline, describing both their historical context and background and the cases being debated today. I found it a very engaging course that was easy to follow but nonetheless very interesting and both presented and provided the opportunity for analysis at quite a high level for an introductory course. This was my favorite course this semester, and I would highly recommend it to any other student, whether or not he or she has any significant interest in or real prior knowledge of international relations.",
    "This course gave a brief overview of many important topics in International Relations today. Professor Howorth is quite dull (he actually reads verbatim from his lecture slides) but the material is interesting and important to know. The class is NOT a gut anymore. Section leaders expect you to read the material (of which there is a lot) and the grading on the midterms and final is not easy. Recommended but not super necessary to attend lecture - just do the reading and review the lecture slides afterwards.",
    "I thought this was a pretty poor class. It was simultaneously a lot of work, and not much challenge. I didnt feel pushed at any point and it was mostly just memorizing facts. There was also too much study of theory and not enough actual theorizing. It was like they didnt trust us to think on our owns. It's a lot of reading so if you're looking for a gut, this isnt it. At the same time, its not challenging so you get stuck with the most undesirable aspects of classes at Yale... enjoy!",
    "This is a good intro poli sci course. It focuses on theory and on real world events half and half. Section is interesting and so is the material. However, doing all the readings is not necessary.",
    "An interesting and relatively easy class (helpful if you want to learn more about current events). Some of the readings are repetitive (there are a lot of readings from 2 texts, but you probably only need to look at 1 or neither or them), but they are also interesting at times. There are only 3 evaluations (2 midterms and a final), but they are all very straight forward.",
    "A class that covers basic IR theory, the roles of state and non-state actors, and several case studies of countries and how they interact in the IR arena. I would recommend this class to another student, especially those interested in IR or polysci.",
    "Honestly, probably not. The course is very easy, so if you're looking for a gut, then I suppose this might be for you. I wish that I would have taken Global Affairs, since my friends in that course always seemed to be working on some difficult yet interesting assignment. I don't feel like I learned that much in this course, and some of that is probably my fault. Still, I don't think I'd recommend this course.",
    "Overall, a strong introduction to international relations theory, and a great crash course in understanding the world for those of us who may be tempted to live in the Yale bubble and forget about the vastly complex and ever-changing world around us.",
    "International Relations is an excellent way to explore political science. The course begins with a heavy emphasis on theory, but then spends the second half of the term applying the theory to case studies. I would recommend this course if you are interested in global politics or are thinking about possibly majoring in political science.",
    "I read this before I took the class and it was absolutely true again: it is hard to very well but also very hard to do poorly. Professor Howorth was a good lecturer and the lectures were interesting. I went to all lectures even though you could easily get by without going. All grading is done by your TA and can be very arbitrary based on the grader. I learned a good amount, and the class serves as a good introduction to theory of international relations.",
    "Except for the theory in the beginning, a lot of the information in the class could be learned if you keep up with the New York Times and international news. If you're someone like me who is trying to start following and analyzing current events more then this class could be really great for you.",
    "I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class, but know that it's a good class, not great. Howorth is an enjoyable lecturer, and everything you learn (nuclear proliferation, the EU, the UN, civil wars, Arab Spring, China, Iraq, etc), is very important. But the class is so broad that it is difficult to delve into any one topic. However, it's a worthwhile intro class.",
    "This is a really excellent introductory course. Those with some knowledge of current IR trends and country-specific issues may find that most of the material is familiar to them, but the opportunity to study and discuss it in a formal context will still probably do them some good. A particular benefit of this course is the early focus on theoretical approaches to IR -- this provides a vocabulary and an intellectual framework for the discussion of specific countries and specific events. Prof. Howorth is an interesting, opinionated lecturer, although, as is the case with most large lecture courses, the TAs do all the grading. Readings are manageable and often fascinating, and run the gamut from easy interested-general-audience articles (\"10 Things You Didn't Know About the War on Terror\") to dense and technical chapters from theoretical handbooks (\"Transnational Actors and World Politics\"). There is no paper assigned -- and I found myself thinking that this was a missed opportunity. A policy paper or a country-specific study would have been an interesting challenge. :) This fun course is highly recommended for pretty much anybody, though freshmen, in particular, may find it a nice, not-too-stressful introduction to the study of poli-sci in college.",
    "A great introductory course that provides a broad background of international relations, including its theories, history and current state. The lectures are very engaging, the workload is only reading, and overall a fairly low-key yet interesting and rewarding course. Would definitely recommend even for people who aren't intending to major in IR-related fields but would like some exposure to international relations.",
    "YES TAKE IT.",
    "I would recommend this class. The exams were very fair and the subject matter was very interesting.",
    "It's a great course to take if you're interested in current events and long to know more about the foreign policy of states.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student. It is very interesting and not too challenging. The format of the exams is very easy and Professor Howorth is great.",
    "I would recommend",
    "it's alright. make sure you do the major readings that your TA tells you to, and you'll be good on that front. no need to to all of them, but definitely know key ideas from lecture! this course is very broad and if you dont know much about IR its a bit overwhelming.i went into this class with very little IR knowledge, so it was hard to take in all the detailed information at once. but its a good class to take Cr\/D. really interesting material though! and prof howorth is awesome, although he mumbles sometimes and his accent is sometimes hard to understand.",
    "Yes, this class is interesting and a good overview of world events. Two mid-terms, and a final plus section requirements.",
    "This course is a good introduction to political scienceand it provides a good overview of topics such as the Iraq War and humanitarian intervention. I feel like I can use this class as a basis for other courses that focus on specific topics, so I would recommend this to students who want to have a good introduction into the area of political science.",
    "Its an easy class that you can just watch The West Wing as a study tool. If you have any knowledge of world history and current events you'll be fine without any real studying. Take it only if you want a worthless class.",
    "I would not recommend Intro to IR to another student. I heard that it was an easy A as long as you went to lecture while also being an interesting class. This year the class was significantly harder (especially if your TF like mine was a really tough grader). And the tests were not based on the lecture, they were based on looooong readings. So even going to see Howorth lecture wouldn't even help my grade enough to make it worthwhile. I guess they wanted to send a message that this is no longer a gut, and at least to me they did, but it was not worth working that hard for such a boring class.",
    "Easy class but it will take a lot of your own initiative to make it interesting and fruitful.",
    "Intro to IR is really what it seems to be: an introduction to the main issues in the world today while also touching on the underlying reasons for why the world is what it is. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student if they are interested because of the subject and the professor.",
    "A great overview class of basic IR concepts and current events. Not in-depth, but a good intro",
    "A great course for students who follow current affairs and wish to gain a deeper understanding of the theories and politics behind those issues. Take this course if you are curious about various reasons of why the war in Iraq failed, or if you want to learn how China's ascent is affecting current global politics. Suchitra Vijayan is an engaging but intense section leader. If you are looking to really grasp the coursematerial, take IR with Suchitra. If you are more interested in gaining a basic intro to world affairs, take the class with one of the more laid-back TAs such as Kyle Poorman. I attended his section several times, and he covers topics appropriately and easily, particularly for those students who have never taken much of an interest in following current events or reading the NY Times."
