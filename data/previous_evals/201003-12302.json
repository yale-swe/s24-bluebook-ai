   "comments": [
    "Yes. It wasn't too intense but the readings were really interesting and changed my perspective on humor completely",
    "Yes, best pure Spanish class I have taken since I got to Yale. A lot of liberty for final project which is great, and understudied field when looking at humor.",
    "Yes, I absolutely recommend it. The professor is amazing, the topic is very interesting and unique, and the readings are hilarious.",
    "Take it. The workload's very light for a Spanish lit class--two 5-page papers and one 15-pager at the end (graded pretty generously)--and class is very chill.",
    "Humor in Spanish American Literature is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Gonz\u00e1lez is incredibly knowledgable and nice and the readings are always interesting. This course introduced me to a new way of thinking about the role of literature in society and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a great survey of humorous Latin-American authors, many of whom haven't been translated into English yet. The readings are fun, the discussions are interesting, and the professor is great.",
    "Please see response 1.",
    "Spanish 343 was a fantastic course, truly an enlightening experience for literal interpretation. I would recommend it to anyone that has an interest in Spanish literature and its unique qualities.",
    "This class was pretty good, I would recommend it. The readings are great and definitely manageable. And Prof. Gonzalez Perez is really sweet and totally cool. Just be warned that it's more of a lecture and not really a seminar, so class can feel a little long."
