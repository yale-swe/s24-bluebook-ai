I thought the course gave the students an important opportunity to improve and practice our writing skills. The course furnished me with some interesting insights into how history can be used as a methods of analysis to better undertake effective decision-making."

   "comments": [
    "This course should not be solely focused on Europe. The absence of non-European perspectives on major world events like both World Wars is off-putting to many students.",
    "The course would benefit from a longer extended class time in smaller groups: two hour seminars with class sizes of around 15 students. More student discussion of the material should be encouraged. Simulations should be more structured, with clearer expectations.",
    "The strengths lay in the instructors' ability to make the most difficult material accessible and also have a comprehensive reading list for the class.",
    "The main strength of the course was the simulations, which gave me the opportunity to practice and improve my public speaking and negotiation skills. The main weakness of the course was a lack of detailed feedback on the numerous written assignments."

    "yes",
    "Being a compulsory closed course, this one cannot be recommended to non-Jackson scholars. I would have loved to do so and know of people who would have liked to attend the class as well."
