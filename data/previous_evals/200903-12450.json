    "This class ended up being more of an art-focused course. There was a good blend of science and art students in our class which made discussion interesting and detailed. While there was a good amount of reading, it was interesting to read. The writing assignments, while pertinent, sometimes felt disjointed from actual class lecture. While I enjoyed the class I know several of my classmates didn't. I'm glad I took this course, and you should definitely take a freshmen seminar, but if you are much more interested in the science half of the course, you may be in for disappointment.",
    "this course basically gives an overview of similarities\/differences between aspects of science and art, including perspective, objectivity, color, and abstraction, as well as historical intersections between the two fields. this course is good for students who have little background in art history and who are interested in science as well as humanities. also, students don't really need to do any of the readings to do well in the class",
    "I would say it is up to you to do with this class what you will. If you want a class that is inherently entertaining, this is not it. But if you are looking for a class that deals with some pretty cool concepts every once in a while and lets you choose your level of involvement, this is it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student who was interested in Art History. Otherwise, this course might be too specific.",
    "Overall, the course wasn't that bad but wasn't extremely enjoyable either. I would only recommend it to people if you already have a good foundation in both art (especially art history) and science. There were times where I wished I'd learned more basic art history.",
    "Art and Science is meandering around Prof. Armstrong's favorite texts and images without a background in art history but also without real science. Honestly, the class is what you make of it. You could do all the readings and gather so much information, but never apply it, or you could not do the readings at all and not suffer. The class meetings were usually pretty boring, but the field trips were awesome. Armstrong told us that we took more field trips than any other class at Yale. We went to really cool places, like the scientific glass blowing studio, the YUAG conservation labs, a sculptor's house and much more. I told a family member about the class and he said, \"Oh, it's like first grade with bigger words.\" I'd say that description is apt - the class was fun but not intellectually rigorous.",
    "this course is just fabulous. if u have spent half of ur high school life emulating Manet or messing with Calcium Carbonate, this is the course for u.The work load varies like a rolller coaster. u need to put a lot of effort to get a good grade on paper but if u start earrly, u can get through them without being extra regular on your readings.",
    "I would not recommend this course"
