   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this seminar to another student but I would advise them that most of the other students were already knowledgeable about the law. That can be intimidating but we are all digital users, and so we all have something to add to the discussion whether it be a personal interpretation of a strict jurisprudence one.",
    "I highly recommend the class! The professor is knowledgable, engaging, and and a great teacher. I hope Civil Liberties in the Digital Age is taught again; the subject matter is incredible important for a US citizen in the 21st Century, and the class discussion is very enjoyable. If it is, you should definitely try to make a schedule that allows you to take it!",
    "If you're interested in looking at how civil liberties are changing in the era of modern technology, take the class. The readings are interesting, and there are a lot of interesting points brought up in class discussion. There are weekly reading responses on the class blog, a midterm paper (10 pages), and a final paper (15 pages). Anjali is also a sweetheart and made it a great class as long as you are interested in and engaged with the material.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar to anyone interested in law, the Constitution, or how law interacts with technology. This class does a good job mixing the more philosophical questions about the role of law and the Constitution and the more specific questions about the current law and how it relates to cyberspace.",
    "This is an excellent seminar. Anjali Dalal is fantastic, and the class is a wonderful opportunity to discuss constitutional law for a couple hours each week. The material is really interesting, and you come away from it with your opinions, if not more solid, certainly better informed. Be aware that there is quite a bit of reading, some of it rather dense and legal. If this is a problem for you, think twice before taking this course - otherwise, I very strongly recommend it."
