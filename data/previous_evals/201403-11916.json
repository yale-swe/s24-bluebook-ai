    "Spanish 1 is what you want to take to begin Spanish. I took French in high school and found that this course setup was much easier to learn with. Jose was unbelievably good and the course was great. Some thought that we had a lot of work, but I didn't have to spend much time at all.",
    "Spanish 110 covers present tense and some of the past tense. I would recommend this course to another student because it is a good way to get immersed into a language. However, I think that many students avoid taking this course for their personal enjoyment because you can only get credit for it upon completion of Span 120.",
    "Spanish L1 introduces the basics of the Spanish language. It starts with simple communication words and then builds up to more \"advanced\" verb conjugations. The chapters are generally themed over an activity. Quizzes were mostly fair, but the final was significantly stronger than the tests.",
    "I think I am reasonably good at languages, and I almost wish I had just taken intensive spanish instead because it would have moved a little more quickly. However, I think 110 is a really good intro class.",
    "Spanish sucks. Lots of memorization, little intellectual content. One of the most painful parts of the course was that they made us learn about how great and important all the (third world) spanish speaking countries are. Basically like a high school class in every way--meets every day, lots of memorization, and its all material I could (and should) have learned 3-4 years ago. We were even treated like a bunch of untrustworthy adolescents during the final exam--only one person (of ~120 students) could go to the bathroom at a time, no one was allowed to sit in the back row because it was \"dark\", and a teacher came around to see each students name and ID. If you have to take a language and you really want to take spanish (or if you--like some people in my L1 class--took spanish for 3-4 years in high school and want an easy class), then take it with Jose Simonet. He was a great professor and made it less miserable.",
    "SPAN 110 is an introductory course in Spanish which teaches students the basics of the language and provides them a strong foundation for learning more Spanish. It is fun and easy to understand while still teaching a lot. The work is constant but never overwhelming."
