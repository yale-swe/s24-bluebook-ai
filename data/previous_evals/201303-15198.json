   "comments": [
    "Pretty much only take this course if you absolutely must. Although I love calculus, this course made me love it a little less. The material usually isn't too difficult to comprehend, but you'll likely be required to teach some of the material to yourself.",
    "Only take this class if you can get a good teacher. If you're stuck with a grad student, your class will be taught directly out of the textbook. The material in Math 120 is not extremely difficult once you get the intuition for the formulas you're using, but if you don't have a good teacher you won't get a strong fundamental understanding of what you're doing, and it will come back to bite you on the tests. If you do end up with a bad teacher, I recommend spending the two and a half hours a week watching KhanAcademy Calc instead of going to class.",
    "I really struggled with this course throughout most of the semester. My advice would be to make sure you get yourself a good teacher whom you understand. The amount oftime and effort people spend on the problem sets (which can be quite challenging) is also worth way more than just 10% of the grade. If you choose to enroll in this course, make sure you are confident that you will be able to understand the material. Also, bear in mind that you may be learning with those who already took multi variable before.",
    "I would say that they should take it if they think they would feel comfortable in a fast-paced math class which requires a lot of self-teaching",
    "Math 120: Multivariable CalcRecommendable if you get a good section teacher.",
    "I would recommend MATH 120 to others, if they enjoy math. Also, if they have a good teacher, I think this course has potential to be very good.",
    "I would not recommend Math 120. I would say to go with a class like ENAS 151, which is taught by an actual professor. Be careful about taking this class as a pre-med; while the Multivariable concepts themselves are not too difficult, many of my classmates had already taken Multivariable in high school. The grading is very strict and the curves are rather steep.",
    "I would recommend this class simply because the material is just so powerful and useful. If you enjoyed single variable calculus you will find that the math in this course is a very natural and very elegant extension of that material, although obviously there are key difference between multi and single which make the problems very devious, especially by the end of the course when you are deep into surface integrals.",
    "I would recommend it for people who are interested in math or science. It's challenging, but the concepts are very useful."
