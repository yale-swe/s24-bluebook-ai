    "I found this class to be great for an overview of argumentation in classic philosophy but not really a class where students got to discuss or evaluate the premises themselves. We asked Professor Hare a lot of questions which he answered well but I feel we could've gone further in relating the texts to each other. Professor Hare is clearly descended from the gods. He is the Gandalf and Dumbledore hybrid of any kid's dreams. For this reason its easy to put him on a pedestal and feel wildly inferior. He was very clear in answering our questions but not as adept at sparking discussion or conversation over controversial topics covered this semester. It felt a little bit like a lecture class, but I can't complain because everything Hare said should be written down and distributed to the masses. He's clearly a humble, hilarious genius.",
    "A challenging but rewarding course. Personally I think that philosophy was much more difficult than H\/P and Lit, and you can't really skim the philosophy readings and expect to have a good understanding of them, whereas with the other two courses you can. But because the readings are so challenging, the course becomes more interesting and deciphering the ideas during section is always engaging. So even though the work takes longer for philosophy, you end up getting more out of it. The course offers exposure to a wide variety of viewpoints and examining the different schools of thought in philosophy really defines the DS experience.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! DS Philosophy is a mind-blowing course in which you come to understand the main principles of the founding philosophers. Seeing the connections between the different philosophers and the conversations between their works is incredible (often confusing) but rewarding. Also, take this with Professor Hare if at all possible! He is a FANTASTIC teacher--I am in awe of his brilliance. He knows so much and shares his immense knowledge in a clear, engaging manner.",
    "DS Philosophy is interesting and provides a helpful understanding of how philosophical thought changed from Plato to Aquinas. The texts are complex and difficult to understand, but working through them in section and hearing about them in the lectures is extremely helpful. Professor Hare is clearly a brilliant scholar and his lectures to all of DS are some of the best. His classes are interesting and he knows so much about Aristotle and Plato that it's incredible to listen to him answer questions. Having him as a freshman in a small class is a unique experience. That being said, he will grade your essays very harshly and will provide very little feedback on them. Be prepared to work very hard on your papers and struggle to get time with him outside of class even during office hours.",
    "I would recommend this class as giving one the basis of philosophical study.",
    "I would definitely recommend this section of DS philosophy, and DS in general. It's a great overview to early thinkers, although with Hare's question-answer style section I'd say it might not be the greatest if you have never done philosophy before. I feel like I would have grown more in the class and been pushed more if I'd had to answer questions, instead of mostly just ask them. That being said, Hare is an incredibly thoughtful and brilliant professor, and this class is a solid introduction to early philosophy- I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy is an excellent class. You will survey Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicurus, and the Christian philosophers, and the workload is very manageable. Philosophy is unlike Literature and Historical and Political Thought because your analytical skills will be stretched in a new direction, toward the specific construction of arguments. For me personally, philosophy was the most difficult section for Fall DS largely because the reading is the most complex and difficult to follow. If you have the chance, switch into Professor Hare's section! Professor Hare's way of running section is phenomenal! Framing class around 3 questions and having Professor Hare work the room like a Q&A session with brief points is ideal for a class aiming to teach complex ideas to students (myself included) who have not read many of these texts before. Especially compared to other sections, there was little to no pontification from the students, which I greatly appreciated, and Professor Hare's explanation of Aristotle, Plato, and the like was very coherent, approachable, and digestible to a novice philosophy student. He is a tough grader (do not expect an A), but his method is very clear. I sometimes thought Hare himself was Aristotle or Plato because his command of the text is excellent, and he can explain the concepts so thoroughly and clearly. If you plan on taking DS, you really need to switch into Hare's section. He is, quite simply, the best.",
    "DS Philosophy is probably the most difficult of the DS classes, but it may be the most rewarding. The ideas that you study in Philosophy inform both of the other classes and help you get a lot more out of the literature and political thought than you might otherwise. John Hare is a great professor to have for section. He usually does a lot of talking, but it's worth it to hear his explanations, especially of Aristotle, who he loves.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class because of the thought provoking nature of the texts and discussions, but most especially because of the thought-provoking ideas introduced by Professor Hare.",
    "I think DS Philosophy provided me with a really strong foundation in the philosophy of the Western Canon, and it definitely piqued my curiosity moving forward. I think the course is well structured and it's a wonderful introduction to thinking philosophically."
