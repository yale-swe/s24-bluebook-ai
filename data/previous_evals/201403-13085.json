    "English 114 with Dr. Hopper was great. I came into the class unsure if I would enjoy the course material but class discussions and readings were very engaging and intriguing. Dr. Hopper is fun and fair and introduces interesting topics. Definitely would recommend taking this class, especially if you're looking for a writing credit or to just improve your writing in general. You have to work hard for an A, but otherwise, an A- is very manageable.",
    "This is a GREAT intro to writing course ESPECIALLY if taken with DR. HOPPER!! She is incredibly accessible, receptive to criticism and student's suggestions, and is helpful to anyone who needs it! Dr Hopper is engaging, fun and fosters a true community spirit within the classroom environment. This class is worth it, as the workload is not terrible and the work really pays off. Your writing will sustain an incredible improvement and Dr. Hopper will be there for questions and help along the way. TAKE IT!",
    "In summation, ENGL114 07 was a phenomenal course. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as I learned and excelled in writing as a result of the class",
    "Yes. Dr. Hopper is the best and will mold you into a better writer.",
    "I would recommend this course, the subject is really interesting and the professor is very good. Class is very discussion based and very informal."
