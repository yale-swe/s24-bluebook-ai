    "This is a pretty chill lab. With the re-structuring of the E&EB major it will likely attract less students, but it's definitely not a bad option if you need it for a pre-med requirement or something. Some of the experiments (especially the computer simulations) were a bit inane, and the lab reports required quite a bit of statistical analysis and were thus time consuming, but overall the lab itself was pretty fun and relaxed.",
    "EEB 226L is a relaxing lab that is usually very small. Our year there were 7 students in the class, which was great. The experiments are all interesting and informative, definitely not wastes of time like other labs in other classes. Make sure you read the assigned literature papers! It can get really uncomfortable if you don't.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot of great things and it's small enough for personalized attention and close relationship with your lab mates.",
    "A nice lab that only requires 6 lab reports. Interesting material, and not too tough. I would recommend this lab. The experiments are pretty fun, and there is a great collegial atmosphere!",
    "Overall, this was a great course that provided a good introduction to key principles in evolutionary biology. The hands-on aspect that taught us techniques such a PCR, artificial selection, and viral assays were particularly rewarding. The class was lighthearted overall. There was virtually no work for this lab except on days when lab reports were due (mostly in the second half of the semester). When lab reports were due, most students put them off until the night before, and the 7- or 8-hour reports would take us almost all night, so beware of that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you're taking the lecture."
