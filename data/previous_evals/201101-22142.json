    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! You won't regret it :)",
    "Improves your reading and vocabulary, especially traditional characters.",
    "Great to continue work in Chinese.",
    "the class is decent. your chinese won't improve much, but it will keep you in practice. you won't get much of a chance to talk and classes will often feel disorganized and unfocused. learning traditional characters is a pain but a good skill to have. there aren't many other options at yale for high level chinese classes, so this may be your best option.",
    "I would highly recommend it! Very entertaining! Su Wei is so funny and loves telling stories.",
    "Overall good overview of contemporary Chinese issues, i.e. politics and the economy. Goes over some Chinese philosophy as well. Su wei is hilarious and tells lots of stories in class, but workload is not light.",
    "Only if you really are into Chinese. it is not a really good class but better than the first semester.",
    "This class is really just Professor Su Wei telling his stories. He has great stories, but if you want practice or if you want class to be relevant to the course syllabus\/what is tested in the exams, don't take this.",
    "I would recommend this class, but it really depends what you're interested in getting out of it. It won't really help your speaking very much. Su Laoshi is great and very entertaining, but he likes to talk a lot, so it doesn't leave you very many opportunities to improve your speaking. But if you're interested in learning some interesting things about Chinese culture and forcing yourself to learn traditional characters (the textbook is in traditional this semester...), then it should be an interesting class.",
    "Definitely take the course if you want to improve your traditional Chinese."
