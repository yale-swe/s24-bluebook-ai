    "BEST CLASS EVERRRRRRR!totally take it. reasons for taking it:1) The Professors: You get to spend Thursday evenings in the company of 2 of 4 rotating professors who are powerhouses of the MB&B department. I already miss Professor Grindley's distinctive laugh, Professor Soll's amazing anecdotes, Professor Hochstrasser's nuggets of wisdom& Professor Koleske's nerdy trivia facts.2) The Students: Class was small this year: only 8 students. But we were 8 students who were very passionate about science, and it was amazing to be in the company of true scholars.That said, it's tough. You should have taken Biochem already, and you should be prepared to work. You read 2 papers every week, and need to understand them solidly going into discussions.",
    "Definitely take it - the professors are great, the papers are interesting, and this is an experience that you won't get at any other point being a science major!",
    "Methods and Logic is a course focused on primary source reading and learning methods than can be applied to newer questions in science. It's great for learning a bit more about the scientific process, and forces you to apply what you're learning. Great class.",
    "This class is excellent. Each week we read 2 papers with a common scientific theme. On Tuesday you meet with the other students and talk about the details of the paper. On Thursday, two of the professors ask questions about the logic of the research, and what results you can actually conclude about the papers. It makes you think critically much more than you would in other classes, and develops your ability to talk intelligently about science. Definitely take it.",
    "If you would like to learn what an elegant experiment looks like, take this class! It teaches some of the ways scientists have been thinking about biochemistry over the past half-century. The science may be old, but the reasoning is deathless.",
    "This is essentially a seminar for biochemistry students. The professors are all very good and provide a multi-dimensional perspective on the logic behind biochemical research. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is willing to carefully read each of the papers.",
    "This was the best course I've taken at Yale. I've never said that about a class before. Take it -- no matter how inconvenient its time and location... You WILL be intimidated, you WILL feel pretty stupid half the time, but you'll understand molecular biology in a way that's more satisfying than...well, anything."
