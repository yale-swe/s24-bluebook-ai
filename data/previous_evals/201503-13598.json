    "Yes, for sure.",
    "A good foreign language course with a great instructor. Workload is reasonable considering it meets every day.",
    "Great class to take if you're at an intermediate Spanish level. Professor Reymundi is funny and engaging, and she really cares about her students' success. If you want to learn Spanish or need to take it for the language requirement, I would definitely recommend her class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has experience with Spanish in the past, but doesn't feel like they have too much confidence or technical proficiency. This course is rightly called \"Intermediate Spanish,\" and I think it was exactly what I needed to advance my skills.",
    "Most people take it because they have to, not by choice. I would only recommend to someone who didn't need it for requirements if they really loved the language.",
    "It's a lot of talking to your classmates in Spanish, which I found very fun",
    "It's Spanish class. Take it if you took Spanish in high school."
