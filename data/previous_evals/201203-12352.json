   "comments": [
    "This is a little known gem! How often did I mention what I was taking to receive blank stares! Its off the beaten path, and I suggest everyone try it or something like it.",
    "This is a great art history course, but you would do well to take an intro class or two before tackling this one, as prior knowledge of basic art history is often assumed.",
    "The first half of the course is about Minoan and Mycenaean (early Greek) art, with a specific focus on Thera, an island that was buried in a volcanic eruption. The second half of the course is about Roman art, focusing on Pompeii and Herculaneum, two cities which were also buried in a volcanic eruption. The volcano lens is a very interesting one through which to look at these civilizations' art. I would recommend this class, for it is well taught and interesting.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! It's a chill class in which you learn quite a lot! I'd never heard of Minoan culture until I took the class, and I found it all fascinating! The work is pretty standard--a midterm, a paper, and a final, plus weekly reading assignments. Totally doable for people with a busy schedule who are looking for a humanities credit. Would definitely reccommend!",
    "This is a wonderful class; a hidden gem. Professor Foster is intelligent, funny, and approachable. I can't imagine not loving this class if ancient art appeals to you. It's not that much work, but you get a lot out of it. However, I could imagine the content boring people to tears if they're not truly interested in ancient art and so I would proceed with that in mind."
