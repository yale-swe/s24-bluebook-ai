   "comments": [
    "I really would not recommend this course to another student. I often find that doing the problem sets really just requires better mathematical knowledge and a good math background rather than actually understand the economic concepts from lecture.",
    "The exams are difficult, no doubt. But the curve is pretty friendly. If you actually take the time to put in some work then you should be fine.",
    "If you are bad at math, then you will probably struggle. If you are good at math, then you will probably not struggle. Either way, the problem sets are about 6-8 times longer than Intro Micro psets and the lectures are more complicated and dry. That being said, Samuelson is very thorough and will teach you a lot if you give him time. Overall, a good course. As someone who's not an econ major, I felt it was worthwhile.",
    "In the first weeks of the course, you end up spending a lot of time developing the mathematical concepts for modeling that you will use throughout the course. So at first, it sometimes feels like you are just learning how to set up problems and complete them and not really receiving much insight into the actual economic phenomena at play. Once those methods are in place; however, you begin to investigate more interesting insights of economics itself.",
    "I learned so much in Intermediate Econ. Not necessarily about Economics, (though there was more of that in the later in the course) but about using math and models. So I wouldn't call it fun, exactly, but it is fair, and interesting, and I'm really glad I took it. BUT. The material is difficult and I think I would've struggled a lot more if not for the quality of teaching. Samuelson is so, so good. Overall, this course isn't bad if you don't mind QR and you take it with Samuelson, and it teaches you a lot.",
    "You won't want to wake up at 9am, but you should. Professor Samuelson is really enthusiastic, and if you click with his teaching style, you'll make it to class. Psets take about 5 hours. Do every practice exam before the midterms\/finals or you will be unhappy.",
    "Only take this class if you need to or if you are very interested in the topics being covered.",
    "I would recommend ECON 121 to a student with strong mathematical background. The economic concepts are easy to understand, but sometimes the mathematical rigor and models are difficult.",
    "Difficult material, but you'll get through it if you need to.",
    "I would not recommend this class to any other students. It is the most difficult course I have taken at Yale. I had this expectation going in, but it was harder than I had even thought. The material is not interesting and extremely challenging",
    "If you want to learn Micro and can take a little heavy load (course is heavy on maths and general workload) - TAKE IT. Your hardwork will payoff. I loved this course :)",
    "Needlessly long problem sets, impossible to stay engaged in lecture, not something you take for fun.",
    "You will hate the psets. They are poorly written and don't apply to anything that you learn in class. Google is your friend. Other university's econ lectures are your friends.",
    "Take ECON 121 to fulfill your requirements for ECON. If you can take it Credit\/D for EP&E or something, I would strongly advise you to consider doing so.",
    "Econ 121 is well taught - Professor Samuelson is very clear and methodical, and the course is paced well. He also takes time to answer questions in class and is great about promptly answering questions on Piazza, which the whole class appreciated. I though that one of the midterms was unreasonably difficult, but there was a generous curve so there is no need to be extremely anxious. The material is a little dry, but that is to be expected from any intro-ish lecture course in microeconomics. It is very helpful that old exams and answer sheets are available to us so that we can practice.",
    "I would only take it if it was a requirement. The psets are long and hard. The exams are harder. And the notes don't really help too much.",
    "I mean, you probably have to take it. If you do, I would go ahead and do it with Larry.",
    "Assuming knowledge of introductory microeconomics, Econ 121 is a fairly math intensive but logical next step. The workload is not overwhelming and, with a good understanding of calculus, neither is the course.",
    "ECON121 is a necessary growing pain. It really pushed me in terms of my understanding of economics and answered a lot of questions I had about markets in a clear, mathematical manner. It required quite a bit of discipline to keep up with the material, attend lectures at 9am, and successfully complete the psets.",
    "I mean, you're only here because you have to be, so just do your best, I guess. Go to lecture. If you miss one, you will surely fall behind. Lecture was a very valuable experience: you actually will learn new, novel material. Prof Samuelson goes over a lot in class that isn't covered on the slides. He's old school and writes on the board, but this is SO much more helpful. Find a good TA. If Sumeyra is still TA'ing next time, go to her office hours! The problem sets are lengthy but manageable if you have a good study group and go to office hours. The exams are brutal. Piazza will save your life. Prof Samuelson answers questions there religiously which makes your life so much easier when you're in a large lecture and don't want to ask your question in class! I put in a lot of effort in this class (homeworks + exams) but I'm not sure I can walk out of there saying I learned much. ECON121 just is what it is.",
    "UGHHHHH!! THIS CLASS IS THE WORST! I honestly feel like I haven't learned anything. Everything - the problem sets, the exams, the lectures - are so tedious. It's not even that they're unimportant, but they're drawn out and made overly complicated. If you're an econ major, you gotta do it, and things get better after, but you should know that it's gonna be pretty frustrating.",
    "It is definitely a difficult course, but Larry taught it very well. I would recommend taking it with him if you have the chance.",
    "ECON 121 is essentially what you might expect from an intermediate economics course. It covers what you do in introductory microeconomics, but with a lot more math and a lot faster. It is a challenging course and I would only recommend it to someone who feels very comfortable with both economics concepts and with calculus and\/or needs to take the course for his\/her major.",
    "Samuelson is a really good professor. He's really excited about the material and is probably the most knowledgable professor I've had with regards to knowing the course material. That being said, the lectures are really theoretical and often move too fast for me to totally get as a Global Affairs major. The midterms were both extremely difficult, but the final was much easier. The main problem is that we learn everything theoretically and in rather vague terms in lecture, but then see these applied problems on psets and exams and it is very hard to do them. Overall, a hard but good course, but beware that the exams and psets can be very hard",
    "So long as you are comfortable with calculus, this is a great class in microeconomics! Prof Samuelson does a wonderful job of breaking down the material into understandable pieces, and helping us understand the economics behind the mathematics (which like any other math class you'll need to work through again after class). It's a 9am class, but you're in great hands if you're committed to doing this!",
    "Would never recommend. Need better structure. Only reason I am taking it is for my major.",
    "Do you want to be an econ major? If the answer is yes, you have to take this course. There is no way around it, so just do it. It gets dry at times, but you make friends working on the weekly problem sets and overall learn a couple neat tricks on the way. If you don't plan on doing further work in economics, you will not get anything out of this course you did not get in intro micro.",
    "If you are interested in economics, this class is great. Answers any questions you may have had behind the \"hand-waving\" of intro micro and gives a good view of the way that micro works.",
    "A tough class with time consuming problem sets. It is required, but the professor makes it as good as can be. If you put the time in, you can do quite well. Getting an A is quite difficult, but the A- range is extremely generous.",
    "Take it with Samuelson, and if you put in the time, you'll do well. Comfort with math (Algebra and simple multi-variable calculus) will make this course much more pleasant. But be warned, it's much more work than Intro Micro or Intro Micro. Weekly psets are graded for accuracy and generally run about 10-15 pages.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking it with Samuelson. Don't get me wrong - he's an amazing lecturer and he kills it on piazza - he cares about the students. But: 1. His psets are way too long. Brace yourself for 4 pages long of questions, all worded weirdly and confusingly. His lectures don't help with pset either. He is lenient when it comes to holidays, but once break is over, he's back with vengeance: 18 problems in one week including a humanly impossible algebraic work that leaves many students wailing in the middle of the night, wondering what and where went wrong with their calculation, or sighing at the impossible feat before their eyes. I find the pset way too stressful for me to truly enjoy the class, because after it doesn't leave me time to actually think through the problems and dig deeper into the issues, I was just happy to be done with the pset. 2. His exams are also very hard, and worded badly too. It's not really a matter of doing math but rather getting into professor Samuelson's head and understanding his way of thinking. That said, if you take it with Samuelson, you'll get to learn many new stuff. It isn't all that bad. If you do take it, just prepare for lots of work.",
    "Long psets, but from what I've heard take it with Samuelson. 9am lectures are always a bit of a struggle, especially when the slides can be difficult to understand, but Samuelson knows what he's doing.",
    "You have to take it for Econ, good luck.",
    "REALLY HARD for someone who has only taken high-school calc\/isn't good at math. LOTS OF MATH. REALLY DIFFICULT. Larry Samuelson is great though. The material is quite hard to understand, but larry is a great lecturer\/great guy.",
    "You learn so much in this class. I was a little intimidated coming in, because I'd heard that Intermediate Micro can be a stumbling block for a lot of econ majors, but I really enjoyed the class and I feel like I got a lot out of it. Larry is an amazing lecturer, and he's also very willing to engage with students and answer questions in person. Ultimately, it really helped give me a toolset for building models to address real-world economic problems. If you go to class and start the psets early, you'll do well in the class and it will definitely be worth your time.",
    "This course was so, so, so difficult. The exams and weekly problem sets are quite demanding, though at the end of the course I did have a greater understanding of microeconomic theory. All in all, after all of the late nights and tears, I did find this course to be somewhat rewarding.",
    "Only take this if you're an Econ major. Not worth the pain otherwise. Prospective EP&E majors should hold off on taking this course.",
    "would recommend, obviously need to take it for an econ major but also would recommend taking it right after intro micro because then you are continuing your understanding",
    "Challenging and rewarding class. Definitely, definitely, definitely take it with Samuelson. He knows this material like the back of his hand. Obviously this class will challenge you and force you to think in a different way, but it is definitely worth it. The curve is forgiving, and the problem sets serve as an additional lecture that provides an incremental approach to teaching you the material.",
    "You're probably taking this as a requirement, in which case make sure you take it with Larry Samuelson. He's literally the bomb dot com, and is so helpful and such a great professor. Also some of the TFs suck but if you can (and Esteban is still a TF) take Esteban's section, he's the best. It's a hard class but the curve is a blessing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a pretty decent amount of work but you learn a lot and it is organized in a nice way. The homeworks are quite long, but it's definitely better than micro theory in that regard.",
    "Would not recommend to people that have not taken at least Multi-variable calculus, as this is basically an applied math course. The psets might take a couple of hours, but are pretty leniently graded and TA's are very helpful during office hours. Larry is very good at teaching this course since he has been doing it since forever. But the 9am lecture time is brutal. Go to lecture since the ppt slides don't have graphs and he skips some steps.",
    "Econ, EP&E, and Dev Global majors, get ready. This class lives up to its reputation for being tough. Here's why: (1) Theory: In this class, you will learn about consumer choice, firms, markets, and market failure. But you will study all of these things using a basic model that maximizes a utility function subject to a constraint. Sounds easy enough, right? No. Seriously, think again. There's some ridiculous amount of econ\/math intuition needed to understand a lot of the mathematical theory that gets applied here. (2) Problem Sets: The problem sets start out friendly enough, but they can take you between 8-15 hours each week. So you need to start early (like give yourself a good 5 days), go to office hours (multiple if needed), and find a study group fast. (3) Tests: DO THE PRACTICE TESTS. This is how you study for this class. Are the tests hard? YES. But there's a sort of generous curve (about 40% A's and A-'s and 40% B's and B-'s), so you'll make it out without scathing your GPA too much. BUT...if you have a choice between taking it in the Fall with Larry or in the Spring, seriously take it in the Fall! Professor Samuelson is a GOOD TEACHER. He has been teaching this class for the last 8ish years, is very organized, has posted tons of practice tests online, and really good at explaining this stuff. It's a hard subject, no doubt, but Larry knows how to appropriately combine the use of slides and chalkboard to keep you engaged in lecture, walk you through the logic of the models step-by-step, and anticipate and answer your questions while he is lecturing. He takes the class seriously, so you will learn a lot if you do too! I would recommend taking this class with him! You can do it, you'll bond with your classmates over the struggle, and you'll come out learning a lot that's practical to your understanding of the economy today. This was my first Economics course at Yale (skipped intro with AP 5) and though it was pretty challenging, I definitely enjoyed parts of it.",
    "Only take if you must do so for the major.",
    "Take this class because you have to, not because you want to. Stay on your game, get ahead. Preview lectures. Do your homework early. Drink coffee before class. Go to the best TA sessions",
    "I appreciated how Esteban genuinely cared about the students in his section and the course material. He was always very willing to help us learn the concepts and answer questions we had. Although, sometimes I felt as Esteban's explanations were quite confusing and it was hard to grasp the main concepts.",
    "Most people take it because they have to.",
    "Professor Samuelson is an extremely effective teacher. This course is hard and takes up a lot of time, so only take it if you need to. But definitely take it with Larry if you can.",
    "Avoid like the plague unless you're an Econ major",
    "A compulsory class for Econ major and EPE",
    "It is not a fun class to take, so if it isn't a prerequisite, don't take it.",
    "you know\/have heard what youre getting into. Its all true, but its goes by fast and its not that bad",
    "Very interesting and necessary to have a strong understanding of economics.",
    "This is probably only a class that you would take if you are required to.",
    "ECON 121 is a survey course in microeconomics. It builds on the concepts from the intro course, and it introduces more complex calculus.",
    "A lot of work, but an interesting class with a professor who deeply cares about the material and is extremely knowledgeable.",
    "It's a very hard course, so I would not recommend it to anyone unless they needed it for their major.",
    "Take it, but make sure you take it with Samuelson.",
    "The course revolves around one type of maximization problem. Go to office hours for both the professor and teaching assistants to understand this problem. Once you have that down, the course gets easier.",
    "A lot more math than economics, a must-take for econ majors.",
    "Its a good course if you are interested in the quantitative side of econ.",
    "A tough class that requires a lot of effort but rewarding and worthwhile at the end",
    "Econ 121 is a very difficult course. I would suggest meeting with your Teaching Fellow or the professor as often as possible if you don't understand the material.",
    "ECON 121 is a very difficult class, though a necessity for all prospective economics majors. High school economics classes by no means prepare you for the increased complexity of ECON 121, though it certainly doesn't hurt to already have a background in economics. This course requires good quantitative reasoning skills and certainly requires effort outside of class--most of the course material is only really mastered when you complete the problem sets.",
    "This is a difficult course. The problem sets are a lot of work, but do them or you will not learn the material. It is all about getting used to standard economic concepts in a more technical setting.",
    "Much work, necessary information for Econ majors, not a necessary or pleasant course for anyone else, unless math is assumed to be a strength.",
    "!A: READ THIS IMPRESSIONS: very tough, but lovely grading (almost certain A- for me). Take in Fall over Spring just for Larry Samuelson. Youll learn less in the Spring, and suffer consequences. ENLIGHTENING COURSE: LEARNED SO MUCH and I now realize how WATERED DOWN Intro Micro is. PSETS are a ton of work, but if ur smart about them (see below) u will survive. BACKGROUND: I took BC Calc in high school, and got an A in Math 115 last Spring. havent taken multiv calc (you dont need it), and u definitely dont need linear algebra. I did very well in Intro Micro (getting an A or A- on midterms and exams), but not so great in Intro Macro (Bs or B+s on exams). The hardest part is NOT the mathits the economic intuitionknowing what to do w\/ equations. Im a glbl affairs (dev) or econ major NEED TO GO TO LECTURE?: Absolutely. Larry Samuelson writes graphs and equations on the board. Sure you can get a friends notes. But that was a last resort. I missed 4 or 5 lectures and always regretted it. CAN I GO TO WOADS AND TAKE THIS CLASS?: Its absolutely possible. Thursday 9am is ridiculously brutal though. I dont think 9am time is going to change.Try to be in bed at 1:30 by the latest. IS THIS COURSE VERY MATHY?: On the first day of class I showed up, at 9 in the morning (!), to the first meeting in Davies Auditorium. Let me tell you, the first couple of lectures are intimidating. mathematics of optimizing functions and checking first and second order conditions are just dumped on you. Looking back, maximization is straightforward. You take derivatives of different variables, and set the two or three strings equal to zero and BAM. You have your raw material to work with to solve the problem. Larry goes into a LOT of details about second order conditions. Just know the steps for how to check for them. You wont return to them at all later in the course. Know chain rule cold; algebra can be messy. LECTURE: LARRY SAMUELSON makes Fall offering worth it. Hes incredibly responsive on Piazza (I literally ask any single question about the lecture notes I have and hell answer within 24 hours. Take advantage and ask for economic interpretations of any equation. critical for your understanding). Larrys great voice is not monotonous. Spring uses his notes, but not larry himself! I cant imagine taking it without him. GO TO EVERY LECTURE PSETS: start off rough since you wont be used to them. Absolutely DONT start them Monday night. Made mistake for the first or second pset and went to bed at 3 or 4am and had to go to 9am lecture. Awful. You dont need to be like the crazies who start them immediately after they are released. But Friday afternoon not doing anything? Sunday after brunch? Buckle down and start them BY YOURSELF. If you get stuck, go STRIAGHT TO PIAZZA. If its Thursday or Friday, larry will answers your question immediately. On Monday before its due, you MUST go to office hours. MUST. Thats how I survived this course. usually are two different rooms. Dont go to yours, go to the best one (you need to shop around). Jin-Wook Chang gave me my A-. Every Monday he walks us through the psets. Wouldnt survive w\/o him. Esteban is okay, Shiva is not helpful at all. Pset #8 competitive equilibrium is brutal, didnt do it and dropped it SECTION: didnt go at the beginning. Mistake. Go to every one. Get jin-wook chang if possible. EXAMS: attempt every practice exam on the site, and review the answers multiple times. Youll see patterns in the type of problems asked. Just attempt every one (yes that takes like 12-15 hrs for each midterm and final). GRADES: the median of the class is a big wall of death. Below it, u get a B, above, u get an A-. I never did better than 3 or 4 percentage points above the median. Use ur grade from first midterm as a guide, youll stick around that percentile. Final exam was scary as I couldnt get below the median, but it worked out (got like a 79 and median was 74); Im getting an A-.Good Luck",
    "Good class. Not as hard as people say if you are comfortable with math. Make sure you go to section and TA office hours.",
    "It's a requirement, so you have no choice. Go to lecture. It helps.",
    "If you like Econ and are remotely good at math, TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Definitely a challenging class, but I enjoyed it. Prof Samuelson is a great lecturer",
    "Professor Samuelson is a great teacher and explains the material well, but the problems sets are still incredibly challenging. I would not recommend this class to non-Econ majors",
    "It's an okay class. The math is just calculus but sometimes annoying. Every now and then you'll solve a problem and reach a fun conclusion but not very often.",
    "I would not recommend taking the class unless you need it in order to fulfill a requirement. It is very time consuming and difficult.",
    "It a good course. Only take it when required though.",
    "Hard but a good class if you are an Econ major",
    "I took it Cr\/D...just had to stay out of bottom 5%. Not too hard to do, let's just say...",
    "I know this class is taken only by Econ and EP&E majors. EP&E, save yourselves a headache and take it Credit\/D. Econ majors, this class is actually interesting and you will recognize what you do in it in your other classes. You should know going in, however, how to do partial derivatives\/multivariable and integrals, or you'll have trouble until you remember\/figure it out. Professor Samuelson is great, but only if you're ready to listen at 9am.",
    "I would not recommend ECON 121 01 to other students because it was a very difficult, rarely interesting course. This course is required because it teaches us how to deal with intermediate-level problems, not because it is fun. I would not take this course unless I was seriously interested in becoming an Econ major.",
    "An in-depth\/mathematical exploration of the concepts we learned about in intro micro.",
    "Take this class if you have to. It'll require some effort and all of your attention, so don't expect to have an easy time in this class if you don't pay it the attention it deserves. This said, some of the concepts presented in this class are phenomenally satisfying! The economics is rather insightful and frankly cool!",
    "Intermediate micro is going to be a killer class no matter what. It's just a lot of complicated concepts that combine economics and multivariable calculus. The workload is a lot, with the pset being the longest I have done (and I've taken Orgo 1 and 2). Samuelson does a pretty good job of explaining concepts, but it is still difficult to grasp topics because there is no official textbook and the slides are not comprehensive and skip over steps. The best advice I would give is to definitely attend every lecture and try your darn hardest to stay awake and focus for all of them. Section is also very helpful for answering questions. This is not a class you can afford to get behind in. Being good at calculus will really help you out.",
    "As per its reputation, 121 is a somewhat difficult course simply because there's so much material and you need to be able to creatively manipulate it in ways not completely covered in class. This requires a lot of time outside of class, but if you're not an econ major and feel somewhat comfortable with econ, I would strongly recommend this class - you end up learning a lot of extremely interesting material, even if you might not need it in the future. The course is very well organized, and Larry is an excellent and cheerful instructor. Most people, however, take it for their major. Psets took me roughly 6 hours a week and were difficult, but manageable. Strongly recommend doing ALL of the practice tests before midterms\/finals, so plan ahead accordingly!",
    "The class really isn't too bad although it's frustrating that if you mess up a little in the midterms you're almost forever banned only into the A- range or lower. It's really hard to actually get a straight A. All the past midterms and exams are put available for practice but quite frankly I'm not too sure they help too much if you don't understand the material properly because Prof Samuelson never reconstructs a similar question. Going to lecture really is quite important although the problem sets really help you learn the material. The TA's were extremely helpful to polish off the psets.",
    "Only take it for the Major. It's rough",
    "I would not recommend this to another student unless it is absolutely required of you."
