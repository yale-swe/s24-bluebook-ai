   "comments": [
    "Good class. I think we spent too much time on abstract algebra at the very beginning of the class. Problem sets ranged from 1 or 2 pretty easy ones that only took like 4 hours to really hard ones that took 10+ hours. Midterm wasn't hard, but the final probably will be. Material was easier than 120, but if this is your first proof-based class you really have to keep up and be very meticulous in learning how to do a good proof.",
    "MATH 225 is a very hard course. If you are interested in Linear Algebra, carefully consider taking 222 instead as it is much much easier. Know that MATH 225 expects a background in proving, and that background is difficult to make up during the course.",
    "I would summarize this as a bad class that is excruciatingly boring and hard. Tough to get an A as theres no curve",
    "Math 225 is a good introduction to proof-based Math. The problem sets take forever, but they can be rewarding if you work on them. If you take the class, you have to be able to teach yourself a lot and put in the time on your own, because if you take it with Algom-Kfir, it willnot be spectacularly taught.",
    "Math 225 is a theory-based approach to linear algebra. You will also be exposed to basic concepts of abstract algebra. While computational skill is important, it is not the focus of the course or the problem sets. Exams,particularly the final, are difficult but fair, and reflect the subjects covered in class. This course is highly recommended for those interested in progressing to more advanced proof-based courses. The course is demanding. Problem sets are long and difficult, but informative and well constructed.",
    "A proof-based math class with weekly problem sets, Math 225 wasn't as hard as the reviews said it would be. If you're interested in proof-based math, try shopping it; if you're looking for applications of linear algebra, though, 222 might be better for you -- we did some applications, but spent most of our time on proofs.",
    "It is Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory, and the name of the course gives everything; it is a theory class, with not a lot of focus on application. You get to learn how all the theorems, formulas and lemmas come about; and it is great how everything fits together logically. There were couple of moments that I felt amazed by the beauty of mathematics. On the other hand, it is a lot of workload (I remember submitting about 30-page pset almost every week, which took about 10 hours to write out). But working with other friends was very enjoyable, and I would love to take a class like this in the future. It is definitely worth it.",
    "A good introduction to proof-based math. Take it with Yael, who is an excellent teacher. Expect to be challenged with some of the problem sets, but none of them were too time consuming. You do not cover as much linear algebra as 222, but you do it in a more enjoyable way (not just computation).",
    "I would recommend math 225 only to people who are very good in math or they can spend about 10 hours per week studying individually. In the same time, it is good opportunity how math department works.",
    "The material was good. I didn't understand a lot of what was going on in class at times as the proofs move quickly and notation is hard to follow, but studying it at the end of the year using the textbook helped clear up a lot of confusion. Overall, you learn linear algebra well, and I would recommend it.",
    "Cover a lot more topics in 225 than 222, difficult topics.",
    "The course material for this class (as opposed with the material for 222) is incredible and extremely interesting. I would never hesitate to recommend the course to anyone. It consisted of many proofs, and a difficulty much higher than anything calculus students will likely have had. But it's great. My only reservation is with the circumstance of the teaching this semester: Unfortunately, Prof. Kfir had some outside engagements that really prevented her from devoting the right amount of time to the course, and so I felt that the teaching was not where it could have been. But I'm not making any kind of judgement about Prof. Kfir's teaching. I am thinking that if she ever teaches this course again, she would probably be much more prepared and would be able to devote more time to it. All in all, I loved the course."
