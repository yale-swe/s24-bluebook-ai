    "Take it if you need to",
    "Microbio is a really fascinating course, the material you study is really interesting and relevant to your education, regardless of your background\/future career I think. However, Professor Wertz manages to partially ruin the course because he is the worst teacher I have ever had -- and I've had plenty of terrible teachers before him. Also you don't get to see how terrible he is during shopping period because he teaches the 2nd half of the course (the most interesting material wise, good thing otherwise I would have just stopped going to lecture). Professor Jacobs-Wagner teaches the first half and she's truly incredible. Her lectures are fast-paced, clear, detailed and she just rocks. There are 2 midterms and a final-- the exams are definitely hard, but not having section is really great. The TFs are *amazing* and super helpful if you need any sort of help.",
    "Standard microbiology course. Jacobs-Wagner is a great teacher but Wertz's lectures are pretty boring. Tests are pretty hard (especially Wertz's exam which asked super specific details).",
    "Overall I would recommend the class. I've learned a lot from it and I think having a foundation in microbiology is really useful for biologists\/doctors. It was 2 midterms and a final so not too much work, but the exams do test details (but not ridiculously small ones).",
    "Don't do it.",
    "The first half of this course (with Prof Jacobs-Wagner) was SO GOOD. It was so engaging and exciting that microbio quickly became one of my favorite courses at Yale. However, once Prof Wertz began teaching, it quickly became one of my least favorite courses at Yale. He's just not good at getting information across... and this was reflected in our midterm grades. I wish Prof Jacobs-Wagner could just teach the whole course because she's such an exceptional lecturer. The tests were ok but were much better when the class was better-taught. I wouldn't take this again if I knew about how the course tanks during the second half, but if you're like me, you probably had to take this for your major.",
    "Some great lectures that give you a solid foundation in bacterial biology and infectious disease. Your entire grade is based on two midterms and one final (no psets), which I found to be nice but could also be stressful.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS! It's so good. I don't know how the grading works but the midterms were reasonable and there is no reading, no section, no homework. Its perfect.",
    "This is an exam-based course. You don't need the textbook. You'll learn so much about prokaryotes you forget what the hell a nucleus is. Definitely bacteria focused, only two lectures on viruses and barely anything on archaea.",
    "This class is very difficult. You learn a lot of great material. If you want to learn about bacteria and viruses, go for it. But we warned that this class is NOT A GUT, and is definitely HARD. YOU MUST PUT IN THE TIME TO STUDY. I'm talking about hours a day. When it comes to midterm or final exam time, start studying a week or two in advance. The exams will cover anything. Everything is fair game, even information that was presented on only one slide. You must know the lecture slides inside and out and pay attention to the professors during lecture. Take lots of notes on slides, and try to find ways to explain the material to yourself. GO TO REVIEW SESSIONS! SEE THE TAs! If you are an MCDB major and\/or someone who is willing to dedicate half their homework time to this class, then take it. But please, do not take it if you don't think you are able to put in the time for this class.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It was the worst class of my life and the lack of support made me feel like I was isolated on an island. I sought out a tutor for the class after the first midterm and by then it was too late. I just felt helpless the entire semester and so confused on all the material. This class made my junior year incredibly stressful.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in microbiology, which is extremely prominent in our day-to-day lives and ties in many interesting aspects of Biochemistry, Genetics, and Cell Biology.",
    "The course only consists of lectures and exams, so the workload is not bad. It covers a lot of material though so you definitely have to try hard on the tests. Super cool topics, very interesting.",
    "I would recommend the lecture if Wertz isn't teaching the second half. However, I would also recommend taking the lecture without the lab.",
    "Microbiology is a great balanced course in the MCDB core electives. You definitely learn a lot about all the diverse uses and functions of microbes as well as gain a greater understanding of diseases. The workload is not too heavy and the TAs and professors are all very well versed in the subject areas and do a great job of being accessible and clear. The exams are fair, but sometimes nitpicky, and as long as you attend review sessions and review the material on a regular basis you should be fine.",
    "Very interesting material and made have a better understanding of biology. However a lot of the information was too detail oriented",
    "A decent course. Low commitment, just two midterms and a final, and not necessarily overwhelming. However, I will say that the course starts out a lot better than it ends. Prof Jacobs-Wagner is really great and engaging, and her exam questions are actually quite thought-provoking. Prof Wertz, however, is rather dry and his exams were not at all fair. Take it if you want a bio class with decently interesting material that isn't too much work, but don't expect to fall in love with it.",
    "This class was interesting and covered a lot of material. There were no assessments other than the midterms and final so being a good test taker was crucial for your success in this course.",
    "I would recommend microbiology. The class is very interacting. Bacteria are fascinating to learn about. The tests are fair for the most part. Jacobs-Wagner and Wertz are great and the TAs were helpful. I think this one of the best MCDB courses.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to or you love microbiology.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this class--it was more dry than I expected. I took it excited to learn but halfway through the semester I just got bogged down on the material--it was no longer interesting. Few clinical aspects are discussed, the material seemed to only skim the surface, and a lot of topics were covered but with no depth. The teaching could also be better. This was a course I've looked forward to taking for awhile but unfortunately, I did not like it as much as I thought I would.",
    "Would definitely recommend- good course, interesting material and as long as you put in the effort you can do well- just don't go in thinking you'll get an easy A because if you do not work in this class you will not do well. I know someone who got a 3 on the midterm...",
    "I loved microbiology. It was incredibly interesting and Christine Jacobs-Wagner lectured phenomenally. The second half of the course with Wertz was less well taught, but the material remained very interesting.",
    "Take it!",
    "I have a serious problem with the way MCDB courses like this are structured. With two lecturers, dare I say \"professors\" and a guest lecturer, course material was random, scattered, and not comprehensive. JW focused more on concepts and experiment designing. Wertz asked us about very detailed things we HADN'T SPECIFICALLY COVERED IN CLASS: the students that did better in this environment were those that had taken previous cell bio or biochemistry courses and had background knowledge that would allow them to answer the questions correctly. I found it very frustrating that no matter how I reviewed the mechanisms and lecture slides, I couldn't be as prepared as the students who were living and breathing biochemistry and laboratory experiments. I also thought that the information covered just wasn't \"Micro 101\" material. For example, we never learned the fact that a bacterium's chromosome is actually CIRCULAR, which I had to learn through wikipedia in order to understand some of the lecture slides. It seemed that basic bacterial knowledge was not ever covered, and the class only focused on ridiculous things like peptidoglycan synthesis and flagellar assembly, which don't seem as NECESSARY as basic cellular mechanisms like DNA replication and protein assembly, which are fundamentally different processes. I was even more frustrated with the final exam, as I believe that the 18 questions didn't accurately cover or represent the scope of the course material. I delved way back into cellular processes, signaling mechanisms, flagellar assembly, and more, only to be asked questions like \"explain lactic acid synthesis in relation to the electron transport chain\" and \"tell us what DNA replication techniques are useful for.\" Did we ever learn applications to microbiology? Certainly not.",
    "I would recommend the course if you're willing to put the studying time in. I think that all Pre-Med, Pre-Nursing, and Pre-Vet students should be required to take the course.",
    "A very interesting class, but do not even think about missing a single lecture, it'll come back to haunt you. The material is pretty interesting (especially when you get to diseases), but both the professors love to add additional information (that will be tested) that is nowhere on the slides. Definitely go to office hours for the TA's at least once every two weeks, it's a game changer for keeping up with the material.",
    "This is an amazing class everyone should take just to learn more about the world! If taken for a grade though, it can be overwhelming if you do not stay on top of the lectures.",
    "Keep on top of the material and you'll be fine. Go to TA office hours to get anything cleared up.",
    "This was a really great biology course. I learned a lot. The professors liked the topics they were teaching and had a great knowledge of it that they could get across to students. The only grades in this class are exams, which sounds stressful, but you just have to really study the lectures to do well. If you are interested in microbiology, definitely take this course. It was really nice not having to do busy work. Studying for the exams was time consuming, but if you study right you will actually remember the information. I learned a lot of really cool things in this class, like why swiss cheese has holes and how you die from tetanus!",
    "MCDB 290 was difficult, but by far my favorite class at Yale so far. I have no idea where my grade will be because they don't give ANY sort of indication AT ALL. There was an 80 point range in scores for both midterms (18-98 and 16-96). The material is so interesting I really enjoyed studying for the exams and the TAs were phenomenal this semester. There is a whole section on infectious disease which was extremely interesting and I walked away understanding a lot more about bacteria and viruses and the diseases they cause. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this course. Take it credit\/D\/fail if you can though because the grade is 100% exams (two midterms and a final), so no homework, quizzes, section, etc.",
    "This is a great course to expose you to all corners of microbiology. Lectures are decent without being electrifying. Listening to Professor Wertz is not unlike watching paint dry, but at least the paint in this case is pretty cool and worth trying to stay awake to look at. Workload is pretty much zero, except that it's not because when the exam rolls around you realize there's a huge amount of material you should have been studying throughout the semester and you didn't because nothing was due. So I'm rating workload as less despite a couple very late nights.",
    "I think the course material was interesting but I probably would not have taken the course if I wasn't interested infectious disease.",
    "It's a pretty good MCDB course, but the grading is screwy.",
    "This class is a very great introduction to the broad field of microbiology, which is one of the most fascinating fields of biology. Its importance is easily seen through the course as its applications matters to such an extent to everyday life. I would highly recommend this course to any MCDB major since it is not very difficult and you learn so much out of this course.",
    "take it as a core. not a huge workload and you learn a lot."
