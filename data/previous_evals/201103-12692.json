    "It depends on your professor. A good, solid, straightforward class if you don't have Matt Schullman. If you have Matt Schullman, then you deal with material that's more complex and ambiguous.",
    "This is a good intro to music theory class. After this class, you should be able to analyze a classical piece of music, do Roman Numeral analysis, functional analysis, and be able to recognize basic structures and patterns in a piece of music. I think every musician should take this class in order to gain a basic understanding of music theory. If Matthew Schullman is teaching it, take it with him because he puts SO much effort into trying to help you understand all the material and helping you improve on your weaknesses. He is also a really approachable person who you can find in Blue State (Wall St) every morning.",
    "I would recommend this course if you've been exposed to some music theory in private lessons or an intro course and you're interested in an in-depth intermediate level music theory course. I would not recommend this course as a \"gut\" class. The homework assignments can take a long time.",
    "Your experience with this class really depends on what sectionyou choose to be in. I had friends in another section who didn't have as many frustrations or problems with the course.",
    "Pretty good, learned a ton of things. Taking it with Matt Schullman was particularly good in that you learned a ton of material - however, he was not nice to your grade about it.",
    "Please take this class with ANY T.A. other than Matthew Schullman (he was awful, gave ridiculous amounts of hw, and graded harshly)."
