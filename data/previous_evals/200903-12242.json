    "We studied very esoteric material, so you'll either hate or you'll love it and you'll probably know after a couple days of shopping it. If you are interested in spirituality, God and\/or the history of absurd things, this class is for you.",
    "Not a must-take course, but not bad.",
    "Take it if you are interested in historical issues in religious thought.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS EVER. YOU MUST TAKE IT. Carlos Eire is amazing, and mystics are so weird that you will never be bored. Two hour-long exams, 1 ten-page paper, and a couple of reading responses - easy and soooo fascinating with an awesome prof!",
    "Whether you're a religious studies or history major, or if you are just looking for a class to explore in a different major, I very much recommend this class.",
    "A mixture of historical, philosophical, and social interpretations of Christian Mysticism. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject or who would like to know more about Christian Mystics.",
    "You read a lot of classics in the Christian mystical tradition and set them in their context. These can get a little samey, especially if you're not that interested in mysticism to begin with, but I found them really interesting. Professor Eire's lectures are great."
