   "comments": [
    "Take it credit\/d as a 5th class. little work, you still get something out of it and it makes you think.",
    "take credit\/D",
    "Absolutely take this course. It was fascinating, and you'll learn a lot, especially if this is your first philosophy course. I do recommend taking the class credit\/d\/fail--it really is difficult to do well otherwise--but absolutely take it if you have room for one more credit\/d. Shelly is a phenomenal lecturer, and you'll be excited every day to go to class.",
    "Makes you think about issues in ways you may have never thought of before. Definitely an interesting class, and I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Death to a fellow student, as long as their interesting in the incredibly interesting material. Shelly is a great professor and the topics we covered were really interesting and relevant to me. Granted I took the class Credit\/D, it was basically no work and so I felt I could get out of it exactly what I wanted. If you're looking for an easy A definitely stay away because he's a notoriously harsh grader, but if you're looking to explore the difficult subject of Death and have someone push you and challenge your beliefs this a definitely a course you should take.",
    "Incredible course to just ponder about. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Take it Credit\/D to start, but it honestly isn't that bad in terms of grading. I would recommend actually googling \"how to write a philosophy paper,\" because the document he gives isn't really that informative. Also, if you have a broad philosophy background, a lot of the beginning material can be rather dull, but overall, a wonderful course. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a great class - you should take it. It's not as good as Shelly's Introduction to Ethics class, but it is still really interesting. Shelly's classes are all about teaching you to think rather than teaching you about what others have thought, and this class does exactly that. Discussion sections are great. If you consider all the angles of an issue and back up your points clearly on your essays, the grading will be fair.",
    "This class was more about Shelly Kagan's personal opinions on matters related to, and surrounding, the idea\/reality of death and what exists\/does not exist after it, as opposed to a broad and fair philosophical understanding of the topic. While it is really impressive to see him philosophize right before your eyes, without any notes\/lecture slides, you will only like (can't think of a better word) what he is saying if you personally agree with it.",
    "Death is a great intro philosophy course, particularly for non-philosophy majors. While majors may find it interesting, it can definitely leave you a bit unsatisfied and hoping for more. Shelly is a great lecturer and an incredible philosophers. Anyone at Yale should at least take one class with him before graduating",
    "You consider what death is and how you should live your life knowing it will happen. I recommend this course.",
    "Take it credit d. It'll be much less stressful and you'll still learn a lot and get to think about cool stuff",
    "This is a very interesting class with material I think everyone should think about at some point. It's true, the grading is tougher than usual, but I think some people exaggerate that as well. It is true that you could just watch the lectures on open courseware, but there is something special about watching Prof Kagan live and asking questions on the spot. There isn't a lot of work except for the 3 essays and mandatory section attendance. The readings are hardly discussed and never assessed.",
    "Death is a great course. If you are going to take one of Life or Death, choose Life, but this is also very good. People don't think about death enough, especially because it is something that will happen to everyone. This course will let you explore a number of philosophical issues related to death. I was worried that the course would be quite grim, but Shelly's attitude made for a fun course.",
    "Thought-provoking and not too heavy literature (which was completely unnecessary for getting a good grade but still worth reading), mostly interesting lecture, section was run well. Lecture could get dull at times when the professor spent too much time explaining things that felt like common sense. The material is really cool and though I don't think the class changed my mind about anything big, it gave me a framework of how to think like a philosopher and take down \/ build up arguments.",
    "The following is what Prof. Kagan will probably say during the first class: The very first thing Id like to do is invite you to call me Shelly. If you take this class, you will probably get a pretty good idea of what philosophers do. Id like to encourage you to ask questions. Youre not going to get any answers from me. Unlike most philosophy classes, in this one, I will try to convince you of my set of beliefs. Id also add that many students experience this course on a personal level. Be prepared to have your beliefs challenged and maybe changed."
