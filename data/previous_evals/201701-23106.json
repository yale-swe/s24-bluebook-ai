    "My dancing improved a lot and I have a newfound appreciation for both African dance and the culture.",
    "You'll learn about five dances that you perform every single class. Also, you're randomly paired with a group to create a group piece. Doesn't matter how long. You work on it during after every class towards the end of the semester. You'll have one midterm paper , and you'll have a final paper .",
    "This is one of my favorite classes at Yale. Unlike most stressful courses, this class was the biggest reason my mental health improved over the course of the semester. I loved taking 4 hours of my day being one with my body, taking part in meditative stretches, learning fascinating new dances, getting drenched from the effort, working in groups to create creative projects, and learning so much about west african dance. Being a serious dancer in high school. I was so happy to reconnect to my roots and grow so many more beaches. If you are a dancer or non-dancer take this class!",
    "Appreciation and understanding of some West African dance forms, and how to manipulate rhythm and form to create choreography and improvisation.",
    "Learned how to dance better and work well with others",
    "I've learned to engage with different types of dance and other ways to learn.",
    "West African dance taught me a lot about how to use my body in a more natural way in dance",
    "I got to dance for three hours a week and engage in kinesthetic investigation."

   "comments": [
    "The course takes up a lot of class time but it is great exercise and a lot of fun.",
    "This class is very fun, you physically get to move around which is awesome. But you don't know how you are doing",
    "Strength: no homework, you don't really have to do the readings Weaknesses: same dances every single class. The midterm and final paper assignments are ridiculous. The class is two hours TWICE a week. Beware. You'll be tired of it by your fourth week.",
    "I think the class should stay the way it is.",
    "I found the discussion sections to be most helpful when we were able to get a conversation going as a group, or when Lacina answered our questions. The dancing parts of class were definitely preferred.",
    "It got a little repetitive towards the end. It would be nice to learn more dances and do skills practices so that each class sessiok isn't always the same. Also, class would run late often on Thursdays. That made it hard to get to next classes on time.",
    "The time commitment is high. Although, you are dancing majority of the time so it's a nice break from other classes. The visiting professor was great!",
    "This class is an opportunity to learn west african dance, to be physically active for several hours a week, to break out of your academic comfort zone and dance! It is not an academic engagement with the meaning of dance in Africa of society.",
    "The seminar\/academic portion of the class could stand to become either more or less rigorous. As it is it's an awkward in between, where no one does any reading or is expected to have any real intellectual contribution yet there is still a painful amount of time (1 hr\/week) devoted to discussion as well as inordinately long paper assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend. Low workload and a lot of fun. Professor is great.",
    "No. Don't take it unless you want to dance the same routines three to four hours a week.",
    "Lacina is a great professor and the class is incredibly fun. You will be hard pressed to find another course at this school that is remotely like this one so i would highly recommend taking this one while you can.",
    "This is one of my favorite classes at Yale. Unlike most stressful courses, this class was the biggest reason my mental health improved over the course of the semester. I loved taking 4 hours of my day being one with my body, taking part in meditative stretches, learning fascinating new dances, getting drenched from the effort, working in groups to create creative projects, and learning so much about west african dance. Being a serious dancer in high school. I was so happy to reconnect to my roots and grow so many more beaches. If you are a dancer or non-dancer take this class!",
    "This class is great - Lacina is incredible and so invested, plus a beautiful mover - you really should take class with him. It's a lot of _fun_, how often do you have fun in a Yale class? It's so enjoyable that the fact you also are learning sneaks up on you. It's not an arduous learning process, though physically strenuous at times. I loved being in class.",
    "Yes! Take this course! It's so fun and it is accessible to everyone (not just people who are in dance groups)",
    "Fun and easy class. The novelty of getting to dance instead of do more traditional work wears off though. Also, the dancing can get very physically tiring (especially after a lively Wednesday evening). Given how little outside of the classroom work there is to do, if recommend it as a 5th class",
    "Yes! It was a great class that allowed us to enter at whatever starting point where were began.",
    "If you want to dance, and really seriously dance, definitely take this course!!! Lacina is a really really wonderful dance teacher. If you want to learn about african dance theoretically, this is probably not the course for you.",
    "100% take it, you just dance all class its great for Cr\/D. Watch out for the amount of class time though, its 4 hours a week which is more than you realize.",
    "If you're looking to dance and perfect a collection of dances, I would highly recommend it!",
    "This is a dance class. You will come in and learn west african dance forms, how to follow rhythms and be in tune with your body. You won't learn much about west africa or the role of dance in contemporary west african society. But it is a great way to break free of academic comfort zone and dance!"
