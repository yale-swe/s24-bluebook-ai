   "comments": [
    "It's a perfect introduction to US academic writing style. If you were interested in learning that, i would take it. The professor is really helpful. If your main goal was to learn about globalization, you would probably not appreciate the course too much - because, again, it's more about writing.",
    "It was a lot of heavy reading, twenty-forty page articles every night and a lot of busy work. The busy work was frustrating at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend 114 to another student. It's a very well taught class with an intriguing subject matter and a great professor. The atmosphere is intimate and is more like a discussion than an actual classroom.",
    "The class required a lot of reading. Admittedly, at times it was tedious, but the content was extremely interesting, and I recommend this class because it definitely gets you thinking about the world as something larger than yourself, and the course is extremely helpful in learning how to structure academic research essays (as it is supposed to do).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. However, this is more of a course one takes with the objective-better writing skills-in mind than as something you will enjoy.",
    "English 114 is a great class for students who would like to improve their writing and are interested in global issues. Don't get me wrong; it's not an easy class, but it is certainly rewarding. The majority of the readings focused on foreign aid, but other topics were briefly discussed as well.",
    "Fantastic course with a reasonable workload. Do the readings and meet with Professor Gosselink (she is very helpful out of class) and your writing will improve lots.",
    "I would say that English 114 12 is a basic writing seminar focused on analysis of essays pertaining to a specific topic and responses to those essays and research on the same overall topic. The class can be very helpful for students who are unsure of the strength of their writing and want to start in a class that is designed to help students like themselves. The class gives writers like me a lot of confidence. I would especially recommend the class to someone who is interested in international affairs, economics, politics, or subjects such as those."
