    "While this class is a physics elective, it is not the most enjoyable or useful class. It is not incredibly well taught, and ended up being a lot more work than it seemed at first.",
    "This class was more work that I anticipated. But I think I got more out of doing the problems on the problem set than out of the lecture, so maybe it was worth it. This class also is only tangentially related to astronomy. Many of the problems are on astronomy datasets, but it's not really important to understand any concepts of astronomy. Some basic familiarity with terms that are the column names in the data sets (e.g. radio flux density, redshift) would help, but is not necessary--I didn't know anything about those things, and for the most part it didn't matter. There were weekly labs where you could try out coding with some of the concepts, and ask questions of instructors, but they were not as difficult as the homework for the most part.",
    "A very broad introduction to statistical methods used throughout science, primarily implemented with the Python programming language. It would be highly advised to have taken a statistics class in the past - the professor focuses on the implementation of many different statistical analysis tools through code, not on the derivation or the proof of how they work. The problem sets for this course are quite difficult, as is the final project. This class is a lot of work, especially if you do not have strong exposure to programming, statistics, and astronomy. Be sure to ask the TF many questions, as these statistical methods are often very complicated. Also, if you are not familiar with Python, be wary of taking this course - all of the problem sets are strongly Python based, and can become very very long.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in getting a thorough introduction to practical statistics. That is, not just learning definitions of terms and solving toy problems on paper but taking actual real world problems and extracting meaning from them. The \"astro\" aspect of this class is largely decorative. There is no need to be proficient in Astronomy, or even be interested in it in order to take the class so don't let that deter you. It is hard work but the rewards are rich and you will continue reaping them way beyond class. The code I wrote for my homework problems is helping me do research\/build stuff for my startup. Prof is very chill and final projects ran the range from NBA stats analysis to predicting fraud in healthcare services.",
    "I learned a lot from this class about Python, statistics and data mining. Don't expect to learn much about astronomy. I was exposed to many of the topics important in these fields, but had to learn about their theory on my own. Overall, however, I cannot recommend this class until the teaching and project requirements become clearer."
