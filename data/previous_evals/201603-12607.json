    "An understanding of the equations that govern the dynamics of our atmosphere. Mostly gained a better mathematical understanding of concepts I already understood qualitatively, but gained some qualitative understanding of weather and climate as well",

   "comments": [
    "I think this course is great for people wishing to more quantitatively understand the atmosphere. However, there is plenty of math and not all of it seems useful or applicable. At the end of the course I was left still wondering at many facets of weather and climate. But, to be fair, you learn an incredible amount in the time given and the material is interesting everyday.",
    "This course was very quantitative and math-based, with very few of the hand-wavy descriptions that in my opinion are very helpful for understanding and being able to reason about science. It's both a strength and a weakness in this class, depending on how you learn. The physics students in the class enjoyed the quantitative stuff, the G&G students mostly enjoyed the more qualitative phenomenological stuff",
    "I loved the map discussions, balloon soundings, animations, and demonstrations that supplemented the lecture. It was a great mix that kept it engaging and made it more clear."

   "comments": [
    "Yes--great class if you want to learn about the weather and earth physics",
    "I would recommend this to students interested in how the climate dynamically works, but only in basic function. It's an incredible amount of material covered in one semester and often the PSETs are very frustrating or difficult. But if you put in the work you'll get a good result.",
    "For anyone with an interest in weather and climate and\/or a strong background in math and physics, this is a good course to take. Probably one of the most heavily quantitative courses in the G&G department. It says you should have taken Diff eq, I hadn't and it might've helped a few times but mostly just with understanding the derivation of a few equations.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was really interesting and now I feel like I have a confident and quantitative grasp on why our climate behaves the way it does."
