    "Great course. The seminar makes it much easier to learn the material. It's not really a seminar because Katerina pretty much lectures the whole time, but the small class size means you can ask as many questions as you want which is a lifesaver for understanding the material! Also Friday problem solving sessions were amazing\u2013 real applications of the themes we learned in class. And take it with Katerina... she's sassy and a great teacher.",
    "Professor Simons was really great. The midterms aren't too bad as long as you understand the problem sets.",
    "Amazing introduction to Economics!",
    "I took the seminar because I thought it would make me learn the foundations of economics properly. It doesn't. Take the lecture because it is less intensive and you have more people to discuss the content with.",
    "Yea",
    "ECON 108 is a small, introductory microeconomics course that moves very slowly in the beginning but then quickly accelerates and gets more difficult in the middle of the semester (i.e. after the first midterm). It feels like a superficial knowledge since often we were just setting things equal to each other without much of a rigorous theorem or idea behind it, but there more moments of deeper learning. I would recommend it simply because Econ is required for so many other courses, but I would say that it is not particularly interesting."
