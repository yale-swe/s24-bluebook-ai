    "A good, fun way to learn some Hebrew and get 1.5 credits. The nightly work may occasionally get a bit annoying, but generally, it was worth it.",
    "If you took L1 Hebrew you don't have much of a choice in taking this. Be warned, it's significantly more work than L1 with Ayala, and you should plan your schedule accordingly.",
    "yes i would recommend it if you want to learn hebrew a lot.",
    "Pretty classic l2 hebrew, move quickly but learn a lot",
    "Keep up with the homework, do your yomans on time, and study for the quizzes and you will be more than fine. It gets hard to keep up with work towards the end of the semester but do your best anyway.",
    "An amazing class! Hebrew is a really easy language to learn, and Shiri makes it super fun. This is the perfect way to fulfill your language credit, and it's relevant to almost everyone, since a little Hebrew goes a long way in Israel, and besides tourism and religious importance, Israel is a great place for research and internships (and Yale has fantastic resources for both). TL;DR: Fun, easy, useful language credit."
