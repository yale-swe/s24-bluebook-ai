   "comments": [
    "I was unsure that we would be designing buildings after hearing the studio introduction. I was concerned that the studio would remain very theoretical and that I would not get to architecture. Therefore, I was relieved to have been able to design a building in this class that was in support of our conceptual statement. Overall, the class was under rated by the students in the lottery process, but the outcome of the studio blew everyone away.",
    "My expectations were both high and low. High because it was my last semester, and low because I really didn\u0092t know when I was assigned to the studio what it was about. After a few weeks of analysis, which was further discouraging, I soon realized both how amazing Emmanuel was and what he actually was intended for the semester.",
    "I anticipated that this studio would be unique in its involvement with a sociological text. I was eager to investigate a unique architecture for a changing modern condition and my expectations were exceeded almost across the board.",
    "I did not have any specific expectations of this studio. The extended process of analytical drawings and models that we did up until midterm could not have been predicted from the studio brief. That said, the pre-midterm analysis work was incredibly useful and productive. E.P. demanded a lot from us, which was stressful at times, but also very rewarding in the end.The end of the studio came a little too quickly, perhaps because we didn't really design any buildings until after midterms. I wish we would have had more time to fully-resolve our buildings architecturally. But I guess this would have left us with not enough time to develop the intellectual content, which I think is more important.",
    "I expected a theoretically heavy studio process with a lot of physical modeling. I was right.Reflecting the comments of our juries, I am proud of the amount and quality of work produced by the entire studio. There should be more advanced studios like this one that questions the usual architectural and representational processes and less \"advanced\" studios focused on producing CD sets for single family houses or regurgitating Indian architecture.",
    "My expectations were for a highly conceptual project, while this was met, I found the studio to be far more useful than i expected in terms of its architectural and spatial ideas. Our conceptual studies were directly tied to unique spatial situations in a way that most conceptual work fails to achieve and ultimately led to what I felt was an extremely rich project.",
    "My expectations that the studio would have a strong theoretical underpinning and the manner in which studio was held was met. I think it would have helped to have a second voice in the desk crits and possibly with an assistant the studio would not be a mandatory partners studio, which I feel is important for a third year studio. Much more attention was given to the craftsmanship and aesthetics of each model or drawing than I had expected. This seemed at times to be somewhat superficial, but I realize it was somewhat the approach of the studio and respected it."

   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. - adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Laser cutters are extremely popular and new investments in additional large 'industrial' cutters should be a priority.",
    "Because we were working in pairs, the server space was very important for file sharing. We often ran out of space. It would be great to allocate more server space for the partner studios that need to work that way. Our studio was on the 7th floor and I found that the computers on that floor were slower and had less memory than the ones on the 4th floor. Also, we were required to build many very large models and we did not have adequate storage space. By the end of the semester I was unable to even work at my desk because it was being used as storage. It would be nice to be able to take out more than one book from the library at a time. The sign-up sheet for the laser cutters was often overbooked but then people would not show up to the time they signed up for. Maybe because there are more students in the building this year, but it seemed to be that people would just sign up for time for the sake of having it. It made the whole process very stressful.",
    "Resources were available, and Emmanuel was always around. His genuine interest and care for each project is something I had not yet seen in my entire tenure at Yale. He was around because he was interested and not because it was his duty.",
    "Yes, the resources were adequate",
    "(1) The disk space on the class server was nowhere near adequate for what we were doing.(2) The space in studio that we have was nowhere near adequate for the size and quantity of models we were making.(3) Especially near the end of the semester, the fabrication lab was too crowded and messy and chaotic for us to have the right conditions to work on our models down there.",
    "Yes but we need more room to store the many models we made.",
    "yes, everything was well available. the biggest problem is the price of materials at Hull's, I can't understand why the school lets the students get ripped off instead of opening a store with the supplies we really need - Sci-Arc is an example of a school with a very strong store which is integral to the model making process.",
    "Yes."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "The methods of the course were extremely useful in the production of work. I have no suggestions for changing course.",
    "My biggest issue with the class was the other students. I donot believe that first year post pro students should be in advanced studios. They do not have the work ethic of the M.Arch I students. They often felt entitled over other students and would forget that the work environment should be one of positive reinforcement. Half of my studio this past semester were M.Arch II first year students and they were the largest hindrance. They were weak designers and I am only impressed with Emmanuel\u0092s ability to get work out of them.",
    "It is hard to call anything least successful because we were experimenting as a studio all the time. Even if an exercise was a \u0093failure,\u0094 it still lingered. Although I mentioned before that the schedule was a little loose, the constant exploration of thestudio itself was refreshing in both a positive and negative sense.",
    "I had never been in a studio that was as physical model intensive and found that this was an excellent, albeit time-consuming, way to investigate issues in the studio. Group pin-ups, while useful, would have been more beneficial if a slightly larger variety of faculty members were able to sit in from time to time.",
    "Having pinups twice a week (whether with the whole group or just us with E.P.) wasvery strenuous and demanding but also forced us to produce a lot of really great stuff. We were forced to bring our work to a point of resolution twice a week simply because of the format in which we were talking to E.P. about it.I wish that the program and intent of the studio was more clearly defined. Yes, it was about creating an architecture that responded to Bauman's ideas on liquid modernity. But it was also very much an off-the-cuff formalist studio, which sometimes seemed in conflict with deriving a new architecture that responds to liquid modernity.But, overall: absolutely the best studio I've had at Yale. It intellectually challenged me in a way that I've been craving but have never gotten here until now. Big thank you to Emmanuel.",
    "The group pin-ups were helpful but probably not necessary to do so often.Having Eduardo come by to our reviews was also helpful because he was able to give us a fresh perspective and other viewpoint.I think one or two more weeks focused on the actual building design part would have resulted in much more resolved projects that would better match the ambitions of the studio.",
    "the most valuable aspects were the 1 on 1 pin ups with emmanuel, i think the beginning of the semester had a few too many studio pin ups, but they were still somewhat useful to get an idea for the overall attitude of the studio.",
    "I feel like meeting every studio day as a group was helpful towards the beginning of the semester and would have been helpful if we did it a bit more towards the end. Having another critic's voice in the studio I think would have been helpful."
