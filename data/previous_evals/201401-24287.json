    "This is one of the few courses that deeply explores 'Energy' from a variety of different perspectives including policy, social science, engineering and economics. The Professor has a wide and varied experience and is very knowledgeable about all things related to energy in the political realm as well as the technical aspects. I liked the depth of the course and the fact that we looked at specific issues in great detail and I now feel like I actually learned some things that I can apply to situations in real life, especially if I were to take on a role in energy policy or consulting.",
    "Subject area - we definitely need a course on energy policy. And a class that discusses nuclear. Kessides has very good knowedge in utility theory -- more on this with case studies would have been great.",
    "the professor's depth and breadth of knowledge, the discussions in class on days when everybody participated",
    "I really enjoyed the in-class discussions. Dr. Kessides was very open to student questions and would often go off on interesting tangents based on student questions. Despite the tangents, he seemed very able to keep the class on schedule.",

    "Lectures were a bit dry, they need to be more interactive. Testing should be more frequent to ensure that students actually study the material.",
    "Kessides did not cover some basic energy related policies like RPS, FIT or a carbon tax. These were major oversights I think. We spent too much time on renewables, which isn't his area of expertise.Also, the readings were often posted just hours before class - way too late! The final research paper I think was too long and not very helpful for students in the class. There seemed to be no accountability for the shorter papers, and we never got any of them back. As a result, it was hard to know what he was looking for in the final paper.Class itself was often a bit boring due to lecture style and text-heavy slides, but I do appreciate that he lets students jump in.",
    "the three hour lecture style. would be much better in two 1.5 hour sessions. the teacher should have been more responsive to student feedback on the syllabus in the first couple of weeks to eliminate overlaps with other courses and satisfy curriculum gaps. the reading responses should have real deadlines and readings should be incorporated into in-class lectures and discussions.",
