   "comments": [
    "This is an absolutely amazing course! The discussions and lectures are interesting, and the workload is very reasonable (Midterm exam, take home final, 2 reading responses and 1 800 word op-ed). I would highly recommend this course!",
    "This class is an undiscovered gem. It'll change the way you look at everything. This class is completely accessible (even to me, a science major) without being shallow -- it really is a law class. This stuff is relevant to everyone, no matter what your major, and you will have a much better understanding of world conflicts past and present, and what all those people are saying on the news. And Soo is one of the best professors I've ever had. Take this class. Start cr\/d\/f if you need to, but take it for sure.",
    "Absolutely take this course! Soo is an amazing teacher. Her lectures are very organized, and she does a great job at facilitating discussion. I feel like I learned so much during this course and looked forward to every class (which is saying a lot given that it was at 9 am). Soo limits the readings to about 30-40 pages per class session, so there's not an inordinate amount of work, and the readings are actually really interesting. Definitely recommend this class to anyone with even a passing interest in human rights.",
    "Absolutely. I enjoyed the legal aspect of the course.",
    "TAKE IT!!! Taking this course was one of the best decisions I made all semester. I am not a morning person, and I looked forward to this class every morning, even at 9am! There were really cool guest speakers who came very frequently and gave a practical lens to the material with their own real-world experiences. Professor Soo is also really knowledgeable and leads the class like a large seminar, getting to know our names and asking discussion questions. Readings are really interesting and relevant, and the workload is very manageable as well! I procrastinated on my other readings with this class' readings! Also, go to Schell law school events! Soo is such a great resource if you are even vaguely interested in human rights work!",
    "Yes. It's a very interesting course.",
    "Yes -- take it if you want to learn about international human rights and leave class knowing more about the histories, individuals, and policies that have shaped human rights up until this point.",
    "Highly recommend this course to other students. It makes you think critically about human rights issues, and makes you think more broadly about them. I came in with a very narrow definition\/perception of what human rights are and this class helped broaden that. The discussion\/occasional lecture format of the class is great, and all the amazing guest speakers professor Kwon helped bring in really made the class special as well. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I really enjoyed the material that we talked about in the class, particularly in the second half of the semester when we got to more case studies. At first, there was a lot of theory and a lot of dense knowledge about treaties, conventions, and charters, etc. which I understand was necessary in order to be able to talk about future case studies, but I found it to be a little dry. Overall, I'm glad I took the course, Soo's amazing and so passionate, but it wasn't exactly what I expected. I'd say shop it and look at the syllabus and see if you're really interested in it before taking it.",
    "Definitely recommend this class!! Great introduction to human rights, even if it is not your major it gives you a great background to understand some current human rights issues and expands your ability for critical thinking. Very reminiscent of a law school class.",
    "'I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in social justice issues, as long as they understand and do not mind the law-focus of the human rights regime. This course superbly introduces human rights-- its institutions, texts, debates, and, perhaps most important, critiques. Each class meeting focuses on a different human rights debate or area of special interest, ranging from whether rights are universal or relative to what role development should play in the movement. By far, this class's greatest strength is its critical focus. This focus is particularly important given that zealous advocacy so pervades the human rights movement. Taking a step back to look the movement's broader context, we can see what sociologists call the unanticipated consequences of social action. For instance, do international human rights legal recourse suppress organic, local social and political movements? Thinking hard about these questions, through interesting readings and discussions, helped me develop more nuanced view of the movement. Soo very much made this the focus of the course and did an amazing job helping us navigate through the many questions, but always encouraging us to find our own answers.",
    "The class is a great introduction to human rights law- a great way to figure out if this path is for you.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. Although the course is listed as African Studies, it actually goes over the general themes about human rights, and especially a lot about international law. You will learn a lot, really. Take it!",
    "I really enjoyed AFST 361. We went into a lot of depth on a subject that I had never had an opportunity before to study in an academic context. Professor Kwon did an excellent job making the legal content of the course accessible to everyone, even people like myself who have never studied the law before. Furthermore, her previous experience in the field, and excitement about the subject matter, was an asset to the course. She was kind, supportive, and incredibly knowledgeable. Although the textbook did not cover all of the issues we discussed in satisfying detail, the supplemental readings filled the gap, and were especially helpful to illustrate practical social and legal implications of the implementation of human rights law (or the lack thereof). I really enjoyed the opportunity to write a 17 page research paper as opposed to the take-home final, and through this experience learned a lot about the intersection between the topics covered in this class and my field of study (development economics)."
