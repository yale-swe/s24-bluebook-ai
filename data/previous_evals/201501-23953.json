    "I would recommend RLST 276, especially if you have no contact with Catholic theology. It's a good intro course.",
    "Yes yes yes! Professor Turner is brilliant, thoughtful, witty, caring, charming, and did I say brilliant? I have had several professors that I've loved, but only with Professor Turner was I able to consistently leave class in a better mood, and for two reasons. The first is that he has a fabulous sense of humor, that simply enlivened the material. The second is that in his brilliance, he consistently got me to think about some major (sometimes even basic) theological concept in a completely new, eye-opening way. It was all very rewarding and enjoyable. I loved the material of this class, but Professor Turner truly made the experience what it was.",
    "Overall, the class was what I expected: an study of the Summa Theologiae by Thomas Aquinas. You technically do not need any background on Aquinas or Catholicism, but in some of the earlier lectures he made a lot of references for which you needed some working knowledge of Catholicism. I enjoyed the class, but I think it would work better as a seminar. If you like your classes to be more structured, this will not work for you.",
    "Take it, this course is powerful.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone looking for an amazing course in religious studies. Thomas Aquinas' theology is exceptional in itself, and Professor Turner's teaching style made it extraordinary. One of the best classes I have ever had the pleasure of attending.",
    "If you have any interest in the pre-modern mind and how people thought before the age of Locke, take this class! Medieval thought can definitely still be applied today, and it's more \"enlightened\" than one might suspect. Aquinas is great and Denys Turner is almost as great, with all of his self-deprecating humor and Britishness. He was very helpful. If you're a Catholic with any questions about your faith, this is also obviously a great class to take.",
    "This is an excellent course for any with an interest in Thomas, medieval theology, Catholicism, or Christianity at large.",
    "This was one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale. It was a model course for what a course in the liberal arts should look like. The material is rich and challenging and Professor Turner is absolutely brilliant, extraordinarily kind, and dedicated to his students intellectual development. This class will give you a broad survey of Thomas thought on a range of topics. Prof. Turner has some slightly heterodox interpretations of Thomistic texts, but he was always excited to engage in debates over interpretations and nuances at the end of class and it would be impossible not to learn a great deal by taking this course. You should absolutely take this course, but be careful; this class might very well shake the foundations of how you look at the world, as any serious class should.",
    "Denys is a brillant person and professor and it is worth taking any of his classes merely on that merit alone. This course managed to make a difficult subject (Aquinas) relatively manageable. However, it was stressful that the only grade in the class was the final paper."
