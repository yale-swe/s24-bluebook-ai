    "Take it if you have to. It isn't a fun course the way 241 is unfortunately.",
    "I would recommend this course. Sometimes Barron's teaching is a little hard to follow but there are lots of resources online and in the book to help where you are confused. The midterm was very easy and the final wasn't bad. While this course will give you a good understanding of the underlying concepts of statistics some of the more practical applications. It would be very good accompanied with STAT 230.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in the area and want to understand the material rigorously. Otherwise, you may as well take a 100 level statistics course.",
    "A good introductory class to statistics. I would recommend it to anyone with an intension to use statistics in research.",
    "Teaching was fairly good up until the midterm and then classes got fairly confusing, even though the material on psets and exams was very straightforward. Somehow material was hugely overcomplicated in lecture to the point that is was difficult to understand at many times. Professor Barron is very helpful outside of class though, and he will make sure you understand the material if you meet with him. I would recommend this class if you need to take 241\/242 as pre-reqs or a major requirement. I wish I had learned more stats after spending an entire year in 241\/242, although my experience in 242 was much better than in 241.",
    "Confusing lectures that are almost always proofs, so don't help with the homeworks too much. Makes going to class 3x a week at 9:25 a struggle because you know you won't learn much. The textbook is good, and a lot of homework solutions are online, if you're really stuck. It's sort of a necessary evil just to get through, but try to get as much as you can out of it, and it will definitely be less painful than STAT 241 just because the material is more straightforward.",
    "It's a good course if you want to understand the fundamentals behind data analysis and modeling. However if you have no interest in that I wouldn't recommend.",
    "Very great class to introduce you to the field of statistics, the tool dofr predicting the future.",
    "Yes it is overall a good class.",
    "If you took 241, take 242"
