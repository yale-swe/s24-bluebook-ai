    "Good",
    "Physics 523 is a survey course in the physical approaches to biology. It's very basic, and only introductory physics and biology knowledge is required. Everything is very comprehensible and interesting. I would definitely recommend the class to any student, especially undergraduates with an interest in biophysics.",
    "I would recommend this class to others. It was a good difficulty level and the various modules interesting.",
    "As it is, it's a good intro to quantitative biology if you don't have a physics background. Not so good for physicist interested in bio, I'd bet, since about that we learned very little. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a good course. You don't need any biology background at all to take this course. It is significantly less work than other physics graduate level classes.",
    "This course is good for those looking for an overview of prominent concepts in modern biophysics. I would also recommend it to those just interested in the topic, as the instructors were able to express interesting topics with great enthusiasm.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's less of an in-depth survey class and more of an introduction into several different types of biophysics problems and the methods you might use to approach them. You get to do a lot of your own simulations and sometimes compare them to results from the literature, which is great. As a bio student I found it completely accessible, though a little programming familiarity would help.",
    "No, just because I found it more frustrating than anything. I did learn a lot and I appreciate a challenge, but I felt that this course was a continuous headache. In-class assignments I think would help with this, as they would help the instructor convey a particular concept while allowing the students as opportunity to put concepts into application. I had a difficult time with Matlab assignments, as I had never laid a finger on Matlab before this class. I feel more instruction is necessary, as There was many times where I understood what the homework wanted us to do, but I had no idea how to implement into Matlab.",
    "Really easy if you know matlab.",
    "This course covers basic biophysical principles and is great for students with a physics or biology background. Students need a strong background in computer science before taking this class. I would recommend this to students if they had the right background."

    "Yes",
    "The course gave me an excellent idea of what computational research, especially simulations, would be like. The modeling in Matlab provided an opportunity to thoroughly understand concepts by creating visual and testable applications of our coursework.",
    "This is completely unrelated to my dissertation or research, but it was a fun course.",
    "I do not feel this course helped me expand my knowledge of biophysics as I had hoped. Due to the incongruous lectures and lack of association between the lecture and homework, I do not feel I was able to fully comprehend the concepts that were meant to be discussed in depth during class.Additionally, I was hoping to use this course as way to learn MatLab while focusing on its uses that would be useful to my research. However, I do not feel that I have any more of an understanding of how to use MatLab for biophysics than I did before the class.",
    "This course certainly gave me a better conceptual grasp of the main concepts in biological physics. It will certainly have a contribution to my research interests, though to what degree is uncertain.",
    "Thinking about biology from a physical perspective. Use of Matlab",
    "",
    "I don't think i learned much lasting information from this class. But I did learn useful programming techniques for modeling biological activities."
