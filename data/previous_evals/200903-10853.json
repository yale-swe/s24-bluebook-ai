    "This class is fantastic - I learned so much, and so many actual, practicable skills. The workload is immense, not for the difficulty, but for the time involved. I can't say enough good things about the class, and recommend it to all junior students interested in forest management.A few other comments from these questions:2. Some of my classmates felt John (very well-meaningly) belabored some of his points. I say this only because it's very easy to address, and will make the class better. I never felt that way, but I was also super into the data analysis, for example, and so 100% cared about things like pivot tables and the like. But maybe being mindful of that feedback next time the course is offered would help remedy that feedback.",
    "This was the most time-consuming course I have taken at FES.",
    "This was a very intense hands-on course which provided students with essential technical and professional skills. It fostered a lot of collaborative effort through working in multi-skilled groups. As a group we learned a lot from each other and felt very relevant because we were working with real clients and helping solve real life problems in the field. It was however a very intense course requiring students to be out in the field most Fridays and some Saturdays and Sundays. A very tasking but enjoyable learning experience.",
    "This course is exceptional. I learned a lot, most of it from doing the work. The lectures were valuable but the work with the client was irreplaceable.",
    "This was the best class I have taken yet. Most practical, most useful."

    "The teamwork, the difficulty of our project (I had Lakeridge), the challenge provided by our client and all of their stakeholders, the many components of private land management that we learned, spending my entire Thanksgiving week struggling through the data analysis one column at a time. Learning pivot tables was a highlight. Participating in several key developments in our project work was very satisfying - I've made huge contributions to the forest inventory data analysis, the synthesis of the social survey and the direction of that write up, and now the final shape of our document. I also wrote our biophysical sampling methodology, so throw that in there, too. We all got to do and learn a lot.",
    "The experience of actually being a consultant and dealing with real clients. The application of physical and natural science was also extremely helpful in grounding what I have learned at FES so far.",
    "Practical skills learned.Skills exchange.Confidence that I can undertake such a hefty project and succeed.Time spent outdoors instead of in classroom.",
    "The course was well balanced between the acquisition of theory tools and practical exercise in the field.",

   "comments": [
    "There are weeks when we really don't need to meet,because we know what to do but need the time to do it in (and a faculty member free and available to give us feedback and help). Earlier deadlines would be helpful, or perhaps not planning on making the first draft available at the presentations to the client. My team had a ten hour (straight, all in one room) yesterday to crank our plan out. It definitely was a \"doesn't-kill-you-makes-you-stronger\" scenario, but I came home exhausted (yet happy).",
    "The quality of the lectures was poor at times, in particular reference to the visiting professor (Mckenna). His lectures were often dull, un-engaging and too detail focused. Also, more background info should be provided to students on their particular property.",
    "Not sure how much John added to the course as an extra instructor.Social science instructor with Mark may add more new info to the class, as was done in the past.",
    "More logistics need to be provided. Students had to drive their private cars to the field on a number of occasions and field gear was not always adequate (especially GPS and protective clothing)",
    "Mark might need to be slightly more selective when choosing clients. There needs to be more communication with the client by the instructors before the class to make sure that what the client wants and what we are prepared to offer are closely aligned. Our client was not very interested in the bulk of what our management plan addressed and writing a management plan for a client that won't read the document is not very fulfilling nor does it urge you to produce your best work. This never has to be the case if there is proper communication before the class.",
    "Increased communication regarding expectations for both the client and the students.",

    "Mark Ashton was helpful at points to keep us moving along. He also was very helpful out in the field. Marlyse was a big help with plant id and for group encouragement. John Mckenna was very responsive via email but because he lives far away, he was not very accessible.",
    "Marlyse was awesome and went way out of her way to make sure we were doing things well and that our questions were answered. She would make an awesome second-instructor to the course, especially with her knowledge of CT plants.John and Mark deeply impressed me with how they read our plan in such short time periods and gave comments back to us quickly. John especially would email us at 3 am when we had questions. Incredible.",
    "The intructor and TA were available in need and did provide thorough explanations to our concerns.",
    "Both instructors and TA were very helpful and they were with the teams in the field on many occasions offering the necessary support. In the case of Prof. Ashton, his commitment was amazing and unequaled,intelligent, easy going and approachable and always willing to go the extra mile to assist his students. A model instructor.",

But you kind of hope you'll learn everything, and instead you become the manager of the area you are strong in. I don't think this is bad, but it's more like a consultancy in this regard.",
    "Yes, I learned particularly a lot about the social side of natural resource management.",

    "I had a fantastic, fantastic group. Really good, hardworking, consistent people who pretty uniformly delivered good work on time.The only challenge is that in big groups it is sometimes hard to evenly distribute work. We managed that by being very proactive about offering to do additional stuff. It all worked out.",
    "There was one straggler in the group that frustrated other group members. Other than this one person, the group was hard-working and a pleasure to work in.",
    "We all got to learn a piece of the work without feeling like we had to tackle something new. It was great skills sharing.That being said, if the project went on for one more week this semester, I may have lost it on one of my group members for not doing the same amount of work as everyone else in the group. I actually expected this to be more of a problem given evaluations I've read for this course, but our group, for the most part, worked out pretty nicely.",
    "The advantages of the group work are how the work can be done speedy and knowledge you can grasp from your counterparts. It disavantage are the difficulty of coordination and the way an error from one can empede on the one of others.",
    "A great learning experience within a multi-skilled group",
    "The entire class is one group assignment.",
    "The class was actually more difficult than I had anticipated, but with the skills of the group combined, we each contributed in our unique ways, which lessened the work load and decreased the learning curve.",
    "This was a time consuming course. Some members of the group didn't have the time needed to commit to the course. You will have that I guess."

    "This morning I told my roommate that this was the only class I have taken here that I know will inform almost everyday of my professional career - if not for the actual tree management bits, for the interpersonal skills, information management strategies, client management, teamwork, and presentation design. How's that for advice? ;)Also, this is a six credit course for a reason. You will spend every free weekend day, and many weekdays, of your semester in the field. If you don't like\/want to do fieldwork, get out now. For me it was wonderful to find myself back in the trees in the fall, rather than at a computer (although I spent a good amount of time there, too). Do not enroll in extra credits because you only have three classes if this is one of them. Trust me, you will use up more than two classes worth of time on this one class.Get a group that you like, and start off with a strong foundation of your common expectations. Then kick ass, and take names.",
    "It is extremely important to choose your group and worksite wisely. This could make or break your experience.",
    "Do your understory early before the leaves fall off.Split up jobs, and meet again in a week fully expecting everyone to have finished their job. Keep people accountable and make sure they actually do what they're assigned. Come up with a method early on in the project by which you can, as a group, tell someone who is slacking that they need to get with it.",
    "Be ready to work at very remote areas and over the week end.",
    "A great learning experience that draws from many fields i.e social, ecological, historical, economics etc. This is a very intense course that will require you being in the field for several long days. Come prepared to work hard to meet strict deadlines. But more importantly come prepared to listen to your clients and learn from your colleagues.",
    "Do not wait until you are approaching the deadline to actually start writing sections of the plan. This should be a more gradual process, not one to be done in the few days before the presentation.Also, if a group member is not holding their own, it is important to address this earlier rather than later as this problem may not fix itself.",
    "Pay attention to deadlines. Have regular meetings to make sure everyone is doing what needs to be done.",
    "This class is very time consuming. Do all of your data collection early, before the leaves fall off the plants.Continually adapt to the changing understanding of the project goals. Answers to your first question will likely lead to more and different questions. Leave room for adaptation to this process.",
