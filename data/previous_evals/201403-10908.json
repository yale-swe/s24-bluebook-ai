   "comments": [
    "This is an introduction to opera from a media studies angle. I would highly recommend it to other students.",
    "The course attempted to find a meeting point for STS, media studies, and opera studies, particularly relating to Wagner. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "This course is an eclectic survey sitting at the intersections of technology, media studies, Wagner and opera more broadly speaking. I would definitely recommend this seminar to other students, due especially to the focus on technology and media studies work from other disciplines. I think the course generally struck a good balance between the intellectual\/disciplinary areas it juggled. The course was structured flexibly and adjusted itself according to the developing interests of seminar members. Of special interest was our guest, sound designer Mark Grey, who shared some of his experiences in the field on the Met opera stage. Another noteworthy part of the class that I found helpful to gain traction on the modes of thinking we developed was to view a Met opera broadcast and think through it in the terms of some of the readings.",
    "This course explores the intersection of technology and media studies with opera and theater studies, with Wagner as something of a focal point (or test case) for many of the class sessions. I highly recommend the course for anyone remotely interested in pursuing any of these areas, as I found that each of these fields reflected on the others in fascinating ways."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It provided an introduction to the literature in media studies that might be useful for music scholars, and also hinted at the various directions in which media approaches have been used in our field already.",
    "The course was closely concerned with my own interests, and as such it will be immensely useful as I determine my dissertation topic in the coming months.",
    "This interdisciplinary course broadened my perspective in rewarding ways.",
    "Having come into the seminar with little knowledge of or understanding of opera, I now feel that I have a foothold for future explorations in this area. While I am as yet unsure how these materials may figure into future dissertation research, I was exposed to composers and intellectual resources that I would certainly consider incorporating into a dissertation project.",
    "This course perhaps broadened rather than deepend my knowledge of the discipline (if it's even possible to speak of the course in terms of a single discipline), in ways that will likely impact my scholarship and ways of thinking about the topics involved. I hope to continue to pursue aspects of media, technology, and sound studies in the future, so this course will almost certainly have a significant impact on my work."
