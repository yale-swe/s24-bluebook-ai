   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to another student. It's an excellent opportunity to build cohort unity, learn about each others' work, and support each others' research process.",
    "I would summarize it as a comprehensive research seminar in which we focus to develop our particular projects through workshopping. I would recommend this course for another student who was trying to develop a chapter in their dissertation.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it. I would especially recommend it for first years since it allowed me to develop a project that I will continue working on as well as to fulfill the research requirement without very strict parameters on research topics.",
    "American Studies 601 is an independent research course that provides students with weekly opportunities to workshop their own research topics. During the first few weeks of the semester, students discuss a variety of readings on transnational research questions and methodologies. Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student because of Professor Camacho's excellent feedback and dedication to students. I also appreciated the opportunity to workshop my project with peers."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "In addition to what I said above, it is worth noting that I'm very glad to have had the opportunity to read and discuss more about American Studies and the major debates currently taking place in the discipline.",
    "This course deepened my dissertation research by expanding what will hopefully be a chapter of my research, for my dissertation. This allowed me to conduct small amounts of archival research, which I hope to continue to improve.",
    "This project will probably feed into my dissertation project. It gave me a chance to see what archives are relevant to my research interests, and also to do some preliminary archival work. I also really enjoyed our early discussions on the state of the field, especially the \"transnational turn.\" In general, it was great to listen to my classmates' research interests and it gave me a better idea of how my own research relates to their interests as well as to the broader field.",
    "This course taught me different ways of approaching my research interests. It also encouraged me to think about the major questions and conversations in the field of American Studies. Seminar conversations and work with peers taught me to recognize my strengths and weaknesses as a writer, while individual conversations with Professor Camacho helped me to think about how my research interests fit within the broader field of American Studies."
