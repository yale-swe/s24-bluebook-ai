    "Great class. MBB seniors should take it. Make sure to start brainstorming for the paper after Spring break though.",
    "MB&B 445 is a great elective. The only problem with it is the meeting time (7-9pm) and the location (Bass). None of the professors really interacted with us much, except for Mark, who was great! He's laid back and fun, but he will call you out if you don't know your stuff, so make sure you're prepared. Don't be scared off by that, he'll definitely help walk you through anything you don't understand\/got wrong. Some of the students in this class were gunners, which was kind of annoying because they liked to dominate the discussion. Thankfully, Mark was always good at moderating and making sure everyone had a chance to speak.",
    "Methods is a great course to learn about the thought process behind experiments. Two papers per week may seem like a drag, but at the end of the day, the course teaches you a lot about reading papers critically. An 8 page proposal to a followup experiment for one of the papers read is due at the end of the semester along with a short 10 minute presentation. Overall, would recommend.",
    "It's a good course. It would be a lot better if it weren't from 7-9pm all the way up science hill. The walk back down is cold and dark for most of the semester and doesn't feel particularly safe.",
    "This has been a good class. It is not phenomenal, like the reviews seem to indicate, but I think because of this class I am a better scientist and I can think more critically about scientific data and arguments.",
    "A great course for filling the MB&B elective. Work load isn't too heavy, and it's interesting to work through the thought process behind most of the experiments in the papers. Make sure you actually focus on doing the reading ahead of time (and not just skimming it). The class is a lot more enjoyable when everyone is engaged.",
    "I don't see any reason not to take this class. You get to learn how to read a scientific paper- and that is not a trivial thing."
