   "comments": [
    "Gave me a much better understanding of how to solve integrals and deal with series.",
    "In this course, I learned all the necessary skills and tactics associated with second level calculus, such as integration techniques, manipulation of series, differential equations, and more. Also in this course, I was able to hone my problem-solving skills and approach each question with a clear mind and ample techniques of how to find the solution.",
    "I developed new skills in integration and problem solving. It continued my education in mathematics. I walked away not only being able to solve certain problems, but to also discern from information new problems and relate concepts to others.",
    "The course improved my knowledge of calculus very much as the pset problems were often challenging and our class did somewhat tougher problems. We did lots of work on sequences, series, power series, and taylor series.",
    "I learned important mathematics skills. I learned how to reason through difficult problems and how to use calculus to evaluate real-world problems.",
    "My fundamental understanding of calculus certainly improved over this semester because of this course. I also came to realize how relevant calculus is to other STEM courses I have taken (Physics, Astronomy), and how important it is to possess calculus skills in order to advance in these fields.",
    "I developed a deeper knowledge of the calculus that I had learned in high school."

   "comments": [
    "I found this course to overall be quite strong. I was able to learn all the necessary material easily from my professor, and there were always ample practice problems to facilitate in learning. Although math does not necessarily come easily to me and it takes time to grasp the material, I was still able to manage well in the class. There are not really any improvements I would recommend, other than double checking the Coursera videos, as many of them had problems (answers were incorrect, technical difficulties, etc.).",
    "One of the strengths of this course was certainly the Coursera prep problems and the online videos that explained the topics of the week. It made what we learned in class the next day a lot more digestible, and helped me come to class prepared to ask questions.",
    "Weaknesses: Not a fan of \"learn at home.\" Though if it's to stay, it probably cannot be better than it is. Also, there are issues with Coursera. Lastly, the sample problems are not always linearly related to material in the videos. I had to review topics in the textbook before answering some of them. Strengths: My T.A. was great. I felt the class was not too hard, nor too easy. Mr. Pham is unmatched and genuinely interested in having his students understand and succeed. The textbook was abbreviated and well-written. P-Sets were not burdens. Exams fluctuated in difficulty and focuses (between years), required mastery.",
    "I was often left behind a bit in class - I usually understood the topic, but the examples in class seemed abstract so I was not completely keeping up with it. But our pset problems were challenging so they prepared us well.",
    "The videos are helpful and I benefitted from a good professor, willing to go the extra mile by making practice exams for us to make sure we understood the material.",
    "Discuss the videos in class more",
    "I found that the problem sets challenged me very fairly, and adequately reflected what we learned in class. I also enjoyed the coursera videos, as they were a great way to reinforce taught material. However, I struggled with submitting some answers to the quizzes due to technical and formatting difficulties.",
    "The course had an excellent peer tutoring program, and the two tutors I worked with this semester were very helpful in explaining concepts I did not understand. The videos were also helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student looking to take second level calculus. It is a perfectly manageable course, although not easy, that any student at Yale would be able to handle. Also, I felt the material was taught in a very clear way and was just interesting and challenging enough to keep students engaged in class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I dropped down from Math 120, and if you have never taken Multi-Variable Calculus before and don't have an particularly math-inclined mind, Math 115 is a much better place to start.",
    "It's a very standard math course, I believe. You get what you give. It's hard but entirely doable. Not something to give a half-hearted effort. Show up to class, do the problem sets diligently and you'll be rewarded with new and important knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and Prof. Lam Pham to others. He is amazing. The math professors at Yale usually aren't that good but Prof. Lam is great. he always challenges his students with questions that appear difficult but actually are solvable with basic knowledge. His strategy of teaching is super helpful especially when it comes to exams; you become used to being challenged in class and so when you encounter a difficult problem, you have an idea of what to do in order to solve it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to be proficient in calculus and who doesn't mind a challenge. It may not be the most interesting class sometimes but it covers a good amount of material which gives you a good knowledge of single variable calculus.",
    "I would. I think the concepts involved in the course are useful for economics and other majors involving mathematics.",
    "To a student that loves math",
    "Yes. Great first semester calculus course. Really helped me solidify my skills."
