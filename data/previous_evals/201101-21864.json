    "The EM lab is a pretty representative upper-division lab in biology. It's a semester-long \"experiment\" where you're in charge of your success. While the work isn't terribly difficult, it is time-consuming, and you will need to spend at least 2-3 hours per week outside of the designated lab time in order to fully complete your project. At the end, though, the body of photographs and analysis you produce is pretty cool. Unlike your lower level labs, there are no regular lab reports, only two large papers and a final presentation. And Barry is really a great professor to learn from. Just make sure you're really interested in EM and histology, otherwise this is not the course for you.",
    "Absolutely. It's a fair amount of work for a lab, but it's really interesting work. It's way less boring than a class with a bunch of random lab reports you don't care about it. My favorite lab at yale.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this lab. You work on one project throughout the entire semester rather than many different ones. The workload is completely manageable if you spread it out and Barry is a wonderful instructor.",
    "Electron Microscopy Lab is awesome! You go through the entire process of tissue imaging, from chemical fixation of tissues (that you get to slice yourself), to embedding the tissues, staining them, sectioning them into ultra thin slices, to imaging themusing light and electron microscopy. You learn the correct way to calibrate a light microscope (which few people actually know how to do- it's pretty complicated) and the theory and operation of transmission electron microscopes. The images you see are amazing: cristae of mitochondria, nuclear pores, rough ER, microtubules, etc. You also learn fine techniques such as knife-making.Over the course of the semester, you work at your own pace (w\/ a few schedule reminders) on the organ you picked. You learn the techniques in the order they're needed. Barry Piekos is an expert&a great instructor; he'll sit down w\/ you to answer any questions you have in detail. The procedures are often complicated and require a lot of practice. By the 3rd week, you'll need to spend extra time on non-class days. But, there are no lab reports. Instead, there's a 10-page intro paper on your organ of study and a 25-30 page final paper + presentation due during Reading Week. Work on the image analysis as you go along in the semester&you won't be stressed at the end."
