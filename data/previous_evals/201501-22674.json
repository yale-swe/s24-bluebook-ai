   "comments": [
    "If you're into psych, its interesting, but only do it for a grade if you're good at multiple choice \"choose the most right answer\"kind of questions.",
    "Big Psych lecture, you learn about a lot if interesting studies. He covers pretty much all of the readings in class, and the exams are fair, class-based, and mostly multiple choice. Pretty good class, especially if you're looking for a lighter 5th credit",
    "Very simple, great material, a cool professor. There's a lot of reading, but it isn't particularly important for the tests.",
    "This class was just okay. I personally thought the material was rather interesting and exciting but at times it can get too repetitive. The midterm and final were ridiculously difficult in that there was no curve and the questions were often quite challenging. Might be a gut in the sense that there is literally no work (although one probably should do the readings) but getting an A is not an easy task by any means. Would only recommend this class as a Credit D. Not worth taking for a grade.",
    "If you're into cog. sci. and want to get beyond a surface level-interaction, I would avoid it. I took it as a fun gut (Cr-D) and had a great time, though!",
    "If you need a social science, the workload is pretty low. That said, I didn't love it.",
    "Good credit d",
    "It's amazing!! Highly recommend; you learn so so much about behavior!!",
    "terrible curve. hard class, even for Credit\/D",
    "Yes and no. The topic is fascinating but the experience is passive. You have to weigh the pros and cons before taking the class.",
    "The subject matter of CGSC 315 is pretty interesting - you learn about a lot of experiments that may be of relevance to your own life. This is a great class to take Credit\/D or if you have taken a class with Bargh before and are used to his confusing lecturing style. There's no section which is clutch, but the grade is purely based on midterm and final (50% each) and the questions are randomly hard.",
    "I'd recommend it. Not much work (50% midterm, 50% final) and the tests aren't bad as long as you come to class. Material is interesting and some of the findings from the studies are pretty cool. Also Prof. Bargh is an interesting lecturer.",
    "A great class if you're interested in psych, not really a gut though.",
    "Yes. Great class if you are looking for a class with a low workload. Tests are tough, but if you go to lecture, Professor Bargh does a great job of explaining everything you need to know. Lectures almost always got out early. Overall, loved this class.",
    "You do actually need to put in minimal effort, even if you are taking Credit\/D\/Fail. It is an interesting class so it's worth the effort. I learned some interesting things, and if you have taken previous psych classes there is a lot of overlap, which is good if you're looking for a lighter workload.",
    "Kind of interesting material but the lectures are incredibly boring and there is no overarching structure to the class.",
    "A direct, simple lecture course that requires little work, but can get very dry if you're not interested in the material.",
    "A perfect 5th class or CR\/D. Information is decently interesting, the notes are all online, and the only grades are a midterm and a final. I had a really weak psych\/cog sci background, and I feel like I could have gotten more out of this class if I had a better foundation. But it was good for what it is -- a large, stress-free, painless course.",
    "Cool topic with varying lecture interest. Good credit D",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It changes the way you think about and understand everyday phenomena. The class itself is not a lot of work, but be sure to take good notes during lecture.",
    "A good course on cute psychological experiments and effects.",
    "A very fun and interesting class - it will make you start thinking about your own thoughts and behaviors in new ways. The lectures are enjoyable and Professor Bargh covers the topics in a memorable way. Don't be intimidated by the fact that there are only two grades (the two midterms). As long as you do the assigned readings and pay attention in lecture, the exams are very fair.",
    "This is a nice course to learn about many studies regarding the unconscious. If the unconscious and\/or behavioral studies in cognitive science is something that interests you, I would recommend this course. It is straightforward and I found myself truly interested in the studies we were discussing.",
    "Quite possibly the perfect credit\/D course, and pretty interesting to boot.",
    "Easy and interesting! Take this if you're interested in understanding what the mind does unconsciously versus consciously. If you go to lecture and take good notes you'll be fine on the exams.",
    "Interesting class; not very demanding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you need an easy social science credit. There was no work besides a midterm and final. There were readings, but they were discussed in class. If you go to class every day (which isn't a drag because the material is interesting! I looked forward to class), you won't have to study too much or cram for the exams.",
    "A general overview of psychology that Bargh is interested in, with a focus on conscious v. unconscious processing. Course readings are covered fairly well in class (so you may not need to do the reading) and class lets out ~25 minutes early every time. Bargh is not the best lecturer, but he knows what he's talking about and tries his best to connect with students so they don't get bored\/stop paying attention. There's no section, so your grade in the class depends fully on how well you do on two midterms, which are rarely curved and can be challenging. I would shop the class, see if you can stand his lecture style, then take it if it interests you.",
    "It's a good course and worth taking if you're a psych or cog sci major. That said, if you don't like cramming for memorization-based exams, you can also probably find other classes that will give you a sense of what social psych is like. Also, I heard that there are a lot of overlaps with social psych, so you might want to take only one of them.",
    "You read papers about men sniffing women's shirts.",
    "Midterm\/final. 72 multiple choice questions with a couple short answers.",
    "Excellent course. The experiments Bargh covers are fascinating. He goes fast but if you pay attention you'll keep up. And there's just two midterms (readings basically optional).",
    "It's a good class for anyone who is wants a low-stress course in cognitive science. But BEWARE - start this course CRED\/D!!!! The midterm is 50% of the grade and the final is another 50%. Nothing else! I thought I was pretty set for the midterm but didn't do so well, and I was so happy I kept it Cred\/D. You should either come to lecture everyday and take very good notes (which is what I did) or read all of the readings - and there are a LOT of readings. The amount of reading would take hours to complete whereas if you take good notes during lecture, you're pretty set for the midterm and final. It's a fun class and you learn a lot of interesting things, a lot of which I looked up and found out more about. Generally really low stress, so definitely recommend it!",
    "Yes, but you must go to class. It's a perfect credit\/d",
    "Only if you're interested in the material otherwise this class can sink you",
    "Great credit d class take it. Midterm final that's it nothing else",
    "The class is fascinating but has a lot of readings. The tests are tricky and can get you. Overall, a good course if you are interested in the subject.",
    "Expansive studies on the unconscious and conscious minds- not a lot of work but the midterm and final are each 50% of your grade",
    "The lectures and slides can be a little difficult to follow at times, but if you're interested in learning more about nonconscious processing, definitely worth it. If you're a psych or cogsci person, I highly recommend this course--it's a really salient reminder that we aren't actually aware of most of what our brains are doing throughout the day.",
    "Pretty interesting class, but don't be surprised by the difficulty of the midterm or lack of a curve. Not as easy as most say.",
    "Yes! Great course with less than average workload.",
    "Pretty low-effort class with straightforward tests. Class = remembering studies.",
    "Big lecture. Show up twice a week and you just get interesting info told at you, then you leave. In short, awesome. If you're looking for a real cool class with not that much work, this is it.",
    "REALLY interesting stuff, but only if you pay attention. I didn't keep up well through the first half, but found myself getting really into it when I studied for the first test, and really felt like I was absorbing a ton of valuable info from the social psychology field. It gives you a good sense about how the discourse develops among academics over time, especially in such a niche area that Bargh himself plays a big role in. The workload is pretty much negligible, but the exams require you to keep up with your stuff. The less you pay attention all year, the more time you need to allocate to studying because you will have to learn every little bit of minutiae for the two 50% tests. Exams don't require that you do the readings, but you may find that you need to while studying to flesh out the gaps in your knowledge from class. Almost all questions come directly from the studies, so take good notes and remember the details.",
    "Good credit d course",
    "Yes the class was interesting",
    "Incredible Credit\/D class but the tests are not easy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! You will learn a lot and although it is a 300 level psych class it is accessible to non-psych people.",
    "Awesome class! Take it! The material is very fascinating, and the tests are really easy if you study.",
    "Fine course, good credit\/D option since your grade is 2 tests worth 50% each. You have to take good notes be his slides are worthless.",
    "The class is 50% midterm and 50% final. It's a light workload but not a guy - given that 46% of the class got a C+ or below on the midterm. Not. Joking. Beware - start credit d. Super interestig stuff though!!",
    "Easy, interesting course! Great for a 5th credit",
    "Interesting survey of social psychology. I would recommend it if you're interested in it, but sometimes it's frustrating because social psych can be a little dicey. Don't forget to study for the two tests which make up your whole grade!",
    "Very cool class with a lot of useful and interesting information.",
    "Why you should be aware of the implicit effects of stimuli, and other stuff that goes on when you're not aware of it.",
    "A lot of readings, but exposes you to interesting ideas.",
    "PSYC 315 is a very interesting class with material that is actually very applicable to real life experiences. There are very few assessments throughout the class so it's important to stay on top of the readings and not leave studying for the exam at the last minute (especially because each of the 2 tests has a lot of material). Overall, an interesting class that is slightly geared towards psychology students but is definitely accessible to all students.",
    "Standard psychology fare: much of the material are disjointed study results, thrown together to make the point that automatic processes drive social, emotional and goal-directed behavior. Read Bargh & Ferguson (2000) for much of the courses punchline. For every study mentioned in class, you should read the abstract, procedures, and broad brushes of the results. Minutiae of studies will feature extensively on the midterms. Since they are the only source of your grade, study both the studies and the slides carefully.",
    "This class pretty easy. It's a low-key way to be exposed to a lot of recent research on the topic of conscious and preconscious processing. It's crazy because Professor Bargh is a giant in this field -- he has authored a bunch of the papers you'll read for class. The grading for this course is 50% midterm, 50% final. That will make the tests stress-inducing and you should prepare for them well. That said, as a result of this grading system there is no motivation whatsoever to keep up with the material regularly as the semester progresses. It's possible to skip a lot of lectures and be fine. The online powerpoints from lecture are a great resource and you should review them carefully before exams. The lectures are definitely worth your time though, because Professor Bargh is chill and very funny.",
    "It's easy. All you have to do is attend the lectures and pay attention. A lot of the material is redundant. The tests are very fair. If you're looking for a light fifth class, take it. But otherwise it's not really worth it.",
    "Great class. No outside classwork other than online reading that isn't on the exam. 1 midterm, 1 non-cumulative in-class final = solid gut, though I went to all the classes and thought a lot of the material was super interesting. Not an easy A if you skip every class though. Also it's almost always a 50 min lecture instead of 75 min. So it's a 2 day per week, 50 min lecture with 2 exams and that's it.",
    "An excellent class that could truly change the lives of those paying attention to the material presented. One of the most important classes I've taken.",
    "The class material is interesting although not presented in the most interesting way. The entire grade is based on two midterms worth 50% each so there is very little work throughout the semester but a lot of studying needed before the two tests, which both occur during the crunch time of the last weeks before spring break and reading period. The tests were hard but definitely doable. A perfect Cr\/D class given the lack of any actual work other than studying for the tests which if you go to class and do a bit of review you should be able to pass.",
    "Great class! I say great because if you actually pay attention, the material is so cool and really interesting because it is applicable to A LOT of every day situations. I even tried some of the things on my peers and it kind of works haha. It explains a lot of human behavior. This class is not for you if you have a hard time paying attention in big lectures. There's no point in taking the class if you are going to skip lecture, because the material just doesn't translate as well\/have the same effect if you're just reading the slides in your room. WARNING; there are only two grades in the entire class--the midterm and final",
    "Good class. If you've taken Social Psych with Bargh, there is a ton of overlap and the first half of the semester will be a mostly a review. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow because they aren't very organized, but if you pay attention and take good notes you'll be fine. A bit scary because the grade is 50% midterm, 50% final, so it's a good class to take Credit\/D. That way, no work is required except studying a little for the two noncumulative tests. If you're interested in psych or like psych classes, this is a good one to take.",
    "I would say that PSYC 315 is a class about the unconscious and how it operates and whether we should trust it or not. You will review major studies and learn why this topic is applicable to our lives. I would recommend PSYCH 315 to another student who is interested in psychology and functions of the brain and mind.",
    "Great, fantastic course. Such interesting material. Professor Bargh summarized and delivered the material with great clarity and engagement. Revolutionized the way I think about the world, my behavior, my relationships with people, the way I think in other disciplines like Philosophy and Economics.",
    "Very important for Management students, especially the ones going into the fields of Marketing and Behavioural Economics",
    "As a cogsci major, I found this class both incredibly interesting and quite easy. A solid 5th class - very little to zero work besides studying for the midterm and final (doing the readings might be a good idea though).",
    "This is a great course to attend, which will widen your eyes definitely. No matter what specialty you are going to focus, this would be a helpful course. It will inspire your thinking.",
    "I very highly recommend this class! It might be a little dense for non-psychology majors, but the material is so interesting that the information would be worth the little extra leg-work (plus there is no work load, so that leg-work would be all that you're contributing). But all psych majors should definitely take this class! The lectures are fascinating, the professor is great, and the exams are very fair.",
    "No homework to hand in at all, but definitely do not skip the lectures. Prof Bargh does a decent job at keeping things interesting, but some of the information was extremely repetitive. Grading seemed to be harsher than average, so think twice about using this as a gut class.",
    "Engaging course about an interesting subject matter; enjoyable lectures",
    "Be prepared to do a lot of readings. And get bad grades on the one midterm and the one final that constitute your grade after not being sure about what to study."
