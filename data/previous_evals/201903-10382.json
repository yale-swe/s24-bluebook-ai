    "From the perspective of a non-Physics major, this was an amazing introduction into the subject, and I learnt how to think about, model, and understand physical phenomena. Furthermore, it was extremely interesting to approach the subject from a part-historical point of view - reading through Einsteins papers and following the progression of his work through his life was definitely a highlight! The problem sets were not dumbed-down either, and were challenging and gratifying to do.",
    "A whole new perspective on the history behind the biggest breakthroughs of Einstein's scientific career, as well as a more rigorous understanding of quantum physics and general\/special relativity theory.",
    "I audited this as a sixth course out of interest and I learned more than I could have imagined. Rarely when you learn anything in the hard sciences do you fully comprehend the historical context, but this course kept everything from statistical mechanics to quantum theory grounded in the history, creating a cohesive and engaging greater story, while making the math and physics behind the work of Einstein that much more arresting.",
    "You learn the physics and history of Einstein's achievements, along with their contextual counterparts."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Stone explains the material very well, even to an extremely novice audience, and the seminar style really allows a great deal of engaging and enlightening discussion. I loved the small class size - we all got to hear each others opinions out, and help each other master the material better. I would just suggest timing the assignments better, so that the final paper and second midterm are not in such close proximity - that creates a very stress-inducing situation indeed.",
    "Strengths: the small class makes the course far more engaging than most physics classes at Yale. The professor is dedicated and passionate about the material, and and subject matter is fascinating (and pretty unique for a physics class, with the mix of physics and history). The people were amazing, and being in class was usually really fun. I don't think there's practically any science class at Yale that's this personalized and fun, while still being rigorous, challenging, and with an actual mathematical approach to the physics and the derivations of everything (i.e., while not being a \"gut\" qualitative science class for an easy science credit). I would have liked if the timing of the assignments was better thought out (a lot piled onto the last two weeks) and that we had received grades for the assignments way sooner (at least before the midterm).",
    "Professor Stone is an exceptional lecturer. As mentioned above, keeping the physics intertwined with the greater historical context shed light on aspects of Einstein's work which I don't think would've arose in other contexts, as well as made some of the formulas and theory that much more salient."

    "Yes! 100% recommended, please do TAKE THIS COURSE. It gives such a unique approach to the subject of Physics and it is definitely NOT a gut - problem sets and midterms will both be challenging and rewarding. Physics majors should really consider this as well, even though it is not in the usual track of classes - its extremely rewarding to look at the field from a historical and biographical lens, your mathematical abilities and intuition will be tested and sharpened, and there is much to learn from Einsteins spirit. You will literally get to read through Einsteins papers with the professors guidance, and look at scientific history at the very moment of its making! I looked forward to seminars every week because they were so full both of humour and learning.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This may be the most memorable class I have taken in my time at Yale. Very few students take this class because it requires far more math and physics than any \"gut\" science class, yet is outside the normal track for physics majors, so is stuck in a very awkward place. I think way more physics majors, as well as interested people with enough knowledge of math and some background in physics, should take this course. The history aspect is fascinating and provides a whole new perspective to the breakthroughs that led to quantum mechanics and relativity theory. The class is fun and engaging, and is so personalized that it'll definitely change from year to year. Douglas's book is great as well, and he's just a character that people in the department should definitely meet. If you're a physics major, or at least know math and have some physics background, and you want an elective that is engaging, rigorous, and not super work intensive, while being WAY more fun than a standard physics lecture, consider this class.",
    "Absolutely. The course was engaging, the lectures were well explained and the readings were interesting, relevant and perfectly supplementary, even including the original papers of Einstein.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Stone is an incredible professor who invests a great deal of time in his students. You learn just the right amount of physics to appreciate Einstein's work, and discuss fascinating topics in the history of science. Having had only one semester of physics under my belt before taking this class, Professor Stone worked closely with me and nurtured me into a passable physics students. Each class was beyond enjoyable, and I bonded so well with my peers. Please take this class!"
