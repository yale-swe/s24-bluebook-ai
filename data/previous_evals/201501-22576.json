   "comments": [
    "Excellent introduction. Take this course if you want to read what DS students do, but do not want the same level of commitment.",
    "yes, the works can be boring but Garsten is great and it's a good foundation to have",
    "Lots of writing. Lots and lots of writing. Good books. Unclear writing assignments and uneven grading. Garsten is fine as a lecturer.",
    "Highly recommended if you are looking for an introductory course of this nature! Prof Garsten is an excellent professor. Take it writing-intensive too if you can afford the time; the experience is good!",
    "PLSC 114 is a great introduction to many of the thinkers that make of modern political thought, from Aristotle to Tocqueville.",
    "If you are at all considering taking this class, I would absolutely advise that you do. Professor Garsten is wonderful, the texts are interesting, and I genuinely looked forward to going to lecture each week. Also, the format of the writing intensive sections in which you get a lot of feedback on your writing and how you frame your philosophical arguments will allow you to improve significantly throughout the course of the semester.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it, if you're into this sort of thing. A lot of writing, but it helped me learn more consistently.",
    "Very good. Great books. A lot of reading, but definitely worth it. You will learn a lot in this class.",
    "The volume of reading can be frustrating at times. A lot easier in the non-writing intensive than in the writing-intensive track. Take it if you like the course material, or are interested in a DS-lite type experience.",
    "Unless you did DS, everyone should take this class! Don't leave Yale without reading the classics. They're a canon for a reason.",
    "You should look at the syllabus before this course and make sure you are ready and willing to do all the reading. They get very hard to keep on once the semester gets going and you feel very far behind if you don't do them. If you are motivated to do the work you get a lot more from the course and will ultimately do better.",
    "Great intro class, lots of work but very interesting",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because of its fascinating material.",
    "Yes, most interesting course I took. Political philosophy is fascinating, and Garsten is a great lecturer. Little work if you go non-writing intensive, which I recommend unless you love writing.",
    "It's a great introductory class. After taking it, I'll definitely want to take a more in-depth class on an era or an author.",
    "This class is an introduction to the classic works of political philosophy. It guides students to think through these types of topics through close reading and analyzation of themes across thinkers.",
    "Awesome course with a great reading list. You need to read all of the books, but if you do you won't have trouble with the final exam. It is lots of reading but it is great, you get to read the important parts of the DS reading list. Its a great course for anyone who wanted to be in DS but didn't want their schedule to be so set.",
    "I do not recommend this course. The readings are too long to fully engage with them, unless you have many MANY hours every week to devote to them. I wish shorter, more intentionally assigned readings had been provided. Garsten's teaching style was more conducive with me sleeping then actually learning. I did not enjoy this course. Professor Garsten should have provided some sort of structure or handout to accompany his lectures instead of just speaking for an hour. My section for this course was dry and not engaging -- the students did not speak enough to fill the short 50 minute slot.",
    "Political Philosophy is basically a survey of Directed Studies readings. The canon of Western Philosophy is covered. Professor Garsten keeps the class interesting. The option of earning WR credit should always be taken because its a pretty easy WR credit; I cannot stress how easy it is to earn a WR credit.",
    "It's hard to say. My experience was totally destroyed by my TF, but I really enjoyed going to lectures. Professor Garsten is such a passionate teacher. I'll be on the lookout for classes he teaches in the future. Section was horrible though, and I know I am not the only one in my section who had a bad experience.",
    "Basic intro course. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to all Yalies who missed out on the enriching readings of Directed Studies. The class has a bunch of really diverse readings that strike at the core behind the shallow political discussions of this day and age. The class surprisingly makes a difference in daily decisions and how someone looks at the world. There are good readings, a great professor, and motivated TFs. This is also a great way to get a writing credit without too much work and while engaging with interesting course work.",
    "This is a class students of any major should take! The class readings are things everyone should read, and Garsten is a pretty great lecturer!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to people interested in political thought and the formation of western ideals. Many are probably considering MoFoPo, and from what I've heard, most people enjoyed Political Philosophy more. The only reason I would suggest considering a different course is if you are mostly interested in more modern thinkers. This class dabbles in the 19th century, but there isn't anyone more contemporary than Nietzsche.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student. I would very much compare the class to DS historical and political thought class. This class may be perfect for those who considered DS but didn't want the grind that people often associate with the full DS program.",
    "Definitely take if you are interested in DS type subjects but didn't take DS. Be prepared for tough grading however.",
    "Overall a decent class, but I think it would be better to have taken for a writing credit. It would've been marginally more work, but would have ensured that you kept up on the reading and were thinking about these books on a deeper level. Garsten isn't the most amazing lecturer in my opinion, but he's very passable.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 114 to other kids who want a broad survey of political philosophy. The class doesn't go into too much depth on any single political philosopher, so if you are well read, then maybe you may look at higher level classes which spend considerable time on individual philosophers.",
    "It is literally a mini DS so be cautious of philosophy is not your strong suit but I thought it was an amazing class. You move through the material efficiently and it is interesting. There's not a lot of writing, only two essays and the final if you don't take it for a writing credit so I strongly suggest it.",
    "Lectures really are soothing. Be prepared for boring dense reading. Dont take it WR. Garsten is a great teacher and you have fun.",
    "It's a great class if you want a basic introduction to the major philosophers that shaped modern politics--it gives you a new perspective on human nature.",
    "Take PLSC 114 if you want the chance to read the \"old books\" of philosophy and explore them in greater detail. However, choose your section wisely and be prepared (if you're taking the course writing intensive) to write a lot!",
    "This is a challenging course that skims over many important books surrounding political philosophy. Learning is entirely based on the time you spend, not the time spent sitting in lecture. Writing intensive section is a LOT of writing. I learned a lot about the individual \"thinkers\" but struggled with relating the content of the course to modern life.",
    "It's a great class, you'll learn a lot, and the workload isn't bad at all. QoWs take barely like an hour or two a week, and the writing really does scale, so you never do too much work in any given week. The works are really interesting and Garsten does a great job of breaking them down.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if the fellow student is interested in the theories behind why some types of political systems work in different scenarios. The philosophers that we read all have different views concerning similar areas of politics, which really allows you to assess for yourself and figure out what the best way to rule is. Definitely take the class, as the TA's and professor are also good and valuable resources.",
    "Interesting material. Lot of reading.",
    "I would recommend the course for a student who wants to get a taste of political philosophy.",
    "PLSC 114 is an incredible introduction to Political Philosophy! I would recommend the class to everyone. Professor Garsten's lectures are thoughtfully crafted and filled with ideas for students to contemplate. You come away from the class with a much deeper understanding of how to think. The information we learn in class generates a lot of discussion among students; it's great for after-classes conversations with your friends!",
    "Great class! DOnt take it writing intensive unless you are prepared to be challenged as a writer.",
    "This course was a really great introduction to some important texts which, outside of Directed Studies, students often don't get the chance to engage with. Lectures were fascinating and enlightening, and Professor Garsten really is a fantastic lecturer, one who is approachable, enthusiastic for the material, incredibly knowledgeable, and lively and engaging in lecture. Definitely take advantage of his office hours, it's something I wish I had done more of. Reading could be excessive, but sections were often helpful in picking out the main points in the author's arguments. The structure of the course has changed in that weekly writing assignments are required, which are combined into portfolios and a longer paper later on. It can feel like a bit of a grind at times, but I definitely think it gets you in the habit of writing philosophy papers, which takes time to master. Final was not awful, but do budget time well on the essays and make sure your prep for them is solid. My TA was excellent in both section and helping craft my essays, if a little bit of a harsh grader. Overall, really glad to have taken this course, one of my favorites at Yale thus far.",
    "This course teaches the foundations of political thought. It allows students to read the greatest philosophers in history, such as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, and Rousseau. It isn't easy - but I would recommend the course to any student who loves ideas and takes them seriously.",
    "Having never taken any philosophy before in my life, this class was a great introductory survey. The lectures are great, the readings are interesting, and section is helpful. A word about writing intensive though: IT IS WAY MORE WORK THAN NON-WRITING INTENSIVE. At times, I found myself regretting the decision to take it writing intensive because of how much more work it entailed (I didn't really need the credit...), but at the end of the semester, I felt better prepared for the final compared to my peers and had a better grasp of the material overall.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's an overview of the topics and central works of political philosophy. I really enjoyed doing the writing for the class. Garsten is a great lecturer. He has a very thoughtful style. It can be a lot of work, but it's really worth it.",
    "Garsten lectures well about the texts he assigns, usually placing them in their historical context, discussing the author's life and motivations for writing the work, and finally diving into the content. In this iteration of the course, he focused a lot on relating each work to a struggle to understand modernity, which served well to run a common analytical thread through the whole syllabus. The strength of this course is section. My section leader was amazing and we covered a lot in section. And it was actually fun to attend section and discuss these thinkers. I think the class is a great way to get your feet wet in political philosophy. We deal with the questions the course asks and attempts to answer on a daily basis, but we don't always realize it. This course will definitely make you a more critical thinker if you are willing to invest into reading the works.",
    "PLSC 114 is a lot of reading, but well worth the time and effort. It covers a good range of texts and makes them accessible to even a non-polisci major.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I think the lectures were amazing and my TF was amazing as well. It was a lot of work but totally worth it.",
    "A great course to take if you're interested in politics, great thinkers, or if you're just looking for a class with an excellent reading list.",
    "PLSC 114 is a great class to take! If you are interested in philosophy and want a light survey approach, then this is for you! This class is also one of the easier and more helpful writing credits for developing your writing abilities. You write a lot, but because of the weekly writings, you always have a foundation for later, longer papers. You are never told to write a 4-6 page paper without having SOMETHING to work off of and that's where the strength of this class lies. Professor Garsten is also very brilliant and has a very soothing voice (which could be god or bad if you have problems with falling asleep when listening to philosophical lectures...) Otherwise, I HIGHLY recoomend this class!!!"
