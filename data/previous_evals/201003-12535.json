    "take it.",
    "This class is great. Chinese is hard, and the class is fast-paced, but you learn a lot. I would recommend studying it with a friend: a friend and I [tried]to practice making sentences by ourselves outside of class. It really helped.",
    "Chinese 132 02 is an intense, intermediate Chinese language course under the 'heritage' track intended for students with Chinese backgrounds. I would recommend it highly to a student who fits this description and is self-motivated to learn and improve his\/her Chinese.",
    "Great class but very little class participation because there's so much material covered in such a short amount of time.",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested in improving the reading and writing part of Chinese.",
    "It's a pretty good course, and will really help you improve your Chinese. Homework is slightly on the heavy side, but it's not too difficult, and it's reasonable considering it's 1.5 credits. She tells you everything that will be on the exam, so her tests are really fair even though they occur once every two and a half weeks.",
    "It's a great class for native speakers who have a pretty good grasp of reading\/writing but aren't ready for full out essays or advanced voacb. Absolutely take it, even if you don't need the language credit - it's fun and I really learned a lot.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to another student. Your Chinese will improve very quickly."
