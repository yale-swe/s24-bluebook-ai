   "comments": [
    "very solid intro political science class, take this instead of intro to american politics, not too much reading, as much work as you want (can take it regularly, WR, or with a large research paper, your choice), but still very good lectures",
    "Very easy, but you do need to know the authors' names and theories before the exams.",
    "NO DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS YOU LEARN NOTHING VALUABLE AND ITS A WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT, ESPECIALLY AS A WRITING CREDIT",
    "PLSC 226 is a solid political science course that I wouldrecommend to any other major or person invested in learning about the US election system. The readings are very interesting and Professor Mayhew is at the top of the field. I would especially recommend the writing section - two 8-12 page papers is very reasonable, and you learn a lot throughout the writing process. The lectures are not overly stimulating or helpful, but the material in the class is important enough that it's worth sitting through it.",
    "This is a great course to take as a writing credit because then you can go to lecture and listen to the interesting things Mayhew has to say without getting caught up in details or having to study. If you need a writing credit and are mildly interested in polysci, its easy. Weekly readings are usually not too taxing either.",
    "Not unless you plan on running stats or being a campaign manager.... for a person interested in the people aspect of politics this is NOT for you.... votes are made into numbers and most of the class is based on theories and their contradictions",
    "Tough to say. I took WR-intensive. A totally different experience (revolves almost entirely around TF and section) than the lecture.",
    "Awesome material, easy writing credit",
    "This class is a boring study of parties elections and policy. I would not recommend it to another student. Although there isn't that much work, the class is really boring and complicated at times, for no reason. Don't take it. Not educational and boring.",
    "I do not recommend this class. The first few lectures and readings are very interesting but they become very technical and confusing as the semester continues. Mayhew is not an engaging lecturer and section is hit or miss. The reading load is not too hard but the exam questions cover details rather than the significant themes of the course.",
    "Take this if you need a WR credit! Only two 8-12 page papers the entire semester - no finals or exams. Course material is also very applicable to present and interesting. You don't need to go to lecture really if you are taking it WR (just do the readings, which are actually very manageable each week).",
    "I would not recommend this class. It was ridiculously boring. Don't let the appeal of David Mayhew lure you into this class, he is a really boring professor and his reputation stems from his scholarship, not from his teaching ability.",
    "Super interesting if you're interested in U.S. politics, reading is manageable, and discussions in section were awesome. Lectures are a little unstructured, but if you like American politics, you should definitely take this class.",
    "Poli Sci 226 is an excellent gut class, especially if you take the WR section. You do not have to go to class, or do the reading, as it's basically all common sense and basic American political knowledge. If you actually want to learn something, take Mayhew's seminar instead.",
    "Very nice intro course to political parties",
    "Overview of the history and characteristics of political parties in America, how those characteristics affect what and how policies are made, and also an overview of the mechanisms behind political elections (like midterm sag, honeymoon phase, etc.).",
    "Only take this class if you're a) interested in the readings and b) actually plan to do them. The lectures are dreadful; they're a complete waste of time. But you can still get something out of the class by just doing the readings.Obviously, the WR sections are much better deals than the non-WR sections.",
    "Yes- not too difficult and an interesting look at the patterns in american elections and policymaking- a good intro type american history course.",
    "Great class. Talk to the TFs before committing to a section, though.",
    "recommended for anyone who is interested in US politics, and definitely if you need a writing credit!",
    "This is a terrific writing credit. You only have to write two 8-12 page papers. Also, because you only use the books on the syllabus for the papers, you never have to go to lecture or do any substantial research.",
    "This class was great if you are interested in the field. I would not recommend this class to any student who is not in the major or genuinely interested in the material. The readings are steep and sometimes hard to follow. Mayhew is great and he is on of the leading political scientists today so it is cool to read his material and see how many other authors also cite his work. I took this class as a writing credit and we wrote 2 papers which were both worth 50% of our grade. The TA you get is very important because he or she can really make or break your experience with the class. I for example, dreaded going to section more than anything, and although I enjoyed the lectures, I was really discouraged based on my TA and the section discussions. Our TA belittled us for not knowing as much as her, she was very combative and definitely made our discussions tense because no one wanted to voice their opinion and get shut down when she didn't agree. Overall I enjoyed Professor Mayhew, but again, I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are going to enjoy the material.",
    "Take the WR section, it's a much easier route if writing a 10 page paper isn't misery for you.",
    "No...DO NOT take this class. Lectures and readings are so boring.",
    "The course teaches a new and interesting take on partisan politics, and for the most part it was very engaging. It was also a privilege to have such a knowledgable professor on the topic. It's a good class for a writing credit, but be aware that non-political science majors (or those with limited knowledge of the subject) will of course be at a disadvantage.",
    "This is a beginning course for people who want to pursue the Political Science major. It is a very valuable course to take and if one goes into into with the proper attitude one will be successful."
