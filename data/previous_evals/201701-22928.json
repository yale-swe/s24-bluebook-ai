   "comments": [
    "I recommend using a textbook different from Kardar's book. It's very terse, so one might gain only a superficial understanding of the course content from that book alone. Additionally, the book's index is abysmal. The book problems were sometimes straightforward enough, and sometimes unclear. However, the problems that Professor Reed gave from outside the book were good.",
    "I think the course could be improved by adding more examples and keeping the bigger picture in mind as to connect the different subjects covered. Most of the course everything is very generalized, which is important especially for the mathematical analysis and methods used, but students can be lost in the details.",
    "clear introduction to the basic formulation of stat physics could relate the theoretical formulation with more real physical systems",
    "HW problems that the professor wrote were more insightful that the textbook problems. The exams reflected the course material well.",
    "Strengths - organized lectures and homework",
    "The last month of material was presented in a very rushed manner and was difficult to understand, while being some of the most interesting material in the course. One weakness is that a larger proportion of the midterm than expected was on math methods material (approximations) that we were not expecting to be tested on. Otherwise, the material assigned was very fair.",
    "Strength: We learned the material from a general, more mathematical approach. Weakness: The concepts occasionally became too abstract. This course could benefit from more physical examples"

    "It's required.",
    "I would recommend this course only to students very interested in the topic or where it is needed for their work. Have to come with a strong math and physics background to understand the content and not be distracted by technicalities of derivations etc.",
    "It was my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "Yes, this is a good course for building on stat mech and thermo someone might have learned in undergrad."
