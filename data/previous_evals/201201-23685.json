   "comments": [
    "It might be better to exclude course auditors and undergraduates in the class in the future. It diminishes the cohesiveness of the group. I understand the potential benefits, but I think it would just work better to have all grad students who are enrolled in the course.While very trivial, the actual classroom was not conducive to such a large class that met for 3 hours. It would be nice to have a bigger room next year.",
    "Would be better to start working on projects as soon as possible- we didn't divide up in earnest until late Jan-Feb. The background info on Haiti was very helpful, but much of that could have been readings done over Christmas break, so that we would have arrived in January prepped and ready - maybe one more class of Haiti background info, then straight into our projects.",
    "Apart from the trip, the class itself should be substantially refined. I imagine that it could go one of two ways:1. It becomes more of a student-led independent study class where students clearly understand that the knowledge, experience, and project that they get out of the class is entirely up to them.OR2. It becomes a much more structured exploration of sustainable development challenges and practices, and the projects have a strong project management leadership and guidance.As it is now, the class feels quite disorganized and thrown together.",
    "There should be more discourse about development theory. There are many faculty at Yale in the Global Affairs and Political Science departments among others who could devote one class our to discussing development as a concept. Reading regarding Haiti's history and present should be assigned over break. The presentation during the first lecture should not be the first time that students learn of the U.S. occupation of Haiti or Toussiant L'Ouverture or voodoo. The Creole class should be offered bootcamp style before the trip. It wasn't regular enough to be effective and instead a certain block of time should be devoted to learning the language in the two weeks before the trip. Bob was a great presence in our class but the irregularity of the Wednesday lessons wasn't efficient.",
    "The curriculum. Either a more guided curriculum on the history of Haiti and development theory or an expectation of more independent study.",
    "I think that the professors could revisit the curriculum and either focus more on the theory aspect, by adding more structure to the reading\/discussion\/research\/writing components of the course, or the practice aspect, by meeting less often as a large group and doing more small-group independent work.",
    "It will be much better if you can invite more expertise in the area of planning and evaluation of projects so that we can learn how we can design our project and evaluate it after the field trip.",
    "More options for types of projects.",
    "A quicker start, things will improve year by year I'm sure."

    "Aligned with my interests. Heard about it when I was still considering programs a year ago, and have been wanting to take it since.",

    "This course seemed like a unique opportunity to engage in practical learning and to work with students from outside my department, who approach sustainable development from different perspectives.",

An advantage and disadvantage was myself and another group member had vastly different opinions on things which sometimes made things tense but at the same time, both of our approaches were beneficial to the overall project so I think it was a good experience in compromising for both of us.",
    "Learned a lot from the members in my group - brought different experiences and perspectives. Personality challenges can be a disadvantage.",
    "Common advantages and disadvantages apply here. Some group members did more work than others. I wondered if smaller groups of 2-3 would have be better.",
    "Advantages- sharing of skills and talents",
    "I really enjoyed working with my group on our project. This was probably the most rewarding aspect of the course.",
