   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. It's an interesting class that's relatively stress-free. Although I'm not considering the major, I think it would be helpful for deciding whether you want to be a CogSci major.",
    "I would recommend it. I would say it is an interesting, fun class that introduces scientific methods of thinking about the brain and the mind, along with an overview of some ofthe information that these methodologies have uncovered.",
    "big lecture. 2 exams (hard and tough grading--he says he doesn't like to give tests or assessments, but his exams indicate otherwise). 2-4 reading responses on long (sometimes dense) readings. 5-7 page paper.. literally no prompt, completely open ended... write about anything is cogsci. lectures are semi-interesting. brian scholl is funny, but sometimes tries a little too hard. disorganized slides (difficult to use for studying). rambles a lot. would recommend as a cr\/d.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. it's superb!",
    "Take it. It's fun. And you'll learn a lot.",
    "Take it if you have an interest in the topic, but do not take it just for fun.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. The material is fascinating as it has to do with human nature, the ways we perceive the world, and the ways our mind works and doesn't work. The workload is fair (on the easy side, actually), the tests are based on lecture questions, and the professor is awesome. I had a lot of fun in this class, as did my classmates, judging by the moments when we would all gasp or mutter in surprise (or sometimes giggle nervously) at some revelation provided by lecture. Learn about yourself, others, your relationship to the world, and have fun doing it.",
    "An incredible class. I highly recommend it for both potential majors and non-majors alike. The lectures were, without fail, interesting and engaging -- when class was canceled for the hurricane, I was genuinely upset. If you are worried about workload, then don't worry. The class isn't incredibly work-heavy or filled with busy work. There is no textbook. One or two reading responses are due before each class and a final paper, which requires only thought (no research).",
    "Take this class if you are considering a CogSci major. It can change your opinions for better or for worse. Sometimes there is a lack of integration regarding the myriad of topics covered by the course. Consider taking a PSYCH course instead if you have the option.",
    "YES! This was definitely my favorite class this year. All of the topics covered are fascinating, and class moves along so that you'll never get bored. A few warnings though: you MUST go to every class (there's no textbook and the PPT's are basically opaque if you didn't listen to the lecture) and the tests are fairly tricky.",
    "As a senior, I took this class on the recommendation, and it's the best class I have ever taken here at Yale. The main lessons are cognitive blindess (how it is easy to overlook the complexities behind instincts, perceptions, and actions the come easily to us, such as language, seeing in the 3-dimensions, decision-making, and love). I think this knowledge is necessary in other fields (and many philosophy classes are outdated because they ignore this information) and intersects a lot with most others (econ, anthro, global affairs, comp sci). It's the most universally applicable knowledge I've learned in a class, but also will help you understand your own instincts better, and teach you which instinctual \"broken correlations\" that evolved over evolutionary time, that you should avoid when looking for love.",
    "Take it if you're interested. If you've taken a lot of upper-level psych or cogsci courses before, this class will get repetitive and be kind of dull. Also, though I generally like him, Brian Scholl tends to present controversial and inconclusive theories as fact, and would do better to highlight the complexities of his theories, rather than just assert them as 100% true. Study for the tests. It's exactly what you'd expect from a decent intro course.",
    "If you are looking for an in depth class about the brain, this is not the one for you. This class is more a survey of methods used to study the brain, aspects of the brain that can be investigated, and case studies of research done in the field. This class definitely strengthens your ability to read and digest scientific papers (as these are the only readings), and the lectures are engaging. However, I wouldn't recommend this class to another student because your time could be better spent elsewhere. Take intro psych or brain and thought and have a more comprehensive, in depth class.",
    "Shop it.",
    "I would recommend cognitive science 110 to anyone even remotely interested in how the mind works, regardless of whether or not they want to major in it. It is just a really cool survey of all the study happening with the human mind.",
    "Strangely, I think this class might be better for someone who wants an easy and fun 5th class than someone who's actually serious about cog sci or psych. But if you're interested in cog sci major you have to take it anyway so. It's a pretty fun class and the material is interesting, but you come out of it feeling like you haven't learned much beyond \"cog sci is cool!\" and a couple general themes that get shoved down your throat. I also found the tests grading really strange and unpredictable. I think it's because he's usually looking for some specific word or phrase in your answers. Scholl is very organized and enthusiastic and tries to be funny, but the class just seemed a little scattered to me. Cool material though.",
    "Cog Sci 110 is a great class! It's pretty easy, with a new topic pretty much every single class, and it's a great overview to many aspects of Cog Sci! It's also very interesting, and it's a very straightforwardly simple class. Not too difficult to keep up in!",
    "Yes! I took it as a fifth class and it was great. Not too much work, plus (most) lectures are super interesting and a lot of fun.",
    "Cog Sci is a whirlwind tour through some subfields of cognitive science. Practically every lecture is something completely new, which is fun, and not as disorienting as you would imagine. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, with the caveat that you are not going to go in depth in any one subject, which can be a bit frustrating, but it might inspire you to take other related classes.",
    "This is an awesome class that shows you many aspects of the human mind and gives you a good overview of the methods and main themes of cognitive science. Since there is no textbook for the class, not only will you save money, but you'll also get to read only the most interesting stuff, cherry-picked by Prof. Scholl. Amusing, always in a good mood, loving father, and passionate about his field, he will always make sure to keep you engaged and share some of his enthusiasm for cognitive science with you. Although he will be more passionate when talking about his own specialization (visual perception), he does a good job in ensuring that every aspect of cognitive science receives its fair share of attention and awesomeness. The two midterms are not necessarily hard, but rather tricky; but as long as you pay attention in class, do your readings and study beforehand, you should do just fine. I would recommend this class to absolutely everybody I know and don't know, simply because it tells you so much about how your mind really works and Prof. Scholl makes the whole trip much more pleasurable.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 provides a thorough overview of the field of cognitive science (which includes linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, and biology, among others). It's an interesting course in general, and you should definitely take it if you are considering the cognitive science major. It gives you a sense of current experiments, where the research is at right now, and what we can learn with cognitive science. I would recommend it to anyone considering the major or anyone interested in learning how the mind works from a non-psychological point of view.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Intro to CogSci to any other student interested in learning about how the mind works and operates. The class highlights all of the interesting actions that our minds do that we take for granted and demonstrates how complex these actions really are. You don't have to be a CogSci major to appreciate the class for everyone has a mind and the class helps you appreciate all of the things that it does for you.",
    "it is so interesting! i never knew that i would marry my future wife purely because of her symmetrical face and full lips, which indicate good health and fertility. even though i failed everything in this class, i still think it is quite the valuable experience. regardless of one's career path, there is always something to be learned in this course!",
    "1. Brian Scholl delivers great lectures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he is eloquent and witty.2. This course provides a nice sampling of a lot of different fields, including linguistics, perception, development, and neuroscience. Take it if you're interested in these areas but all you want is a nice short overview.3. Readings were tough at first as they all come from the primary scientific literature, but stick with it and you'll findit quite rewarding.4. Fantastic guest lectures!5. This course turned out to be a nice complement to PSYC 110. Whatever overlap they had was reinforcing rather than redundant. CGSC 110 tended to present a more rigorous and scholarly approach whereas PSYC 110 presented the information in a way that was perhaps more palatable to a general audience. Both approaches are valuable in their own respects.",
    "Its an interesting class with a lot of fun facts. I would recommend the class--you learn a lot and it isn't very difficult or a lot of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a fascinating introduction to the most interesting subject out there: the mind. The teaching is amazing and the lectures were always very enjoyable. It is not very difficult, and I feel like I learned a lot of things that I can apply in my everyday life.",
    "It covers a wide array of topics within the CogSci field, so the course seemed to lack cohesion at times. But the workload is very manageable, the exams are a breeze (only multiple-choice and short-answer), and the content is really fascinating. Also, Prof. Scholl is a great professor, very funny and engaging.",
    "It is a pretty standard survey of parts of the field of cognitive science. As Professor Scholl says in class, the field is huge and so he could have talked about completely different subjects so when you go in expect to learn a bunch of interesting stuff, but it is by no means the entire field. rather you understand how cognitive science is connected by certain recurrent themes and methodologies which is an interesting perspective to take. I would recommend it for any social science majors. The exams are quite fair, although tricky at times and the expectations for the classa re quite reasonable. However, if you are a humanities brain I would maybe stay away from it as it can get technical at times.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Not only are the lectures are intellectually stimulating, but I also think I belly-laughed in every single one.",
    "Only take it if you are absolutely 100% positively steadfast in your love for CogSci. Otherwise you will lose interest. Scholl is a funny guy. The curve is rough, so make sure you LOVE the material before you commit to anything.",
    "This was a fun class, in which you learn about various techniques of examining the mind. I definitely learned some cool stuff in this class--in particular, I realized that a lot of the things we take for granted are actually very difficult to explain. This class is worth taking.",
    "CogSci 110 is like learning about all the awesome weird things that you used to think about and gave up on because you couldn't think of an answer. Plus some. Whether you are planning on majoring in CogSci or not, this course is definitely one you should still take. It is interesting, applicable to nearly all fields of study, you think about it all the time, it's real life, and you just get a better understanding of what and why people do what they do. I would ask them: why are you reading this? Just take the class.",
    "This class is really basic and redundant, especially if you know anything about cogsci\/psych already coming into it...take something else if you can.",
    "At times, it can be confusing as to why you are learning what you are learning and it can be overwhelming the amount and breadth of information. However, the material always seems to come together right before the exams, and Professor Scholl's exams were always fairly written and fairly graded. Don't get frustrated if the class seems difficult at times, it all works out in the end.",
    "Yes, take this class! It is fun, not too much work. You will enjoy it as the Professor is very good, and the studied material very interesting.",
    "Only if you have the time and if you're sure that you will like Cog Sci. If you're ambivalent then the class will be dreadful",
    "This is an overview class, and should be taken if people are interested in psychology and haven't yet given a thought to whether or not they would be interested in cognitive science.",
    "pretty good class overall, some overlap with psyc 110. much less in depth compared to psyc though--more manageable amount to study. has some parts that are a bit dry, eg technicalities of linguistics--make sure to look over syllabus and shop the class. not all lectures are as fun as the first few!",
    "Take it if you're interested in how the mind works...exams can get pretty specific, but it's a great example of an intro course done right.",
    "If you're taking this class just for fun, it's fun, but I might recommend a smaller, more focused class. At the end of the class, you realize that you don't really know that much, just general things that you can't explain that well. As is customary of any intro course really. But i was happy with it.In summary: things i rememberturing machinesinstinct blindnessinattentional blindnessperceptioncoincidence avoidancewolf-pack effect",
    "Cognitive Science 110 is a great introduction the field, and if Professor Scholl is teaching the class, most definitely take it, he makes the class very interesting. The reading amount isn't too bad, and overall, the class is very manageable.",
    "It's interesting, but not easy. Don't get lulled into a false sense of security by the few pass\/fail reading responses and one paper you have to write - the midterm and final are comprehensive, so you'll need to study well. Overall, lectures were really great and the readings engaging. I would recommend this to anyone interested in psychology, or just looking for a good social science credit.",
    "CogSci 110 is a great introduction to cogsci and a great social science course. It covers a wide range of topics so you can get a sense of which topics or disciplines are more engaging for you, i.e. neuroscience or computer science. I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in the social sciences because it is interesting, expansive, and a very manageable amount of work.",
    "CogSci is definitely challenging, especially if you've had very little science background, like me. However, if you at ten every lecture and do the readings, you'll learn a lot and probably do fine on assignments and exams. It is much less similar to psychology than expected.",
    "-yes its quite interesting",
    "Easy 5th credit. Lecture is interesting enough, and the weekly reading responses make it easy to keep up with it.",
    "Download the slides and take notes on the slides, or you'll waste time writing things down. The lectures are THE MOST important part about this course. For every lecture you really focus on and pay attention to, you will probably grasp the concepts perfectly and not have a hard time studying. If you miss a lecture of miss parts of what he's saying (not just what's on the slides), you're really in trouble because none of the work can be done at home. Go to class! And be happy you don't have a ton of work outside of the class. Super manageable yet not a gut class at all. Loved it.",
    "Take it, even if you have taken Intro to Psych. There is a bit of overlap in materials, but no more than 20% at best. This is a fascinating class, and you will learn all about how much there is left to find out about the human mind.",
    "Into Cog Sci is a decent course, especially if you're interested in how people think and how the mind works. There is a decent amount of work including reading responses for each lecture and a paper that's slightly difficult to write. Professor Scholl can be slightly off-putting in lectures, make sure that you like his style before taking the class. Overall, the material isn't too difficult, but the workload is significant.",
    "An introduction to some recent and influential research on how exactly the brain interacts with the world. This field is flourishing, and as a newer science (due to the advent of the fMRI and other imaging techniques) offers several opportunities for you to explore particular interests",
    "I would definitely recommend Cognitive Science, even if you consider yourself a humanities student. The material is very fascinating, and you learn a great deal about what makes you a fully-functioning human being. With a broad array of topics like visual perception, language acquisition, infant cognition, linguistics, morality, and many others, you're bound to learn a whole host of interesting things, and you'll come out of the course feeling like you understand a lot more about how you think. Plus, Brian Scholl is a hilarious, engaging instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0094you shouldn't pass up the chance to take a class with him.",
    "This is a sweet class. You are graded on a midterm, a final, a paper, and your homework. Homework is reading and a reading response. The readings can take a long long time, (upwards of 40 dense pages). Most of the material covered in the tests are things the professor covers in class. I recommend you print out the slides before class and take notes directly on them by hand. When reviewing for the exam, copy your notes down into a word document and print it out and memorize.This is a sweet class. If you take it you'll understand how optical illusions work, and why they work.",
    "Typical survey course. You'll be introduced to a range of interdisciplinary concepts, some more interesting than others. Scholl is really charismatic and mostly engaging during lecture, so the class was a pleasure. You'll have daily readings responses but they're not strenuous and you can't get a bad grade on them unless you don't submit them. Took this because I tested out of Intro Psych, but from what I heard, this somehow seemed less interesting than the psych class.",
    "Professor Scholl was funny and the material at the end was worth the few weeks on linguistics. The readings were good, but download the lecture slides the night before lecture. Don't poo-poo this class before the midterm, because it will be harder than you expect, and graded more harshly than you expect.",
    "Low work class that covers some very interesting topics. I was expecting it to be more Psychology based but it was much more about the mechanics of the mind, if your into that kind of thing.",
    "If you are truly passionate and interested in the workings of the mind, and wouldn't mind reading lengthy papers and journal s about this subject, definitely take the course. You will learn a lot, and it offers a good foundation on research opportunities in the field.",
    "Gives a useful window into the research of the field. I'd suggest it as an alternative to psychology for someone interested in how the human mind works but less excited by topics covered in a psych course like mental disorders, Freud's ideas, etc. Also, a good complement to an intro computer science course since Intro to CogSci considers computation to be a central concept and explores a lot of things like language and visual perception from that perspective (though of course no knowledge of programming or computers is expected or required).",
    "Definitely if you have any interest in cogsci or psychology",
    "Indifferent. I thought a few of the things I learned were really fascinating: visual perception, linguistics, comparative cognition. But otherwise, some of the material felt like Scholl just preaching to us about how cool it was, when it really wasn't that interesting: modularity, instinct blindness. The material in the first half of the course is much less exciting than the second half of the course.",
    "As a senior psychology major with several cogsci courses under my belt, I kind of expected to be bored in this class. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not generally the case (at least, not for the first half of the course). Brian's lectures were entertaining, and the readings were often fairly interesting (though I can imagine that if you didn't have any psychology\/cogsci background, the many scientific papers we read could be more confusing than enlightening). That said, if you're a psych major and the kind of person who is driven nuts by hearing stuff you've heard before, you might want to give this a pass, because there will inevitably be some overlap with your other courses.",
    "Unless you have to take it as a prerequisite I would just take it credit\/D",
    "CGSC 110 is a fantastic course if you are interested in cognitive science and looking for a class that is not too demanding. The course load is pretty light, and you can learn some very interesting stuff.",
    "I would recommend the CogSci 110. Go to lectures, they're interesting and most of the exam material comes from them anyway. Well-taught and well-organized course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it's a very interesting and new way to study a common subject. The professor is funny and picks relevant readings for his class.",
    "I would say: \"Bro, you really got to take this class. It's so clutch, this class. I mean, you learn so much intellectual knowledge, dude.\" For real though, this class is the absolute best. I would take this class again every semester, and it would be the only class I take. It is so good that I videotape every lecture and watch all of them before I go to sleep every night. And also when I wake up every morning. I just like watching Brian Scholl do his thang on the stage. The spotlight hits him just perfectly. I also have audio so I can listen to him while I shower.",
    "Good overview of a bunch of different fields like linguistics, psychology, computer science, human development. Might be good to take earlier on so if you really like a certain topic you can take more classes in that area.The professor tries to make lecture engaging and interactive, so that was fun, though some topics are a bit more dull than the others. The class wasn't too much work - two exams, which I thought were fair, and a short paper. Plus reading responses - but the readings aren't too long and usually you don't have to read in too much detail to get the gist.",
    "Cognitive Science 110 suffers from the same problem as any broad intro course: a lot of interesting material is covered, but none of it is in any depth. This is especially a problem in Cog Sci, which is a such a broad field that it can takesome effort to see the connections between the topics of the different lectures.That said, the lectures individually all cover interesting stuff--I noticed that the material from this class came up more often in everyday conversation than in any other class I took.I'd definitely recommend it to a student already interested in cognitive science, but less wholeheartedly to someone who's just curious.",
    "It's a great class for anyone who has ever been interested in psych\/neuro\/philosophy\/has ever thought about the mind - I would recommend it to anyone looking for a course that is both fun while still academically engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants a solid overview of cognitive science. Be careful because the material definitely can overlap with other psychology classes (Sex, Love, and Attraction; Mental Lives of Babies and Animals; probably more), which might be taken as either a positive or a negative. Scholl knows what he's doing since he has taughtthe class a few times. Reading questions can feel a little unhelpful (work just for the sake of work), but they do help your grade out significantly. I struggled a bit with the final paper, in which you must address how a concept from the course does (or doesn't) apply to the real world - seems easy, but writing eight pages on it is harder than you'd think!",
    "Yes. I found this course to be the most fascinating course yet. The breadth of subject matter is wide,so saying \"I'm not a science person\", or \"I'm not a humanities person\" won't apply because Cognitive Science is probably one of the most interdisciplinary topic matters and will require strong skills in both topics. The intersection is necessary and in my opinion makes the course extremely strong. The course isn't particularly difficult if you attend class and do the readings. Brian Scholl, although extremely busy, is a great lecturer and his most important objective is conveying the information in an easy to understand manner -- which he succeeds at. Take it if you can. I personally found it fit my personality more than Intro to Psych and despite the fact that people say the courses are the same, they are in fact quite different.",
    "If you are interested in an introduction of how the human mind works, this is the class! It is as deep as an intro class can get (the reading assignments are scientific papers that were released in the last 25 years) and you learn so much about yourself in a really short time. If you are more interested in the social aspect of humans, then I think Intro to Psychology (PSYC 110) would fit better.",
    "Psychology 130 is a study of the various aspects of cognition. It focuses on the mind but has applications in many different subjects, ranging from linguistics to robotics. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, if only because it was a joy to go to every lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any underclassman who might be at all interested in Cognitive Science or Psychology. Don't wait until you're an upperclassman to take this unless you have to. It might make you want to be a cogsci major.",
    "Not a gut but definitely not rocket science. Really interesting coverage of a variety of topics. Good part is it doesn't get bogged down in that god forsaken computer lingo that happened the other time I tried to take this course a couple of years back. Do the readings (or the main ideas of the readings), answer the reading question, go to class and take notes. Study those notes. Take the 2 exams. Write the 6 page paper (it's basically literally your critique\/commentary of some field in cog sci so it's not like you even have to research anything). Put in a decent amount of effort and you definitely get rewarded for it.",
    "This course is a broad introductory course, which has its positives and negatives. The negatives mostly involve not having time to go greatly in-depth on a variety of topics, as well as having to focus on more topics which may not personally interest you than in a more focused class. I found, however, that the benefits greatly outweighed the costs. Even though the course does skim over a variety of topics, there is also time to hone in on certain concepts which are particularly important and interesting; moreover, because it was so broad in focus, I found myself realizing that I was interested in subject areas I had never considered before. Professor Scholl is a really interesting lecturer, the readings are much more engaging than in a plain textbook, and the course in general covered truly exciting material. Take this course!",
    "Intro to CogSci is an awesome class to take if you want to understand more about how the mind works. It's much more interdisciplinary than a psychology class; you will learn things that stick with you and change the way you think about things. The readings can at times be very complex, but the lecture does a good job of clearing things up. The workload is also very minimal.",
    "Intro to CogSci is a great course, no matter your standing at Yale. Study hard, and you will do well, and perhaps even learn something with societal relevance along the way.",
    "Yes take it! But don't expect it to be easy.",
    "Yes. I wish everyone knew what we learn in Intro Cog Sci. I think it has a broad range of applications to a lot of other classes you might take\u00e2\u0080\u0093 foreign language (you learn how your brain acquires language), econ (you learn about decision-making), literature (the class might help you see literary characters in a different light), political science and history (you learn how we don't always know why we have moral beliefs). I wish every class about people at least looked somewhat at cognitive science.",
    "If you're considering it, definitely take intro Cog Sci. It's been one of the most interesting courses I've taken at Yale, and there are very few bad things to say about it. The material is fascinating and explores many of the different themes and disciplines that make up Cog Sci, including neuroscience, social psychology, computer science, visual processing, even philosophy. Professor Scholl is a fantastic lecturer who is enthusiastic about all of these topics and makes it hard not to be yourself. Evaluations include one midterm, one in class final (your better score from the two will be weighted more heavily), one 6 page paper, and reading responses due every class that are graded as pass\/fail. The exams are fair and the paper is enjoyable to right as the topic is of your own choosing. The one drawback is the reading responses. The readings are pretty long and have almost no effect on your grade except for the reading response completion grade, and one or two questions on the exams, so doing them really seems pointless and becomes a chore.",
    "This class is a great intro to Cognitive Science. If you do not know what that is, that is ok. It is about the brain and how we know about it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. It is not a cake walk by any means but you learn so much that you'd be foolish not to take it.",
    "A very interesting survey of many aspects of Cognitive Science. As someone who took AP Psych in high school, I would still recommend this course. Although there are many similarities, it's just different enough with the material and readings (all the readings are articles - not out of a textbook) to make it worth taking even if you've placed out of Psych 110. Not an especially difficult course if you put in the work. Around half the students get A's \/ A-'s. Scholl is a good lecturer.",
    "A great introduction to Cog Sci. It was in-depth, but covered many different topics. The lectures and readings were engaging. The tests were tricky.",
    "It is a survey course, as it states in the course description. I would just add that it surveys very recent cognitive science findings, some of which make you reevaluate the line between science and science fiction. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, provided that he\/she has not taken Intro Psychology already.",
    "Great lecture class! The material is SO relevant. SO relevant. Take it.",
    "I would really suggest this class as an alternative to Intro Psych. It is a slightly smaller learning environment and all of the material presented is really interesting. I would suggest taking this class just as a general baseline class for Distribution Requirements, but it also may excite you as a new, relatively unknown field as it did for me.",
    "well you gotta if you're cogsci major. but overall, yes. It's really informative about how our brain works.",
    "CogSci ended up becoming one of those classes that I was always excited to talk about. Whenever there was a lull in dining hall conversation or I was on the phone with friends, I would find myself saying, \"So in CogSci the other day, I learned this super interesting thing...\" This field is novel and exciting, and reading about all the cutting-edge research being conducted is nothing short of inspiring. I do have a few problems with how the material was presented - it is largely surface-skimming, and Prof. Scholl tends to be a bit verbose and confusing - but overall, I found it to be an enjoyable course. I did have to spend a considerable amount of time after each lecture deciphering the notes I frantically took to keep up with the professor's lightning-quick words. But I would say that every lecture introduced me to something new and intriguing that made me want to explore all the different disciplines that made up cognitive science more in depth. A good introduction to an exciting field!",
    "The class itself is difficult to summarize but I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",
    "TAKE NOTES ON EVERYTHING. Some of the test questions are so nit-picky it's impossible to prepare correctly unless your notes are incredibly thorough.",
    "I would recommend this class. The tests are tricky, yet the weekly reading responses and final essay work to boost your final grade. I feel as if I have learned a lot, not only from lectures, but also from the assigned articles we were asked to read for the course. The work load was very manageable and though the class was large, the TAs were wonderful in clarifying confusingmaterial and in making the class seem smaller in size.",
    "I debated on whether or not to take Intro to Cog Sci or Intro to Psych but chose Cog Sci because it was more inter-disciplinary and would therefore cover more topics on approaches to studying the human brain. A lot of the topics were kind of boring in my opinion (Linguistics and visual perception) but pretty interesting nonetheless. The ones that did interest me, I will most likely take another course in them. I think this is an excellent course to take for someone who is interested in studying the mind\/ human behavior, but isn't sure which field to branch out in.",
    "It's broad but intensely interesting and applicable. I would really recommend this class if you have any interest in the material at all because it will let you know if you should continue taking classes in cognitive science (or psych or linguistics or neurobiology or any of the other related fields). I would totally recommend this class!",
    "Intro CogSci is great! It's incredibly interesting and it's fascinating how it uses methods from so many different disciplines. The guest lectures were fantastic, and Brian Scholl is an engaging teacher and explains concepts very well. Definitely take it if you are at all interested. It inspired me to apply for the major, which is a credit to Brian Scholl. I did not find that it overlapped with Intro Psych to any sort of annoying extent - just a little material here and there, which more than anything else was helpful to not have to learn a few basic concepts for the first time.",
    "If you're looking for a big gut, don't take this class. If you're looking for something moderately challenging and interesting, take this class. But in order for it to be interesting, you have to pay attention, otherwise everything piles up.",
    "take it if you have to or if you're interested. not much work so you can't really lose",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any other student. Even students who do not plan to major in a related subject will find something here. The material discussed in this class applies to everyone and is endlessly interesting. The topics discussed were things I found myself discussing with friends outside of class.",
    "It was a very interesting class. I would recommend it.",
    "Cogsci is a good class. You learn a lot of odd interesting things about the mind. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone with at least a small interest in the brain.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone without a background cog sci who wants to learn cool things about how our brain works. The reading is really interesting and the workload is not bad.",
    "It was definitely an interesting class--that said, I have a hard time synthesizing what I learned and walked away with.",
    "Totally. The lectures are awesome. Brian Scholl is the man. This is a broad introduction to topics from neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and computer science. You will be engaged. Not too much work.",
    "A lot of interesting material that can be difficult to take in because there's no textbook. The lectures vary from semi boring to very very interesting. Same goes for the readings. If you go to class you'll be fine.",
    "The lectures are awesome. The exams are easy, but if you make a couple silly mistakes, your grade can easily suffer. The paper is straightforward.",
    "I have already recommended this class to all of my friends.I described it as getting your mind blown twice a week with reading fascinating studies in between.",
    "Meh",
    "Doesn't turn out to be as exciting as it is in the beginning, but still a good course. Took it as a senior for a more relaxed schedule, grading is very generous. Scholl is a great lecturer - aside from the some of the linguistics lecturing, I found it all very interesting and easy to pay attention to.",
    "This class is very interesting and I love that there aren't any textbooks so it keeps everything interesting. He is a very good lecturer.",
    "It is graded generously (50% of people got either an A or A-). it is not a lot of work. The readings are not on the test and can be skimmed for the reading responses. Most readings are not interesting, though I did them all. The tests are of average difficulty and if you know your concepts, you should be fine. You can also skip a certain number of questions with no penalty, which unfortunately reduces spread and leads to grades being more clustered together than they should be. The paper topic is very tame (discuss the real-world significance of cognitive science or lack thereof). What you will learn is that cognitive science has little current real-world significance; it does confirm widely-held beliefs (don't talk on your cell phones while driving) and helps explain why, but has limited applications. Some of those applications (especially in the lecture on sex, love, and attraction) are interesting, but the interesting parts of this class could be summarized on two pages of notes. I don't think you should waste one of your Yale credits on this class unless this class is required.",
    "Survey course on Cognitive Science.",
    "YES, I would highly recommend it no matter what field you're interested in! It's a fascinating course that covers material from a range of perspectives to keep everyone engaged. And lectures are actually really great!",
    "The topics studied are extremely interesting. Because so much information is covered, however, the exams can sometimes contain questions that may seem rather arbitrary.",
    "This is a great intro course. Sometimes it moves too fast.... but every topic is intriguing and eye-opening. Prof. Scholl is a great lecturer and an interesting guy.Also, happily, there's no section for the course.",
    "A good introduction to cogsci that is fun and interesting. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "OK, so if you're interested in this stuff and hope you to study psych, cog sci, or something similar, then I suppose you should take this course. The curve is very generous and so the class is not too hard. Plus the studies you learn about are important and fascinating. That all said, a lot of people have a cultish affection for Brian Scholl and this class. I'd caution you to take people's raving affection with a grain of salt. Scholl can come across as pretty arrogant sometimes and tries very hard to be the \"cool\" professor (e.g. he likes to swear in class all the time). (He's also unhealthily obsessed with showing pictures of his daughter in class.) The material is relatively interesting, but you could learn just as interesting stuff outside of this class. Definitely a fine class, worth shopping, and probably worth taking, but don't bank on this class being life-changing. Also, if you do take the course, expect the exams to be graded pretty harshly--the questions are vague, but Scholl is looking for very specific answers. The paper is also graded very harshly; I expected it to boost my grade, but it turned out to be the lowest component of my grade.",
    "The course is interesting and lectures are entertaining. Readings are often confusing, dense, and irrelevant, but still very manageable. The paper is fun and really lets you engage with the topic in a creative and thought-provoking way. Brian, however, was a disappointment. He is engaging and charismatic, but at a certain point you realize he is so smug that it makes you tired listening to him. Additionally, he has a neurotic obsession to force students to attend lecture. Therefore he makes the lecture slides cryptic and not instructive at all. Lectures however are extremely dense, long, and include many technical details and unfamiliar jargon. As a result its very difficult to take comprehensive notes. Weeks later when studying for an exam, its very challenging and fusturating to try to recap what happened throughout the course since there are no guidelines or real slides. You find yourself spending hours in front of the slides trying to remember or figure out what Brianmeant in some random satirical title. This wastes too much time, and eventually you feel like you don't really know what you need to know, and anything properly. Given the fact that Brian is so smug I'm surprised he doesn't have enough confidence in his lecturing abilities to attract students to come to lecture and he needs to resort to these pathetic schemes. Nonetheless he does seem to care, is friendly, and writes very long emails to the class on a weekly basis. Overall, the class is good, but definitely not great, and can be very frustrating (but this can easily be changed if Brian makes an effort to do so).",
    "Rather fun lectures, boring readings, spunky professor and low amount of work (thought there are several readings every week). It is a fair class and teaches you some interesting things and if it were a car it would probably be a Honda Civic with a body kit. It is rather amusing, kind of interesting and looks sort of comical and serious at the same time. Under the hood you will find an engine, but it won't be incredibly powerful and it wont be life changing, it just gets you where you want to go.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is very interesting.",
    "One of my favorite classes at yale",
    "This class was excellent, and is the beginning of more classes for me in this field. It was absolutely fascinating, and opened my eyes to many paradoxically simple and yet complex questions regarding our often overlooked abilities to see, talk, think, decide, and more. I heartily recommend the course."
