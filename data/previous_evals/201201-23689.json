    "The opportunity to play my research ideas and results off my peers and Dr. Ashton. It really gave me a chance to explore my research and to learn from watching others explore theirs. I greatly gained from Dr. Ashton's time and experience. I actually hated having to give the same\/revised presentations about my research over and over again throughout the year but in the end I realize that this made me much more comfortable about the story of my research. Please make this style of class available to all students who want it!",
    "Professor Ashton's feedback on written and oral material. It helped refine my work.",
    "Dr. Ashton provides invaluable support to students working on their master's project. I could not have done it without him or without this course. This course offers a community of peers that is working through the same struggles. And through this course I discovered how much I enjoy editing and giving constructive feedback! AND I became way way way more comfortable presenting. I'm so glad I took this course. Thank you Dr. Ashton!!!!",
    "Deadlines and feedback on our work and performance.",

    "Mark Ashton! and the group comments and discussions.",
    "The focus on research and maintaining a goal of publishing and superb guidance were exactly what I needed in order to finish my research (and well) for my masters degree.",
    "It really helped me develop my thesis, it was crucial in keeping me on track (schedule-wise), and all the practice in presenting was very very helpful when it came time to present at the Colloquium.",

    "FES NEEDS ANOTHER FACULTY MEMBER TO STEP UP AND OFFER THEIR TIME AND EXPERTISE IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES!! IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT NO FACULTY MEMBER DOES SO. DR ASHTON IS FILLING A BIG GAP IN THE CURRICULUM ALL ON HIS OWN - So, the thing about this course in need of improvement is to split it into a natural sciences and social sciences section - at the LEAST.",
    "I only feel bad that Mark was taking on such a large load -- I STRONGLY suggest that other professors step up to make more courses like this available.",
    "The only problem with the course was the size. A social science professor should teach the second section so that the group can be smaller and with more similar research interests\/topics.",
    "Smaller groups.",
    "The class size was too large because more people had gotten word of it.",
    "It was too large of a class. It should have been limited in number. Also, although it was helpful to get the practice in presenting my work, hearing my colleague's presentations again and again became tedious. If we had fewer students we could have supplemented the presentations with other exercises.",
    "It would have been good to have some readings or outside materials on writing and presenting, though honestly I don't know that I would have had time to read them.",

    "I wish that there had been a year long class like this during my first two semesters as well. It would have greatly helped me to develop my research and prepare for the summer field season instead of leaving me feeling like I was in completely over my head. Natural Science Research Methods filled this gap somewhat but I feel it could be expanded to help the new MESc students.",
