    "It was an easy class (there were 9 extra credit \"pop essays\") so you only needed an 81 average on the three exams to get an A-. The exams were not easy, but they were not super hard. It was an interesting class, but not mindblowing. Lots of time spent going over the details of each disorder which can get tedious.",
    "The main problem iwth this class is that class itself is almost the same as the textbook, especially because the prof. wrote it. Hard to fault her with that, but doing both, one would always feel redundant. You hope to get more out of class than the textbook, but the material is too similar in each, and the videos (presumably an attempt to overcome this) are not illustrative enough to achieve this. More depth would be necessary in class for this class to be worthwhile.",
    "PSYC180 is a broad overview of many psychological disorders, with focused study of a few representative disorders like schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, etc. The material was all very interesting and the tests were not hard at all if you did the reading. Honestly, I only went to lecture 3 times the entire semester and I still got somewhere in the high B range. A very easy fifth class so long as you do the reading on your own, and she provides a study guide for each test telling you exactly what you need to know.",
    "really interesting material, delves into specific disorders, you get to read some great memoirs and meet people with actual disorders, only 3 exams, no papers, no final. overall really gain understanding into psychological disorders.",
    "Yeah, but the exams are really nit-picky (the second one was a killer) but Dr. N-H is very aware of the amount of work involved and gives pretty through study questions. Take C\/D\/F or if you take it for a grade, make sure you have the time to devote to it. And a hint, if she asks you about a hormone affecting something, it's dopamine!",
    "I would recommend this course. Prof N-H provides study questions before each test, and if you complete those you will do fine. There is not much outside work and there are also \"pop essays\" in class that boost your grade. No paper, sections, final during finals period, and the tests aren't cumulative. Easy class while still learning about mental disorders.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!! MUST TAKE!",
    "Definitely! This class has really interesting material and Professor Nolen-Hoeksema presents it in a way that makes lectures interesting.",
    "This is a pretty easy class. The material is interesting and not difficult to remember. Lectures and the book are basically the same thing. Go to class! Each \"pop essay question\" she gives is worth one percentage point, and those points definitely add up. Not much work at all; I'd definitely say take it.",
    "Great lectures, great content. If you study for the tests, you will do well. It's very much a class that you get what you put in. And, if you have any interest in any of the helping professions, this class is a must.",
    "Absolutely! It's a good way to dip your head into Psychology, even if you don't intend to major in it.",
    "The course is fairly straightforward. You go through the pathologies, their symptoms, theories, and treatments.It's not just that, so don't be scared of being bored. If you are at all interested in the material, you will enjoy this class. It's, at least it is to me, fascinating to learn more about disorders, and how they affect people.The professor wrote the textbook, and she can basically answer any question you throw at her. So that's cool. The lectures aren't brilliant, but they somehow manage to make you pay attention throughout.The tests aren't too hard at all. I'd say this class is basically a guaranteed A- if you study for the exams. There's no final, just 3 non-cumulative midterms, and--awesome--there are pop essays every couple of lectures that give you an entire point on your final average, which is three points on a test.I would take this class: good lectures, good prof, not hard, interesting stuff. Fo shizzles.",
    "Yes! It was a great class.",
    "This class is really interesting, and the professor is really good, very knowledgable about Abnormal Psychology. There are a lot of videos and such in class, which makes it fun to attend. However, it is a large lecture and it is easy to just be on the Internet instead of paying attention.",
    "Exams are fair and the study guides are incredibly helpful. The homework is all reading and most of it is very interesting. The Pop Essays can be life savers, so be sure to go to class everyday. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the material.",
    "Very interesting class. Not too hard and chance for extra credit points if attending class. Really like the material and guest lecturers",
    "Psych 180 is a good course to take if you're interested in the material (which I think a lot of people are because of their own (direct or indirect) experiences with mental disorders).",
    "good core psych class. information is interesting, professor is good.",
    "I would definitely recommend that you take this class. It has a really laid-back feel and everything about it is really cleanly structured, so it is a pretty calm and non-stressful experience. You also will learn a lot! Prof. Nolen-Hoeksema presents everything in a clear and engaging way and has lots of different videos and case studies that help your understanding of the material. I really enjoyed all of her lectures and think she is a really great professor. Thebook (which she wrote) is equally clear and engaging and also has relevant and interesting case studies in it. It's a quite nice reading experience. The material in this class is relevant to everyday life and in my opinion is an important thing to know about. And, since the general tone of the class is rather understated, it becomes a pleasant surprise at the end of the semester when you realize how much you've learned. Really, this class is like the academic equivalent of leisurely sipping some really high quality tea. Take it.",
    "Yes. Great Course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else, especially if they are or are planning on majoring in psychology.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot about psychopathology and it is not too difficult.",
    "Probably not, unless you absolutely have to. It made a pretty good Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Not a hard class and very interesting. You only need to go to lecture or read the book, not both. The exams are fair and the workload is not at all heavy. I really enjoyed it.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend it. Really interesting, and it was so wonderful to have a class without papers. They lectures are all great, and the book is written (very well) by the professor, so the readings and the lectures fit together perfectly. Also, the Professor is really big on decreasing stigma, which is both interesting and incredibly important - if (like me) you've ever shied away from psych classes because you don't enjoy hearing yourself or people you care about described as these super tragic figures, this is the class for you. And if you've never thought about issues of stigma but you want to be a psychologist, this is also definitely the class for you. We read some great books by people with mental disorders who then came and spoke to our class, and the Professor also emphasized throughout that clinical psychologists treat individuals, not disorders.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 180 to another student. It's a great class, whether you need an So or just a credit for the major. Take it!",
    "Good psych course. The tests can be difficult and there's a lot of material to memorize but Professor Nolen-Hoeksema offers so many extra credit points you should be fine.",
    "Interesting class, not a whole lot of work. The reading is essentially the same as the lectures plus some stuff she doesn't have time for in class.",
    "Abnormal Psych is a survey of axis I and axis II clinical disorders, touching on symptoms, diagnoses, theories, and treatment approaches for all. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone-- psych major or not, you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "Great class, interesting topic, not a lot of work. By the end you will be diagnosing everyone around you with mental disorders.",
    "A great survey of psychological disorders. Yes I would recommend it. The subject matter is intriguing (some of it hits home), and the professor is enthusiastic and supportive of students.",
    "A great class, better taken if you've had some psych experience, but anyone with an interest in abnormal psychology should take it!",
    "This is an amazing course and I highly recommend. The exams are fair, there is extra credit via pop essay questions that are very chill and also intriguing, and the text was very enjoyable to read. I enjoyed coming to each and every lecture and I can't think of a better way to become acquainted with abnormal psychology than to take this course with Professor Nolan Hoeksema.",
    "Definitely recommend-- very interesting and fair class!",
    "Awesome class - a must take at Yale! The workload is low (only 3 noncumulative exams) and with optional extra credit pop essays scattered throughout very feasible to get an A. Lectures are very interesting, lots of videos. Also you read 2 books by people who battled with mental disorders and they come in for guest lectures.",
    "The course is an overview of different psychological disorders. The book is very thorough but straightfoward, and she weaves in interesting (but old) videos of people talking about their disorders. There are also two autobiographies, which are both amazing. And the authors came in to talk to us, which was great. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I was a little uneasy at first because the class is such a large lecture course, but it was a blast and I learned so much. Very interesting for anyone who wants an introduction to some of the most strange and interesting mental health disorders.",
    "TAKE this class, buy the book, and you will not be sorry. Next to Human Emotion--this is one of the best classes offered at Yale. Subject material always interesting.",
    "Pretty comprehensive overview of abnormal psychology and its illnesses. Go to lectures and read the chapters before exams.",
    "Overview of all abnormal psychology behaviors. Reading and lectures. No homework. No writing. Great class to take credit\/d",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you're not a psych major, it provides great insight and overview of the field of abnormal psychology.",
    "This is a very straightforward lecture psychology course. 3 non-cumulative exams with multiple choice and short answer. You have to read two books throughout the course which are pretty interesting. Lectures are actually fun because Professor Hoeksema plays countless videos all throughout which help you to get a more personal\/humanistic perspective of the disorders being discussed. The exams are extremely fair as well.",
    "Good course if you are interested in the material. if not, obviously dont take it.",
    "This is a really interesting course that I'd highly recommend. The tests are difficult and really nit-picky.",
    "Basic overview of abnormal psychology, disorders, and mental health. Lots of DSM talk and some interesting material",
    "Abnormal Psych was a basic survey class in abnormal psychology. It sometimes got a bit repetitive, but the information was always presented well. Professor Nolen-Hoeksema was a great lecturer and knew the material very well. She also integrated videos and guest speakers into the curriculum, which made the information much more interesting and understandable. This class wasn't the most outstanding lecture I've ever taken, but it presented the relevant material well.",
    "Yes. Take it. Very, very easy. With the extra credit, I only needed like a 65 on the last test to get an A. Not a lot of work. Very digestible. Learn the material, take the tests, and move on. A great 5th class. Interesting lectures and subject matter. Definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this if you enjoy learning about psychological disorders, but you could learn just as much from buying the book b\/c you probably won't enjoy lectures and wind up studying for the 3 exams by cramming the text book in.",
    "Abnormal Psych was a phenomenal course. It was not very difficult - it is possible to get an A without reading the textbook, though you have to study the lecture notes very carefully and do the reviews carefully. The class was very interesting, low stress, and provided great coverage of the the key areas of mental disorder. Professor Nolen-Hoeksema also did a great job of fostering empathy for, and removing the stigma towards, those with mental disorders. Overall, a great course for psych majors and those who have taken intro psych and are looking for a social sciences credit.",
    "I would recommend this class!",
    "yeah. if you like psych. it's an easy gutty intro, but the material can be totally trippy and crazy.",
    "Take this class! I am not a psych major, and I took the class CR\/D\/Fail which was a great decision since the exams can be tricky. The lectures are very interesting, and the material you learn in class is AMAZING!The reading load is very manageable, and you will want to do it all. You learn about psychological disorders such as schizophrenia,bi polar disease, depression, anxiety etc. Nolen-Hoeksema always delivered really great lectures, and she does a wonderful job of showing really interesting videos in class. Also, she brings in guest lectures that were great! You have three exams that are all weighed equally and no final. This was really nice. Also, you can raise your grade by attending lectures and answering little essay questions during the lectures. For every essay you complete, you get a point that is added to your final average. Last semester there ended up being 10 of these essay opportunities, so this really helps students out. Take this class!",
    "Yeah. It was easy. Don't take it if you're not a strong memorizer though - this is not a \"concepts\" class. You have to memorize DSM-IV criteria and spit them back out for the test.",
    "PSYC 180 allowed me to gain a basic understanding of various psychological disorders, their causes, and their effects. Video clips and guest speakers provided me with a better understanding of symptoms and effects. I would definitely recommend this class to other students thinking of pursuing psychology. I think it was a very valuable introduction to psychological disorders and their causes.",
    "A relatively easy, but very interesting course. I actually think everyone at Yale could stand to learn something from this class. Not everyone has a clinically diagnosable mental illness, but everyone suffers to some degree from maladaptive emotions or thoughts. As a result I felt like this class taught me about myself and about human nature more broadly... Nolen-Hoeksema shows great respect for the humanity of those living mental illness--for which I'm very grateful. Guest lectures from authors with living with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder really helped humanize the disorders.",
    "Now that it's not a writing credit, it's a perfect gut. Interesting material, engaging lecture, and a very (probably too) generous extra credit policy. The guest speakers are awesome, too.",
    "good class, fun, very little work besides studying",
    "Good class, not as depressing as I originally thought it would be. Not too much work, but you do need to do the readings as you will get tested on them.",
    "Great class that teaches you about abnormal psych in a very dynamic way- there's a wonderful textbook, and Professor Nolen-Hoeksema does a good job integrating books speakers and videos into the lectures.",
    "This is a basic overview of abnormal psychology. If you're not actually interested in the topic, you might find it boring, but if you're interested in psychology you should take it. Reading and lecture overlap a lot, but hey, Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema wrote the book, so I feel like that's fair. You should still go to class though because she always shows video clips of people with the disorders, and those are worth seeing. Three multiple choice and short-answer tests, each a third of your grade.",
    "I would summarize as it being a good intro course to mental health disorders. I would recommend it to anybody remotely interested in the topic.",
    "Lectures are somewhat boring and very much repetitive of the text. However, the information is interesting. The class provides a broad overview of a multitude of different disorders.",
    "I would recommend psych 180 to another student, if you like psychology. This is the second psych class i've taken, and i found the topics very interesting.",
    "Awesome class, definitely recommended.",
    "The structure is pretty typical for a psychology lecture, but I enjoyed Abnormal Psych because Nolen-Hoeksema didn't just read from her slides. The slides were helpful but her actual explanations were more detailed and interesting.The problem was that exams were really not appropriate for the course. There were a number of obscure questions that I think missed the most important ideas of the class.",
    "Yes. This is a fun class in which you not only learn about the disorders but also learn how to treat them.",
    "It's a good, interesting class. Take it even if you're not a psych major!",
    "This is a relatively easy intro class. Take it if you aren't a psychology major and would like to know more about the subject matter, or if you would like an easier lecture as a psych major. Coming to class is not essential for your grade, but reading the textbook is.",
    "Definitely recommend- even to non-psych majors, who think the topic is interesting.",
    "3 exams total (multiple choice, short answers). No final. Very doable. Come to lecture so that you don\u0092t miss out on the extra credit questions in class. They add up and can basically raise your grade by a whole grade average.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in clinical psychology. The material is very clinical--examining biological and psychosocial origins of mental illness, their symptoms\/diagnoses\/manifestations, and drug and psychological treatments. It's interesting stuff but can get a little dry, especially if clinical psych isn't a big interest of yours. The exams (three in-class, no final!) are VERY fair and not too hard, plus there are many opportunities to earn extra credit points in class. Professor Nolen-Hoeksema is a great lecturer and clearly very knowledgeable. Workload aside from the three exams is minimal. Overall, I'd say this class is definitely worthwhile if it is a topic you're interested in.",
    "Great class, you go through a disorder per class -- like autism, schizophrenia, etc. Three non-cumulative midterms (mostly multiple choice), plus extra credit \"pop essays\". Go to lecture, study the study guide, maybe read the book, you'll be set. Take it! Susan Nolen-Hoeksema is great, and top in her field!",
    "Lots of interesting intro level material. A must for any psych major.",
    "If you're a psych major it might be helpful to take a course in abnormal psychology, especially because studying the abnormal helps you define the normal. Also this course could be helpful if you're thinking about going into clinical psychology."
