    "CSDC 330 is an introduction to sustainable investing, sustainable business practices, and a lot more. One leaves the seminar having delved very deeply into at least one field within the course's topics. I, for one, amassed a huge amount of knowledge after having taken this seminar. Most weeks feature a guest lecturer from a corporation, a fund, or a governmental body. Topics range from investing with ESG metrics, carbon reporting, the \"Clean Trillion,\" green finance, resource management, etc. I would 100% recommend this course to another student, especially if he\/she has any interest, at all, in business or sustainability.",
    "A really interesting class if you're interested in business, sustainability, finance, investing, etc. There are many different guest speakers offering various different viewpoints, which made for a rich experience.",
    "Must-take if you're interested in finance, econ, environment, energy etc. Great run-down of the sustainable business world in the operations, policy, and financial management senses. Very manageable workload, interesting readings. It might seem dry having to listen to the guest speakers, but you should take time to research their backgrounds - truly impressive leaders in their fields.",
    "If you're looking for a super chill 5th class, take it. Guest speakers were hit or miss. Some were really interesting, others not so much. Krosinsky is a really nice professor, but the work and the content isn't very intensive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "This was a very interesting course, with lots of cool guest speakers and taught by a pretty awesome professor. Not much work, minus a two big research papers.",
    "Business and Sustainability is a great course that is a must take for anyone interested in business, finance, or the environment. You read a few very interesting books and hear from some very cool guest speakers.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have a background in economics and investment. Otherwise, a lot of the concepts won't make much sense. Interesting course that brought in many great speakers with great backgrounds in socially responsible investing and sustainability."
