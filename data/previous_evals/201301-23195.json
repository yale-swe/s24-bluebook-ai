    "Though this class could never exist again in the same way, I would definitely recommend taking production seminars like it.",
    "A chance to read, understand, study, and live Richard III. Think about him until you dream about him. Compare him to everything else. A healthy obsession.",
    "This class will never again exist in this form, of course. But go find out what Joe Roach is doing this semester. Ifyou're still young, count your lucky stars: you can start taking all of his courses right now, and you can start working on convincing him to direct you in something. (Doesn't really matter what.) If you're old (like, say, a senior), what are you doing?!!?! Look at your life, look at your choices.",
    "The selection of readings was excellent.The discussions in class were pertinent, and brought my attention to aspects of Richard III I did not pick up on while reading the play.The diversity of talents (actors, musicians, set designers, stage managers) working on the project were one of the main strengths of the course, and helped me understand the implications of staging such a play.The course, being a production seminar, extends beyond the scope of regular academic work, while still being at a very high intellectual level. The professor encouraged students to use this ambivalent aspect of the course in their final papers. Kudos to that.You will learn a lot about yourself as a person too.The work load is light, if you don't count rehearsals as working hours. Otherwise it is humongous.",
    "Any student interested in theater and\/or Shakespeare should take a class like this. It is an intense immersive experience that is very rare at Yale, but very necessary for those who love the theater.",
    "Great class. Obviously this exact class won't be offered again, but if you have an opportunity to take a production seminar (or any class) with Professor Roach, you should! Keep in mind that it's a big time commitment outside of class though.",
    "I would recommend it as a wonderful mix of literary analysis, performance theory, and practical theater.",
    "Production seminars are a wonderful experience both from a literary and performance perspective. That being said, make sure you have a good idea of your role in the seminar, whether as part of the cast, crew or other. It helps you to connect to the text, and that's the entire point of a production seminar. It's not just an English class!"
