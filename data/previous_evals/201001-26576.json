    "It worked out well because of the correspondence with BP.",
    "Yes",
    "yes",
    "Yes, but this course could have been 1\/2 semester shorter to cover what we need to know as architects, no more no less.",
    "yes",
    "A lot of the materials presented in this class seem to have direct relationship to our licensing exams. I really enjoyed the materials and studied really hard, but I don't know if they will be outdated or forgotten when I actually get to take the exams. So perhaps part of structure III could be a seminar format occurs towards the end of our three years?",
    "Occurs in the proper sequence with respect to the school's curriculum.",
    "Since I did not have any background in structures prior to this program, I found ithelpful to have this knowledge early on.",
    "Yes, though structures is tedious at times, I learned a lot from this course and itwas valuable, especially this semester, to learn specifically how various materials behave structurally. By the end of the semester, we could calculate structural loads on our BP houses, which felt like a big accomplishment.",
    "Structures II was a good extension of the concepts introduced in Structures I, although it included a little too much review of the previous semester\u0092s work.",
    "It is in the proper sequence.",
    "yes",
    "The building technology section of structures made it more appropriate for the morepractical approach of this semester."

   "comments": [
    "The material was all interesting and useful information. The assignments were right on point.",
    "I think that most of the material was very relevant and well integrated into BP. I think that the syllabus was appropriate and that the assignments though intense were worthwhile.",
    "Again, there were many theories and equations we dicussed and practiced at length that I'm positive that I will never use again. The course could have been much shorter, covering just the essential concepts and a few equations. More application to studio would have been great.",
    "Course material had a nice balance between a more quantitative understanding and a more conceptual understanding of structures. Assignments directly reinforced the material covered in lectures.",
    "The sequence was clear and well-organized. The assignments were varied (problem sets, building competitions, etc) and that change in pace was nice to have.",
    "There were way too many hours poured into this class every week. 6 hours a week of just class, plus at least 2 hours per week put into homework, we are spending 8-9 hours on that class per week. That is way too much time for a subject that can be condensed considerably.",
    "This course was an egregious waste of time. Moon barely speaks english well enough to communicate. The information was scattered and elementary. Weekly there were 2 or 3 different assignments (as if for 2-3 different classed) including the structures homework, studio re-representation, and \"discussion section\" homework. All of which were essentially useless time sinks. They could be combined into 1 assignment per week with some meat to it.",
    "Although there is a lot of class time and homework involved in this class, I don't think there is a better way to learn the material so that it actually sinks in during really busy semesters when we don't have time to study independently outside of class. Prof. Moon was very accommodating to move assignments and even class times around when they conflicted with other major deadlines in studio, etc.",
    "The topics covered were great, especially those relating to steel and concrete design. Too much time was spent at the beginning of the semester reviewing, and so many of the later topics felt rushed through. The homework assignments were very helpful in reinforcing the concepts presented in class.",
    "I think we covered everything that was essential. I know Prof Moon would have loved to have had more time with us, but I think we got everything out of it that we needed to.",
    "The course workload for this class should be taken into consideration when balancing overall workload for all classes vs available time for students. We were in class for 5 hours a week and weekly assignments typically required 2-3 hours.",
    "Assignments and tests were very manageable, and Professor Moon was always very understanding of the scheduling of other classes, which made it easier to both attend and perform for his class."

   "comments": [
    "I figured it would be as great as Structures I and I was right.",
    "Expectations were high - they were well met.",
    "I expected to gain a new way of seeing architecture or a possible source of inspiration in the knowledge of construction, physics and technology that goes into architecture. These expectations were met.",
    "I wanted to have a basic knowledge of building structures with some quantitative work in areas where it would be particularly relevant, and I think that was achieved.",
    "I expected to learn the basics of structures, and truthfully thought that there would be more math and physics calculations involved. But the concept-driven syllabus with math where necessary was much more effective in allowing me to actually learn the principles necessary for architectural practice.",
    "My expectations were to better understand how to size structural members and buildings as a whole and that is exactly what we did.",
    "This class was exactly how I expected it to be."

   "comments": [
    "Buildings have to stand and be safe. You do that with Structures. I want to keep people safe so it was extremely valuable.",
    "Very valuable. I think its important to learn about structural concepts and trying to integrate them into the design.",
    "Learned how to quickly conceptualize a structural system in terms of its members and forces acting upon them, as well as how to roughly determine member sizes and configurations.",
    "I think the material taught in this class is valuable and is not covered in any other course, so it is important to have this for students.",
    "I'm glad I took this class, even though it was tough at times. I really learned a lot this semester and last. Sometimes it was even fun!",
    "This course was especially valuable when it made direct connections between structural concepts and our design work, particularly the work we did on sizing structural members. The assignments in which we reviewed our studio work for structural considerations were also very valuable.",
    "This course was very valuable to me as I had no experience with any of the information. I feel much more confident in accurately sizing something like a floor slab now.",
    "I believe structural training is very valuable. Professor Moon was particularly good at taking the structural learning out of the abstract context to apply it to both our studio projects and the real world. Having not taking structures I, I found it incredibly interesting and helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Moon is an amazing professor. He really knows how to present the material so that people can understand it easily. If the class got stuck on something you can see him instantly evaluate what might be causing the confusion, and then immediately come up with a new strategy for explaining the material. He is such a great professor because he is constantly evaluating his presentation of the material and looking for ways to make it easier to understand. Professor Moon was the reason Structures was such a great class. The TA were also really helpful with homework and answering questions. They are a must have for this class. The whole class setup works great.",
    "Professor Moon sets up good example problems and has them re-encounter them ourselves in the homework. It's as though we're being taught twice - very effective.The TAs were always there to assist u with the homework and review sessions and did a grat job as well.",
    "Professor Moon was an excellent teacher and so were the TA's. Each made great efforts to make sure they were being understood.",
    "Professor Moon is an effective lecturer - he encourages class participation, and frames technical discussions in a way that is relevant to architecture students.",
    "I really appreciated Professor Moon's teaching style and approach. He clearly is dedicated to making sure we, as a class, understand the material. However, he also understands that we are balancing a very heavy work load, and tried when possible to integrate our studio projects and to accommodate our schedule and deadlines from other classes. He makes the material as interesting and relevant as possible, and keeps an open and enjoyable atmosphere in the classroom.The TAs and the weekly reviews are invaluable to the course.",
    "The TAs essentially taught the material as Moon would come in and scribble something while mumbling in a barely intelligible accent.",
    "Professor Moon was great with our class this semester. He was always available and always willing to work with our deadline and scheduling. He was probably the most flexible professor, which was greatly appreciated. He expected us to complete the given work, but took our over-loaded schedule into account.This class does require too much time for a first-year schedule. Two 2-hour classes, a 2-hour discussion session, homework each week and a 2-hour weekly review is too much with 5 other classes.",
    "Prof. Moon was a very good teacher--very patient and understanding of our crazy course load this semester and last. His classes were straightforward and usually clear, and the pace of the material felt right, not too rushed. The TAs this semester were very good. Daria Zolotareva, the main TA for the course, was excellent. She painstakingly explained difficult material step by step during regular review sessions (which I attended less frequently this semester than last, maybe because this semester's material was easier to grasp).",
    "Professor Moon was knowledgeable and presented the material well. He was also very understanding of our overall schedule, and was flexible in rescheduling certain classes, which was very helpful. I appreciated his ability to emphasize how structural concepts affect our work as designers, and also bringing in some more theoretical topics in order to give us a more grounded and mathematical understanding of certain concepts. Sometimes it felt like the course moved a little too slowly, but this seemed largely due to the fact that many people in the class did not take Structures I and were at a disadvantage to those who did.",
    "I found Prof. Moon to be a very effective instructor.",
    "the weekly homework sessions by the TAs was helpful",
    "Everyone was very helpful and available. The TAs' help sessions were instrumental to many of our classmates in completing the assignments. Professor Moon was incredibly helpful in assisting me with clarifying my structural concept for my studio project.",
    "I had some trouble with structures 1 and really appreciated Professor Moon's ability and willingness to work with me and help me through difficult subject matter this semester. He's a very dedicated teacher."

   "question_text": "Suggestions you may have for course improvements:",
   "comments": [
    "None. Completely satisfied.",
    "Class time scheduling - long and occur too frequently and too close together in the week.",
    "The dependence on note-taking in class is strange.Why not use a textbook to teach us? We could do examples outside of those in class, expand our understanding, and become better at the material. Only doing examples in class means that we can only understand the example given in class, limiting our ability to respond effectively to diverse problems.",
    "Shorter, less course material. No more spaghetti marathons.",
    "I loved professor Moon's class. I apologize for not being able to attend a few sessions due to studio deadlines. The make-up classes are much appreciated. I felt I learned a lot in the class and your class makes me love structures even more!",
    "The class could have benefited from more useful lab time - rather than constructing structures from pasta, it would have been great to actually test trusses and various materials (concrete, wood, steel) to observe their deformation and failure.It would have been nice to have these types of application labs every week, so that we could physically observe the structural properties we learned in the classroom in a mostly theoretical way. This would have given us a more intuitive understanding of how structures resist loads.",
    "I had a great time throughout the year!",
    "Less class time.",
    "Unify the course so that there are not 3 disparate parts but rather one coherent whole.",
    "Students will always complain about structures--how much class time and homework time is spent on it--but I don't think you can actually learn the material without that, so I wouldn't suggest changing the schedule. Prof. Moon is great at teaching the course. I'm sorry that next year's class won't have the chance to learn from him.",
    "The course content should be re-evaluated so there is less repetition of the previous semester\u0092s content and more new ideas introduced. The discussion section assignments should be coordinated and scheduled well in advance, and it would be helpful if there were not homework assignments and discussion section assignments due within the same week.",
    "My only suggestion would be to try and cut down the number of hours in class, but I don't know if that is possible. After class three days a week and a review session with the TA's it feels like it has taken up half the week.",
    "The final assignments seem rather untimely, particularly the last spaghetti assignment. Otherwise, I believe the course was valuable."
