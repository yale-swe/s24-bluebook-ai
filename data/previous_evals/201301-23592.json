    "Would definitely take this course again. Professor Tomlinson is one of those professors you must take before leaving Yale. He will change the way you think. Very interesting texts, reading is manageable for a seminar. Papers were also manageable. But be warned, Tomlinson is a hard paper grader.",
    "This is a fascinating course, though the reading is pretty dense (but, I mean, look at the reading list ...) These are three books everyone should read and Prof. Tomlinson is a fabulous discussion leader. Frankly, he is one of the smartest people I have ever met and class was always a whirlwind of ideas and discussion -- very absorbing!I would take it if you are interested in the books and are seeking a great Professor. Be warned: he cares about good writing! Don't take this class if you want to just doze off in the corner or if you aren't planning to do the readings. (I should also add that I took it Credit\/D and that I decided to take the course because if fulfilled an Intellectual History requirement for the Humanities Major).",
    "this class is actually as cool as it sounds in the description. workload isn't terrible, professor is amazing (and very, very smart), and the material is very quintessential yalie knowledge. even coming from an engineering major, take take take! (credit\/d though if you don't wanna stress about grading. he seems like a rather fair grader but the assignments are tricky and unpredictable).",
    "Sometimes the readings are long and difficult to understand, but if you put the work in, you can get a lot out of the course.",
    "An AMAZING seminar!! Perfect if you're interested in broader epistemological questions and the history of scientific inquiry- especially amazing for science majors who haven't considered these questions before. I thought it was the perfect class to take my senior year after studying mostly sciences at Yale. Tomlinson is an amazing, caring, BRILLIANT professor who leads amazing discussions- take this class!!",
    "As the title suggests, this course focuses on the nature of science and human sciences and to what extent the two culture divide exists. It accomplishes this task through synoptic readings of the works of Galileo, Vico, and Darwin with particular attention to the methodological innovations and epistemological frameworks involved. The writing assignments are short, but allow plenty of time for revision because Prof. Tomlinson pays a lot of attention to grammar and style. This may be your only chance to study these works that played such an integral part in shaping the modern scientific worldview, so take it if you can.",
    "Yes, it's a good fifth class."
