    "One draft a week, 2 drafts per essay, 5 essays per term. You will read pieces for every class that are in the 'genre' of the piece you are writing for that week. Class will include discussion, writing exercises, and workshopping (commenting on you or your peers' essays). It is an introduction to creative nonfiction.",
    "Every week you write either a draft or a revision of the essay genre you're focusing on. For homework, you will have assigned readings and a reading response every class, except for workshop classes, where you will instead read and comment on a classmate's piece. Dr. Hopper has a great extension policy (for every draft and revision) for those students who see a Writing Tutor. I would definitely recommend taking the class, because even though there is a significant amount of work, you will learn a lot if you put in the effort and the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "It is an introduction into writing from the first person. Yes i would recommend it, especially if interested in writing about oneself in the future.",
    "This is a solid course. I was on the fence between taking 114 or 120, but I'm glad I chose 120 in the end. The workload is a lot in the first half of the term: one draft or revision every week (for Hopper's section at 4:00 pm Mondays). You learn to write in the confine of a deadline which vastly improves your writing. The second half of the termhas less work as you get to choose which essays you want to write. Grades for the first essay will be harsh, so be prepared for that. Also, make sure to have your draft or revision reviewed by a writing tutor - it will improve your grade and writing!",
    "It is a great class that develops writing skills, teaches writing tools, and helps literary analysis. I would definitely recommend it. Moderate work load.",
    "i would highly recommend this course--it is for every type of english student. Even those who do not define themselves as the \"english major\" end the semester loving English 120.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is fairly confident in his\/her writing ability and who wants to learn creative nonfiction techniques in an introductory setting.",
    "I would summarize it as a class on the modern essay, with a lot of topic and structure autonomy, which greatly facilitates the writing process. I would recommend this course to another student because it seems I enjoyed this class much more than my colleagues in other English classes, and I still learned a lot from this class.",
    "Out of all the classes I've taken so far at Yale, this is the one I would recommend the most to any other student. It is a fantastic intro english\/writing course. There is no doubt that I was a better writer even after the first essay, and I can't say enough about how my essay writing has improved since then."
