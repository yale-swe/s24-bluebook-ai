   "comments": [
    "It's AB\/BC Calc all over again. Take it if you need to, or if you are interested.",
    "NO. I would not recommend this. But if you do have to take this, find a good teacher. You need it. This class is a headache, and the exams are never fair.",
    "No. Math 115 is an incredibly difficult class. The course moves very quickly; I took AP Calculus BC in high school, yet i still struggled in the class. The majority of the teachers are not capable of explaining the problem in the best possible way due to a language barrier.",
    "A relatively easy class if you already know integration. Good foundation for future math classes.",
    "It is not a horrible math class but can be challenging. You must stay on top of the material\/work and make sure you learn well from you TA.",
    "It is a fast paced and at times tough class-- definitely harder than your high school BC calculus class. It is a good class to take if you are looking to strengthen your foundations in math.",
    "If you have taken BC Calc before, it shouldn't be as difficult. But let me assure you-even many of the kids who had taken BC before found it difficult. The miterms were difficult, but there was a fairly generous curve. If you are not meant for mathematics, this course will certainly show you that.",
    "I would recommend this for a student who is properly prepared for the course and is willing to put in a lot of work. It is extremely tough to keep up and keep a high standard of work. Most reviews here are probably saying that the course is very poorly taught, but truth be told, the sheer volume of work makes it impossible for any instructor to adequately teach the course in such a short space of time. Professor Han Li does an adequate job of it, and he is willing to personally help you if you ask for it. MAKE SURE YOU ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND or you'll get lost in no time.",
    "Unless you need it for a requirement, it isn't really worth it.",
    "As I've heard from everyone else who has taken the course, it is much more stressful and confusing than it needs to be."
