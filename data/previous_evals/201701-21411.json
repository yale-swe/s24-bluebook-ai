    "We so often have to read new authors every week in classes, and I was refreshed\/relieved to focus on three writers whose personalities and *essences* I feel like I could understand by the end of the semester. Regardless of the classroom environment, these books \/ short stories are incredible, and they are worth spending an entire class on (or more). This class, as a result, is usually baseline good; but the fluctuations depends on who's in the class and, sometimes, how Deming is feeling. He can sometimes lead class forcefully, but he's often quite hands-off, and the latter technique only works well if your class is ready to talk to each other. Sometimes, though, it frustrated me that Deming didn't seem more committed to leading us to a goal in our conversations.",
    "Its fitting that this seminar begins with this dictum from Emerson: There is then creative reading as well as creative writing. When the mind is braced by labor and invention, the page of whatever book we read becomes luminous with manifold allusion. The course helped me to grow as a reader, not merely in aptitude but also in my philosophy of reading. These writers and texts challenged me to reflect about the moral imperative to read, to reflect about not only how to read but also why. Language is action, Emerson tells us, and the course challenged us to (begin to) master those actions, both in solitary reading and in shared dialogue. I grew as a seminar participant, particularly how to listen, argue with conviction, and learn to find the balance between making bold claims, arguing tentatively, and learning from fires and misfires alike.",
    "My ability to engage in complex intellectual and academic discourse, examining rich and difficult philosophical, historical, literary, and political issues increased greatly. I gained a thorough understanding of a certain American academic intellectual tradition rooted in Emerson. I would like to say my ability to \"think\" improved.",
    "Emerson was a really enriching and beautiful experience. I learned to read creatively and think collectively with a bunch of really smart people.",
    "EH&M changed my life. I realize in saying this I'm falling back on clich, but I promise you this in not exaggeration. I move through the world with a different mindset now, and EH&M and Deming are to blame. This class helped me realize the fundamental limits of human understanding and expression. On top of that, it pushed me to understand the importance of continuos thinking. I can't think of a better course to take as a student working through the liberal education.",
    "the class improved my ability to write academic papers. It also made me think more about what I say, which is probably a good thing. (can I defend my opinions, etc.)",
    "These difficult but transformative authors are now accessible to me. I will continue to rely on them for the rest of my life.",
    "I learned how to think critically and analytically about texts, but also how to read through them and learn about who I am as a person - this is a class not just for your diploma, but for your soul, and its development and constant progression!",
    "Learned a ton about the three figures that the course covers, as well as their mutual interrelation, and their relation to broad historical themes and currents of 19th-century America.",
    "Learning about Emerson, Hawthorne and Melville were really only the tip of what I gained from this course. I learned how to approach a text, how to engage in seminar, what it means to read and interpret a work of literature. Everything that we talked about was high stakes.",
    "This class definitely helped me develop my sense of self as a reader. I think I also took a lot away from the shared thread of thinking throughout the authors, particularly concerning the troublesome\/beautiful nature of human subjectivity. Deming is brilliant and his thoughts are wonderfully clarifying."

    "This course functions best as a seminar, and I enjoyed how much the students themselves had the opportunity to shape discussion. Professor Demings system of reading responses works, both because of the challenge it offers to the writers and the insight it offers to everybody elseits an opportunity, after all, to see how 15 different and often very fine minds work. I thought Professor Deming did a good job steering the conversation in a way that allows students to take free reign but stay on a path he believes would be especially generative. But, as he is far and away the wisest person in the room, I wish we heard from him more. Some of my favorite sessions were the ones when he delivered the last word, a five-minute or sometimes ten-minute synthesis of what weve talked about and what he thinks. These moments made the class excellent. I was floored, for example, when he pushed the seminar to a self-reflective place to analyze why we laughed at a line in \"Young Goodman Brown;\" his final remarks at the end of discussions about the end of Moby-Dick and Uses of Great Men\" were fantastic. But some days he mostly stayed to the sidelines except to mediate the conversation, something essential to an excellent seminar that he does exceptionally well. I just hope he talks more at the future, because he has so many wonderful and instructive things to say about these texts.",
    "This is a stellar course. Everything about it is a strength.",
    "Strengths: Deming creates a classroom that encourages authentic and meaningful thought. He amazes me, for leading a seminar to that calibre requires patience, genius, and empathy. You will be a better person for taking a class with Deming. Weaknesses: Melville and Emerson dwarf Hawthorne. He cannot stand up to the other two in prose, perspective, or philosophy. I heard a rumor that Deming intends to replace Hawthorne with another author -- while any author may still have the relative weaknesses that Hawthorne has, this may be a step in the right direction!",
    "Strengths: interesting writing to discuss, a good amount of reading, engaged seminar setting. Weaknesses: some people who liked to talk but didn't say anything wasted a lot of time. We probably could've spent more time on moby dick and less on House of Seven Gables.",
    "Originally I with that professor Deming would speak more in class, and whenever there was a debate about a question I looked to him to settle it, as an authority figure. Now I realize that he, just like us, was engaging, learning, and facilitating our learning experience about ourselves. This was an absolutely wonderful course, and a gift to be able to partake in it.",
    "It was engaging, with the perfect amount of student discussion and guidance from the professor. Everything that we talked about felt like it mattered. No time was wasted getting to the heart of what we were reading and why it was important.",
    "Maybe make it smaller (?) I think some of the quieter students were drowned out by the more talkative ones."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Deming is a great seminar leader, intervening enough with profound thoughts so that everyone takes away the big idea while also allowing students to discuss and struggle through thoughts without his mediating. He clearly loves the authors we read, and that makes everyone else more engaged in texts that I wouldn't have read on my own. It's worth it alone for Moby Dick; I only wish we had even more weeks to spend on it in class. I would particularly recommend this class for upperclassman English majors or people very comfortable with literary criticism, since those were the voices that dominated in the class-- the texts are not easy and the seminar falls apart if people don't do the reading. Be prepared to read Moby Dick over spring break. Professor Deming writes pages and pages of comments on both the midterm and the final essay. It's very helpful, and shows that he really cares. If you're willing to do the work and engage in class, this is probably one of the best American Lit options out there!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I think, for your benefit and the benefit of others, you should be someone who is willing to participate and always do the readingif there are people who slack off, discussion falls flat and no one can really dig into these authors. Because Deming is somewhat of a hands-off seminar leader, you need to be ready to make the class what you want it to be.",
    "This is a phenomenal seminar featuring one of Yales most talented professors, three of the finest writers in the English language, and a complex meditation on the moral imperatives in reading, in writing, and in dialogue. This class will challenge you, not merely from all the hours spent (and without a doubt well-spent) reading Moby-Dick and Emersons finest essays but also from the intellectual rigor that everyone brings to the seminar table. Take this class and give it the attention it deserves: You will grow as a reader and a writer, a listener and a student. I have no doubt that this is one of the classes I will think about decades from now.",
    "This is unquestionably one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. (The prerequisite for enjoying this course would probably be being passionate about American literature.) Everything about it is stellar: Professor Deming, the reading list, the level of discussion. I literally got better at thinking. Take.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely. This class serves as an example of what the liberal education is meant to be. It will ask you to take on new perspectives; it will demand you to create authentic thought, then defend it on the spot; it will push you to realize the limits of your own thought, then ask you how to move past those.",
    "The course is about what you'd expect. You read Emerson, Hawthorne, and Melville. There are two essays. Professor Deming cares a lot about his students, so you should go to office hours. There will probably be some section assholes, so try to ignore them. It's not as fantastic as the reviews say, but it's pretty good.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS IF YOU GET IN",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course - it is phenomenal, and life changing!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interesting in learning about the genesis of American literary greatness. All three figures are hugely important and the syllabus is incredible.",
    "One of the most engaging, thought-provoking seminars that I have sat in, with the perfect amount of student discussion and guidance from the professor. Everything that we talked about felt like it mattered. No time was wasted getting to the heart of what we were reading and why it was important.",
    "Definitely take this course! I didn't think I would be a huge fan of these authors but Hawthorne and Melville are wonderfully weird. It's a great reading list with a great professor!"
