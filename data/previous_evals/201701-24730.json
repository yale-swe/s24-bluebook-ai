   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this class are that I'm done with it. It was poorly taught, incredibly disorganized, and the grading was incredibly subjective, personal, and unfair. Overall, a terrible, terrible class.",
    "The strength of this course is absolutely the readings. The studies we read were compelling, and it was really exciting to be exposed to some of the important literature in educational economics research. The weaknesses of the course, unfortunately, outweigh the strengths. Perhaps this is a result of this course being a new offering, but Professor Altonji often seemed unprepared for lectures. During almost every class, there would be at least one moment where he came across a slide and didn't understand what it was saying, or where in the process of explaining something to us he would stumble and become confused. this made studying and taking the quizzes very difficult. The frequent quizzes seemed unnecessary and could be easily replaced with reading responses, which were much more meaningful. Another weakness was the discussion section, which was so poorly run that they ended up canceling it because nobody went. When only 10 people enrolled in the course, Professor Altonji should have altered the course to be seminar-style. I feel that it would have been much more engaging and productive this way.",
    "There is a ton of great content in this class, but it's a little to technical for anyone without a strong understanding of econometrics. It's definitely not an Econ class for students interested in education but not economics. That being said, I think it would make for an amazing senior seminar or lecture (where everyone is more on the same page about methods). I would also suggest reviewing the quizzes in section or in class immediately after returning them.",
    "This course is strong in that Professor Altonji is one of the leading experts in the field, and is able to speak directly about techniques that researchers have used and new knowledge. It is also strong in that it is an interesting approach to Economics, and teachers students how to quantify soft variables. However, it is weak in that it is not very unified throughout the semester -- you simply jump from one topic to the next. Sometimes the topics are very similar, and it feels like you're learning the same thing over again with no reference to what you just learned. It is also weak in that although 10 people were in the class, Professor Altonji treated it like a lecture. I think it could have been more interesting and engaging with more discussion. I understand that may change in future years if more people take it, but I think that if it remains under ~20 people, Professor should try to engage students more."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to my worst enemy.",
    "It's hard to recommend this course to another student. On one hand, the readings are incredibly interesting and generally pretty short. The textbook for the course is well-written and helpful, and the studies we read were compelling. However, Professor Altonji was clearly ill-equipped to teach this course. He was quite often unprepared for class, and it showed. He would stop in the middle of lecture, become confused about a certain topic, and then move on. It's really a shame- this class has a LOT of potential, and the content it covers is so important for future economists, politicians, policymakers, and educators. If you are interested in the material, at least give this class a shot during shopping period- perhaps Professor Altonji will have improved in his second time teaching the course!",
    "This is a great class, but not for the feint of heart! Definitely targeted at people win a strong background in economics, but who want to apply theoretical and empirical methods to education. Tons of great content and interesting recent research - but only if you are game to take your time with the papers that are assigned and read the textbook (which is hilariously written and interesting).",
    "This class is OK. Granted, when I took it, it was the first year it was being offered, so maybe some of its flaws will be worked out in the future. If you're interested in education and want actual hard data to inform educational debates, this class is for you. (That's why I took it.) However, you shouldn't expect to walk out being able to authoritatively say that the data proves one thing or another, because the research results are all very mixed. Also, I found that I didn't really think in this class -- the work requires more memorization than anything else, and lectures aren't that engaging."
