    "integrating surfaces, finding volumes of functions with several variables",

    "Learned about Calc 3, math is math so pretty standard material.",
    "Beyond learning the basics of Multivariable Calculus, I developed skills in preparing for math exams at Yale. I think the strategy for and approach to QR assessments at Yale differs greatly from my experience in high school, and this class helped me figure out how to best attack such exams. It also helped me develop better study habits, as you can't just wait until the last minute to study; you have to be very driven and start studying (even for just a little bit) on the earlier side.",

    "strengths: small class size, weekly homework, help available through peer tutors, review sessions, practice exams are accurate and many are available weaknesses: differences between sections",
    "I think the course moves fast, but rather than slow down the pace which is not possible, I would offer optional homework in addition to the weekly assignments just to ensure the students have grasped the material.",
    "It does encompass every aspect of Calc 3 pretty well. It could be improved by standardizing the teachers, because all the teachers have different styles and it makes for a different experience for every student.",
    "There is a lot of material covered in the course. While I don't know how to solve this problem without subtracting some of the topics covered in the course, it might be nice to have more time with each topic so that the students can really understand and appreciate the material. At times, I felt like I was just struggling to write down all the notes covered in class without really processing the information. It was only after the fact when studying for the exams or doing the problem sets that I really learned the material.",

    "Yes, this was a fun class, but if your major does not require it, do not waste your time and efforts in this demanding class.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to continue math at a higher level. It is definitely not an easy course, but I think it is worthwhile for those you are really interested in\/passionate about math or want to pursue it as a major.",
