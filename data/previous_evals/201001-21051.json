    "Vienna\/Berlin entailed looking at Germany and Austria from a mostly macrocosmic viewpoint. We covered a lot of material, but not in great depth. It did seem that individual student projects probed issues in depth, but I wished the class had dwelt on fewer topics longer. Our focus began a bit before the beginning of the 19th c, and ended a bit after the turn of the 20th century, however this is not a class on Expressionism--I actually think this was a great aspect of the class, as we learned about material that is almost never taught. I would recommend the class to another student for the unusual nature of the material, the way in which it enforced self-edification, and for the frankly incredible trip that ended it. The trip alone made the class worth it, but the material was also a great introduction to non-Paris-centric 19th century history."
