   "comments": [
    "This course did not focus as heavily on writing as I had first anticipated. However, I found our discussions (that formed the bulk of our classes) even more valuable in the end than what one would expect of a simple writing course. This course helped me to develop my rhetoric and logic as well as showing me how to write a good academic essay. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "A great class. I would recommend this to people looking to read Plato, Feyerabend, Kuhn, Popper, or any other writers of the sort. Some of the readings are tough but the class will take extra time to figure these out, rather than just moving along without you.",
    "Yes, will really help you learn how to argue more effectively in prose.",
    "It is a challenging course but you learn a lot. It really makes you think in a different way.",
    "Yes! This class will certainly revolutionize the way you conceive of Science. The material is interesting to read and Templanza does a good job of guiding the classroom discussion towards understanding the material presented. He will grade you pretty harshly in the beginning to bring you up to speed and motivate you to try harder. Your grade should be fine by the end though :).",
    "I would recommend.",
    "Definitely. If you like science and want to understand what 'science' really means, I highly recommend this course. Be prepared to question your most basic assumptions and end with more questions than you began with. Just be warned that this course is largely philosophy based and it will make you question some of your most fundamental views."
