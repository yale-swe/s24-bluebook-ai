He is really knowledable about the topics over just knowing what to type in R. His feedback on the homework was especially helpful and definitely helped me improved my stat skills.",

He was clear and organized throughout, providing detailed feedback on every assignment and offering thoughtful guidance on building knowledge through each course topic. Henry always made himself available, was proactive in explaining complex issues, and encouraged students to improve themselves. Henry worked harder than any TF at F&ES.",

    "Instructor: Henry Glick \u00a0Henry was a fantastic teaching assistant. He was incredibly responsive over email and always available to answer questions in office hours. He explained confusing concepts clearly and efficiently and was very approachable. He also provided extensive and very helpful comments on graded assignments, which I am certain was very time consuming but I found invaluable in helping me improve throughout the course.",

    "I was very frustrated with Professor Gregoire's lectures. He is thoughtful and supportive teacher, and clearly an expert on modeling data. However, the lectures did not emphasize important ideas or concepts on each occasion; instead, they were like chipping away big topics piece by piece. This made it difficult to understand and remember the key ideas we did cover (splines, mixed effects, etc).",
    "I learned a lot in the course but there was sometimes a bit of a mismatch between the material covered and the assignments. I think I would have felt more confident if we'd had more, smaller homework assignments beginning earlier in the semester. It was also sometimes challenging to gauge how much of the statistical concepts I was grasping when they weren't as necessary to apply on the assignments. Having an in-class examination would have been a useful benchmark of how well I understood the theory of the course.",

   "comments": [
    "The homeworks were very useful to understanding the concepts. We had enough time to do them which is really important for R when you can get stuck on one piece of code for a while. The lectures were a little difficult to sit through without getting a little lost or distracted but the notes were great.",
    "Homework assignments were a good way to implement concepts covered in class.",
    "The seven problem sets were appropriately spaced and provided a meaningful iterative process to help students learn the material. As TF, Henry Glick's excellent topics were very helpful in fine-tuning my knowledge and process over the course of the semester.",
    "The homework assignments are very useful. They gradually increase in difficulty. Tim is a great lecturer, and makes dry material accessible and engaging. I expect to be referring back to Tim's lecture notes and scripts for years to come.",
    "I enjoyed working on the assignments and putting rubber to road in R. I thought the modeling techniques we learned were interesting and useful.",
    "I learned how to use R! I am certainly no expert, but I really do feel comfortable with the program basics and the statistics involved."

   "comments": [
    "The instruction of the course was not very engaging. Lectures were primarily a recitation of class notes and read directly from a projected pdf. It's fairly dry subject matter taught in a dry manner.",
    "Class lectures were difficult to follow. The 80-minute lecture is a challenging format to maintain attention. It would be helpful to have specific, short reading assignments completed in advance to compliment the lecture. Or, assign students to introduce a topic (or summarize an idea) once or twice each during the semester. The course slides are well-meaning but do not stand on their own. It would be helpful to improve the slides by emphasizing takeaway messages and action steps. I also suggest adding a weekly section to review the week's lessons and review R code and methodology carefully.",
    "I really enjoyed working through scripts with Professor Gregoire in class. I would like to see more of this during lectures."

If you insist on taking FES 753, this course covers different approaches to regression modeling and is valuable to ecological and forestry data. I do not recommend it for social science students. Be sure to consider other courses beyond FES in the Statistics Department, the School of Management, or the School of Public Health.",
    "Take it. You're unlikely to find such an accessible treatment of statistics anywhere else. This course will also increase your confidence and expertise with R and statistics far beyond simple regressions.",

Tim's notes are very dense but extremely helpful, but I sometimes needed a few reviews before I really understood what was going on. Don't be afraid to ask questions - Tim and Henry are both very approachable and can help make sense of what seems impossible!",
