    "Slides could be more succinct as there are some overlapping between the lectures. Slides could also exclude those SAS code and output as they were discussed in the lab session and wasn't mentioned during the class. The instructor herself is pretty responsive and knowledgeable. Thought this is a applied course, if it possible, I would love to learn more reasoning or theoretical background as sometimes I were a bit confused about what were I doing and why I could use this estimate method, things like that. After all, very useful course.",
    "The context is OK, and the lab is perfect. However, I do not think I can understand the knowledge points in the class but from the labs and homeworks.",
    "This course is literally THE WORST course I have EVER taken during my ENTIRE LIFE. Professor Lin's lecture notes are disaster. They are messy and unclear. All of us as her students felt that we were insulted. Prof. Lin did not show any respect toward her student as well as her responsibility as a professor. In addition, her lectures were really unclear as well. Her oral English needs a lot of practices. We suggest that Prof. Lin should review and take TOEFL again. It is really disappointed for us to see such irresponsible professor teaching at Yale if she refused to improve her teaching styles in the future.",
    "Covers main topics in longitudinal analysis, but wish it could talk more about theory.",
    "It would be better if the instructor made organized lecture notes.",
    "The lectures are detailed, and the lab sessions are helpful in both theoretical and programming aspects. The lecture notes in the second half of the semester are more concise than those in the first half, containing exactly those information needed in class. This course would be better if it goes into more details about the theories behind the models.",
    "The course gives a lot of knowledge of longitudinal study.",
    "Need to spend a lot of time for self studying",
    "This course is not very well organized and can hardly be regarded as helpful. Topics of this course cover most of longitudinal and multi-level data analysis, but for most of the lectures, neither lecture slides or teaching is organized logically. In my view and that of some my classmates, the lecture slides are not readable, partially because some of the words\/sentences are out of the limit, and also because the content is not coherent\/consistent, making readers confused about what it is talking about. Dr. Lin is trying to make her lecture more friendly and include lots of real examples, but I found the structure of lectures is problematic, as she fails to spend enough time helping us tackling the essential idea and corresponding math behind model, most of the time was spent on examples that are not that informative. Besides, a lot of the homework problems are not very clearly expressed, and it sometimes took us and TA great efforts simply to figure out what the question is, which is annoying for me.",
    "Strengths: 1. having lab 2. having documents to follow in lab 3. providing slides in lecture 4. office hours twice a week Weaknesses: Bearing in mind that is it far easier to criticize than to do, the following would have helped me in this course: 1. Putting readings on the syllabus with the date they are due (homework too) 2. Giving the grader a key 3. Listing all course requirements in the syllabus (the presentation wasn't included) 4. Making sure both softwares are included equally would have been helpful 5. There were some struggles with time management for lecture and lab 6. Sometimes what the TA's and Prof say don't match 7. Grading on homework isn't useful. Writing \"not correct\" with the number of points off isn't enough information.",

    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Her ppt is poor, I find it hard to get the logic. Also she always repeats points that I think are not important, but failed to focus on the real key points.",

It is really disappointed for us to see such irresponsible professor teaching at Yale if she refused to improve her teaching styles in the future. If Prof. Lin really takes this survey seriously, here are my suggestions: Please please please retype your lecture notes. They are the primary learning tool for us to learn. Please please please think carefully about how are you gonna to teach in your lectures. You said you know some students thought that labs were more useful than your lectures. It's not a joke, it reflected that your lectures had very serious problems.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0very responsible and patient",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin is very responsive to students' questions and willing to consider students' advice in teaching.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Professor is willing to help student with questions and her class is well-prepared.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin's teaching style is hardly appreciable as quite a few of students cannot understand her lecture even faintly. Also, students sometimes find their emails regarding to this course couldn't be responded promptly, or in a helpful way.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0One-to-One office hour is good while the lecture notes are not very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She is so, so kind. Making the lecture slides less busy would be helpful to staying focused in lecture."

    "Useful course, but need to spend more time for self-studying.",
    "There are problems for Lectures, but the lab classes are more clear in explanation.",
    "In short, this course teaches a lot of material, but is not a good fit for students who use R or are not in the Biostatistics department. Some of the problems listed above made the course harder than it need to be, I think."
