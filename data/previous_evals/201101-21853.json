    "Wonderful",
    "Really great course if you're interested in the topic. Not too much work and the discussions were really enjoyable as were the dinners with distinguished faculty.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student interested in augmenting their ability to read and discuss scientific papers.",
    "The best science seminar at Yale in my opinion. Some brilliant professors and very interesting material.",
    "This is an excellent seminar which provides a great opportunity to read and discuss interesting primary and review articles in the field of evolutionary medicine. The workload is what you make of it - you will certainly get more out of the class if you come to seminar prepared to discuss the articles and bring questions for the group. The guest lecturers are also very interesting and a wonderful opportunity to interact closely with important players in evolutionary medicine.",
    "This course was amazing. I hope the professors keep offering it--the EEB department needs every high-powered course it can get. Mainly we just read papers and discussed them. There wasn't much written work, but everyone did the reading so don't expect to get away not reading. Overall an amazing experience and I'm looking forward to the summer.",
    "Take this course (if you can!). A hidden gem in the sciences. A rare opportunity to get to know some top science professors on an almost first name basis. You really feel like a colleague in the course, rather than a student. The topics are varied but relevant and the professors are all very into the course. Definitely requires a critical mind and a science background, though applicable for those going for grad school, med school, or just out into the real world upon graduation."
