    "If you are generally frustrated by ambiguity or disorganization, this probably isn't for you. Grades are very unclear throughout the term. Readings sometimes appeared hours before class meetings. More broadly, the course content is highly diffuse at times. All that being said, it was a really fun class and Brad has a beautiful mind. If you can handle the loose structure and his, well, just shop the first class and you'll know, then by all means go for it. It's not a gut (i.e., midterm is serious).",
    "Brad Rosen is the real gem--his teaching makes Law, Tech, and Culture a memorable cornerstone of the Yale experience. The material is relevant and shifts depending on current events. Nowhere else will you have a discussion as low brow as skank\" vs. \"slut\" while also discussing the importance of the internet to marginalized people. This course was one of the highlights of my semester.",
    "Take it if you think you'd be interested in the material. The class isn't a gut but it also isn't super difficult. It talks about interesting stuff",
    "If you want to read a whole bunch of law articles and kind of come to a conclusion about them (I say \"kind of,\" because you learn very fast that there is no right or wrong answer), or if you want to have a professor who constantly curses and makes rude jokes (it was really funny at the beginning but gets old very quickly), this is the class for you. If you need an SO, take something else. I took this for the distributional and totally hated it.",
    "This is an interesting class but it is important that it is right for you. On the first day Brad is going to say that if you aren't comfortable with how the class operates, then you should not take the course. This is definitely true. There are students who take it because they hear there are cupcakes every day and that you can swear in class, but it is important that you actually enjoy the material. That being said, if you do take the class, prepare for a really unique experience, no other classes are like this one. In terms of workload, there are five reading responses (4-5 pages double-spaced), one midterm, a class project, and a final group project. The midterm is take-home but will honestly take forever if you don't read. Even if you do read it is an absurd length. The midterms were graded fairly quickly but reading responses can take a long time to be graded. As of now, I am still waiting for the grades on three of them and I'm done with finals. Overall, it is an interesting course, but definitely make sure it is right for you before taking it.",
    "!A: I took this Credit\/D, so I got what I put into this course: LITERALLY NOTHING. My big advice: DONT TAKE THIS CREDIT\/D. Im not going to blame Brad or this course because this was on me, but be wary that this is a course where its incredibly easy to slack off and getting nothing out of it. The membership of this class was as expected: expect to see a lot of washed-up seniors\/ all the members of Ladies of High Street GroupMe (Think Theta and Fly with Pi Phi). WORKLOAD: You will have readings twice a week. Theyre pretty tedious, but very interesting if you do them. Mostly legal documents\/court cases. I didnt do them regularlyat allso the midterm was quite challenging. I still did fairly well on it though, because you should know the grading is very lax. But you have to pick two out of three lengthy (each is about two pages single-spaced) scenarios that you have to interpret using the laws and norms that you learned about in class. I must have spent about 7-8 hours on it over the weekend (which was also halloweekend), but doing that was pretty much the most rewarding thing I got out of this course. I had to answer tough and incredibly open-ended legal questions about very messy internet\/patent law scenarios. Doing the reading would make the midterm easier, but its still challenging. You have to do 5 reading reading responses (I did 4 since you can drop your lowest one). Theyre a pain if you want to do well on them. You might spend 4-5 hours on one if you really want to make it good. But I was taking this credit\/d, so my effort definitely dwindled. I once spent 45 minutes doing the last one and still got a 3.5\/5 (a decent grade). The final project was a joke (again, as Im taking this credit\/d). most people make videos or some sort of written project like a newspaper. FINAL THOUGHTS: I would not recommend this class if you are not willing to put in the work. Lectures were generally amazing and fun (I probably should have just audited this class to be perfectly honest). But to me, this was a waste of one of my 36 credits. But that is my own fault, not the fault of Brad or this class.",
    "Absolutely. If you think you are interested in anything related to the legality of technology and its uses, which you probably should be considering the tech-influenced world today, then this is a great, engaging course for it. Keep in mind there are pretty dense readings, and Brads teaching style is not for everyone, but if you find the readings interesting and think his outlandishness will work for you, then go for it.",
    "Take this course! The Professor has a very unusual teaching style, but it worked for me. During the semester I had my doubts, but now I really think it was worth it!",
    "Take it for literally the easiest credit d in the world, or for a grade that you'll be able to eek out an a or a minus, but it will a lil stressful at points because there's no feedback",
    "Really fun SO credit, take it!",
    "Where to begin... Brad has this really elaborate act that is honestly pretty effective in engaging students. He's profane, condescending, and pretty entertaining. In terms of content, this course is very inefficient. Brad spends most of the lecture watching videos with the class. After the first (kind of annoying) video, the entire class gets the point that he's trying to make. Then he goes on to show like 30 more. Before you know it, the entire class has gone by, and we've only covered the superficial layers of the readings that no one has really done besides the kind obnoxious kids sitting in the first row. What I learned from the class was pretty much all from the readings, honestly. **That said**, it was a fun 5th credit, and I genuinely looked forward to going to class, even if it wasn't usually very intellectually fulfilling. Don't underestimate the midterm, because if you don't do any of the readings it'll be challenging. If you do some of the readings, it's very approachable but still requires a lot of time.",
    "I would summarize CPSC 183 as a different type of lecture class. It has the engagement of a seminar with the direction and size of a lecture. I would deem it a Yale must-take. It was incredibly fun.",
    "Fantastic class. So relevant. Brad is crazy but there's a reason. Don't be discouraged by it. Even if you don't want to be a lawyer, this class will have a positive effect on your life. Take it credit\/d. The grading can be a bit of a nightmare and it'll be less stressful if you just take it as a credit\/d. The midterm is a TON of work and requires a lot of effort.",
    "Dope credit\/d class. You probably don't need to take it credit\/d because the grading is not super intense, but it's a cool class to just relax and listen to rather than worry about grades at all.",
    "I'd recommend if you can adjust to Brad's teaching style. I found the class to be fun and engaging, but it's not a class where you take notes and memorize facts. It's meant to provoke interesting ideas and stir debate. Relatively lower work, but interesting if you can handle Brad.",
    "Take the class if you have a legitimate interest in the intersection of technology and the law; otherwise, the class will become a hassle and a waste of time.",
    "A very cool class, different from anything else at Yale, you'll learn a bunch of weird facts and interesting aspects of how technological innovation shaped the laws we have today.",
    "It's a Yale experience, that's for sure.",
    "My favorite class at Yale so far (I'm a sophomore). This is the class they shouldve had students musing over in Thats Why I Chose Yale. It's a heavily discussion based class where you muse over the funniest and most topical readings that for the most part have a purpose. You'll learn a lot about cyberlaw, censorship, net neutrality, copyright, and more. You'll also learn a lot about what your fellow Yalies think and why. At some points it made me think of \"Ethics for CS Majors\" but you definitely don't have to be a CS major to take the class. Now, Brad. He's a crazy guy. Hes like a young Slughorn. The guy is crazy but the entertaining crazy where he knows it. I mean the first week of class was spent trying to get people to leave (well, make sure that the class is the right fit for them). I feel like he was placed in this university to beneficially disrupt the way of life and be a nontraditional professor. Meet him and decide how you feel.",
    "Take it--interesting, relevant content with an engaging professor",
    "AMAZING COURSE! TAKE IT! This was the first time I've felt this excited for a class EVERY DAY. It's definitely not for everyone, both in teaching style and material covered. At first it was a little frustrating to walk away from class without definitive answers to moral\/legal\/norms topics, but that's just the nature of the material. The practical and real-life applications of this class were something I sorely needed in a Yale class. Don't let day one intimidate you, but it also gives you a taste of Brad's teaching style. You talk about memes and parodies in a very academic yet fun way. And simply put, Brad is phenomenal. Witty, hilarious, and engaging, and down to earth - definitely one of the best professors at Yale. I strongly recommend taking the time to get to know him more. He's very easy to talk to outside of class as well!",
    "Take this course if you are good with your shopping experience. Brad is very humorous, but that might not go with everyone. Make sure you get his jokes and enjoy his teaching style. I enjoy the topics and some of the readings, though there seem to be too many if you are ambitious to finish all.",
    "If you are interested in law or how technology is being regulated. TAKE this class!!! It is really amazing and not too much work. However, the assignments you do have can be pretty laborious, especially that midterm. OMg.",
    "Shop this class to get a feel for it as it is like no other class at Yale. Brad is a one of a kind instructor who really cares about his students and his subject material. I would suggest this as an excellent class to liven up your schedule and to learn something you wouldn't otherwise.",
    "This is a fantastic course! It's definitely not for everyone, so be sure to shop it before agreeing to it. Professor Rosen and the TFs are incredible and are there to help students. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale and I find myself talking to my family and friends about things I learn in the class.",
    "Definitely shop the class before taking it. The class is not for everyone, either because of Brad's teaching style or because of the course material. However, if you're looking for a class with a relatively light course load and open discussions about (almost) anything related to technology\/law\/culture, I would recommend this class.",
    "Take this class. The readings are super interesting, Brad will make sure you're engaged during lecture, and the workload isn't all that bad. If you're interested at all in cyberlaw, and especially if you need an SO, take it. You won't regret it",
    "Law, tech and culture is not a gut. Even if every word in the title sounds like it should be a gut, it is absolutely not one. However, that should not stop you from taking it, and in fact, you should take it. Brad's teaching style is unlike any other professor at Yale. When you're in his class, you feel like you're being told a story from one of your friends about something cool that they learned . He intersperses the class with tons of fun youtube videos, and random links to illustrate his points. He'll make you want to come to lecture, and want to do the readings, because you're just genuinely interested. Some things this course covers... do people in the Ashley Madison leak deserve privacy? What happens if you bully someone online? Why do some videos get taken down from Youtube for copyright infringement, and others don't? How are things like Facebook and Tinder changing the way we interact with each other and find love? This stuff is interesting, and increasingly important in an everyday changing world. Also, you've heard about the cupcakes. The rumors are true. Every class. Of course, there is work involved in the class, 4 reading responses that are more like short papers (2 pages single spaced), about 2 hours of reading per class, a take-home midterm, a class project, and a final project. Just spread your reading responses over the semester, and don't put off planning your final project and it'll be fine. Really, I'd love to do the class over again. You should take it.",
    "Some people love it. Some people hate it. I didn't feel like I learned much from it but the class is entertaining.",
    "This class would be better as a seminar than a lecture. At the very least, it should be capped. As a large lecture, I think Brad's teaching methods lose a lot of their effectiveness.",
    "Wonderful, a must take. This class introduces you to some really important issues regarding modern technology and is super fun. Not a gut, exactly, because you do have to put thought and effort into your work, but that work is very flexible and self-determined, which was nice. The professor, Brad, is crazy and amazing, in that order. Be prepared: if you're really into the order and hierarchy and pageantry of academia, you will not like Brad, and you will not like this class. But I think for most people CPSC 183 was a fun, welcome break from status quo. I loved it, and enthusiastically recommend it.",
    "Kind of a crazy class. Brad is an odd professor but good at teaching things, especially if those things are ridiculous technology laws. Because you're required to respond to readings and take a fairly comprehensive take-home midterm, Brad insists this class is \"not a gut.\"",
    "This class isn't for the faint of heart. If you like traditional professors with traditional styles and entire seminars of navel gazing debate - this is not for you. If you like someone absurd, and sharp AF who's going to challenge you.. TAKE IT. DO IT NOW. If you're interested in law school or comp sci you'll learn a shit ton if you actually put in the work. And either way you'll prob do well... Plus if you put in the effort you'll get to know Brad personally and that's worth more than just about anything. He has amazeballs advice. DO IT.",
    "I learned a lot and it was fun in the process. It depends how much work you put into the class. I like that it was less structured than most classes and didn't use a text book, though this was a bit confusing at times. But overall I've actually taken away points that I still remember beyond class that I've been discussing with friends and family outside of the classroom.",
    "I first took this class because it was so different from all the rest; I was really excited to go every day. Brad was different, and he said everything like it was. The novelty wore off a little bit after shopping period, because the class lacked structure; I did not know when the one midterm was going to be, or how I was to participate in the course when there were 100+ kids in the course and Brad wanted all of us to verbally participate. As is the nature of classes like these, there were a few kids who (a bit irritatingly) spoke a lot, and they got to know Brad pretty well. I would love to get to know him more personally as well, but not if it felt like I had to do it for a grade. Also, I think Brad overcompensated with the number and length of readings to remove the \"gut\" label that he thinks has been attached to it in the past. The class discussion was also very interesting, but the multitude of tangents left a lot of loose ends for me (we would start speaking about something, but the sentence was never completed). Some of the readings were really interesting, but we hardly ever addressed them in class, maybe because Brad wanted to ensure that we read them on our own, but it would have been a more coherent class if we had tied it in to discussion more often. The content was very relevant, but we lingered a bit too long on copyright law and I wished we had explored more. Although I did not miss a class, I was never quite clear how to best perform on the assignments. Although the set up was new for me, and there was a lot of anxiety because of it, I did learn a lot.",
    "This is one of the few classes at Yale that goes in depth re: intellectual property. If you're interested in IP, particularly copyright, the class is worth taking for that reason alone. The class takes a refreshing and progressive perspective on the intersection of IP and culture. Over break, I was talking about IP with some friends. As I explained my own newly refined views, which had been thoroughly enriched by this class, I was astonished at the amount of information and morally compelling arguments that I had internalized and retained from the class, which I was able to replicate and incorporate in the midst of discussion. Brad knows this stuff very well, which allows him to teach extemporaneously. This makes class periods engaging and spontaneous. He also has an incredible knack for teaching through practical thought experiments and relevant case studies. What all this means is that I ended up learning a ton of useful things, even more than I realized while in class. It helps to have some background knowledge on the class' subject matter prior to taking the class, but it's not necessary. Some weeks, there is a ton of reading, and it's dry. The readings for most class periods seemed to contain a mix of brief current articles, court cases, and academic scholarship. The midterm contained the longest test prompt I've ever seen (if I remember correctly, it contained 3 question prompts, which, together, were 8 pages long; we had to pick 2 of the prompts to respond to). It was very detail oriented and took a long time to properly complete. The class was large, but Brad still managed to somehow teach it as if it were a seminar. The only drawback to the large class size is that grading duties are handled by TAs, though it was awesome that Brad still read all of the reading responses and shot quick replies to them from time to time. He also would reference people's reading responses in class. This class is unlike any other that I've taken, both because of its subject matter and because of Brad's unique teaching style. The subject matter alone made it worth taking for me. The fact that Brad is an eccentric, engaging, brilliant professor was icing on the cake.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "do not take this class unless you want to waste your time for 2 hours and 30 minutes every week and sometimes eat cupcakes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class who anyone that has any interest in either law or the internet (or ideally, both!). The course is a great overview of the laws that govern the internet, how they've come to be and how they are still changing today. If you are not used to reading legal documents, be warned that many of the readings for the class consist of these, so definitely give some time to these and remember to use both Brad and the TAs as resources, for they can be dense and difficult to understand. Also, definitely think twice if you're only taking the class because you find Brad entertaining, because even though that's a plus, if you have no interest for the material then you will stop finding the man as entertaining as you did during shopping period.",
    "LawTech is a class that analyzed our world around us through the different norms and laws that we abide by. This mainly pertains to the technological side of our world.",
    "This is a course worth taking, simply for the sake of taking it. It is not a gut, though you can get an A or A- without as much work as other courses. It's a fun course if you are the type of person who trolls the internet or is interested in law. On top of that, a class with Brad is always worth taking, but you should definitely shop it before taking it. Brad's style of teaching is not for everyone, but anyone who has spent five minutes in his class is already aware of that, so spend some time there before you commit.",
    "AAAMAZING!! yeah it's alright just take it lol",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE OMGOMGOMG!!! If don't take this course you are a huge n00b. My summary of this course is Brad. You need to meet him. You will learn a lot. It will be fun.",
    "Great class to take to learn about American laws on Cyberspace. Has cupcakes and you watch a lot of (funny) videos. Work load is manageable.",
    "I took the course with no real interest in the subject at the beginning. It was a random course I took to fill my schedule, but as the semester progressed, I found myself captivated by law. Reading court cases and constructing arguments was a task I hadn't done in college, and applying it to internet law was largely enjoyable. I found myself reading most of the material, and being intrigued. This is coming from a science major, with no past interest in law, but after taking the course I have considered shifting my focus from medicine a tad. Perhaps I won't, but this random class turned out to be one of my favorites, and Brad had a knack for making what appeared the most mundane of topics feel inspired. Although be warned, the midterm is a monster, and some people dropped because of it. Personally, I think it is very manageable, and as long as one gets over that hump, the class is very manageable.",
    "An enjoyable class where you learn about things you probably had never thought a lot about before. Workload is low. If you're not planning on going to class, this is not the course for you. The whole point of taking this course is the opportunity to hear Brad's lectures. His antics are a bit over the top (and he's aware of this) but as a result you actually learn a lot and remember it. He tricked us into learning much more than we thought we would! He also brings cupcakes to every class. This was a genuinely enjoyable class where I learned a lot, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested.",
    "This was probably one of my favorite courses at Yale. I feel like this course covers a very fascinating topic which Brad really brings to life. Brad is an amazing lecturer fueled by his over the top craziness. I initially thought that this class would be a gut. On the contrary, it ended up consuming a significant portion of my time. There is a lot of reading for every class which you should do in order to be able to adequately do the midterm. You put in as much work into the class and final project as you want. Essentially, the more you put into the class, the more you'll get out of it.",
    "Yes and no. I would recommend maybe auditing it, and still doing the reading for fun. The \"class\" part, aka the assesments, were really unnecesarily stressful because by being so open-ended, they were actually a little paralyzing. It was always unclear where we stood in the class or what Brad was looking for in his evaluations. I loved the reading and the way it made me think about modern law tech and culture!",
    "Law, Tech, and Culture is a must take Yale course. Brad is a brilliant, engaging, and wildly entertaining lecturer. I was always on the edge of my seat. I also learned a tremendous amount about law, technology, and culture, and the important ways they intertwine. I recommend this class for anyone considering law school, as analyzing court cases is a key component of the course. That said, almost anyone would enjoy this class. The material is not only interesting but also very relevant to modern day life. Please note: this is by no means a gut class. The reading is substantial, the written responses require care and effort, and the mid-term is fair but time-consuming. That said, none of this should dissuade you from taking the class. The workload is totally manageable and the creative final project is a blast. In sum, a highly, highly recommended course!!"
