   "comments": [
    "Disappointing. You will basically learn about five substantial concepts throughout the course of the whole semester, that you could easily have learned by reading a book for a few hours. The rest of the stuff consists of useless details that don't fit together. It's also difficult to do well on the exams because they are so focused on unimportant facts that you probably glossed over. There are no graded problem sets, so forget about absorbing the material by working through problems. While Prof. Jorgensen is a cool guy, he is a quiet and often dry lecturer, making the 75 minute classes a little hard to focus in.",
    "418 is great class to take. The course itself is actually \"physical organic chemistry\"; the material concerns topics such as solvent effects and thermodynamic considerations for reactions. Also, definitely try to sit in the front of the class; Professor Jorgensen tends to tell random stories, and they're usually pretty interesting\/funny to listen to.",
    "The subject material of CHEM 418 is interesting. It really should be called 'physical organic' instead of 'advanced organic.' You learn about how chemical structure is related to reactivity, without having to memorize any reactions like in intro orgo. I wasn't as pleased with the teaching: Professor Jorgensen's lectures were hard to follow at times because he speaks quietly and he used an overhead projector instead of a blackboard for notes (so you had to write notes down really quickly).",
    "yes",
    "CHEM 418 is a great course to take after sophomore organic chemistry. The workload is certainly manageable, but because of the lack of assessments (only one midterm and one final) it is difficult to find the incentive to keep up with the work and you end up cramming for the exams.",
    "I initially decided to take this course to refamiliarize myself with organic chemistry. I think it achieves that aim admirably. Much of the class is spent looking through tables of physical properties of compounds, and attempting to draw trends and mechanistic explanations out of them. Professor Jorgensen is a very knowledgeable instructor, and is usually pretty good at teasing out the important trends. His lectures can often be dry though, so be warned if you have a tendency to nod off. The actual details of what you learn are a bit hard to describe, but a lot of it boils down to using steric and electronic effects to sensibly talk about chemical reactions. Very little time was spent talking about mechanisms, and so if you are interested in synthetic chemistry you should look elsewhere."
