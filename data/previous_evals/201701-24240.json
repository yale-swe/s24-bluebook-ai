    "I got a comprehensive overview of the major international relations theories as well as the historical evolution of the theories. I was able to learn quite a bit and am pleased to note that this course has prepared me well for my job for next year. I also got to interact with people that I wouldn't have otherwise - including Political Science PhDs which was interesting to hear from their perspective.",
    "I learned the theoretic analysis of the IR in general. The course provided me a chance to think, analyze, and dissect different IR theories.",
    "Thorough understanding of key theories and texts in I.R. covering a wide range of topics."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Comprehensive overview. Small, engaged class. Weaknesses - Its hard to gauge whether this class was as useful as it could have been - because it was taught at a PhD level and there were so many master's students, I know that the master's students were certainly challenged to understand the academic side of the readings. Many of the master's students probably could have used more applied classes as well as discussions of how a theory applies today. I know it's a delicate balance, but it would certainly help to round the course out more if applied classes and topical discussions were had at least on a semi-regular basis. I'm also not entirely sure why this course was offered only in the spring - it would have been a little more beneficial to have it in the fall with IR 2 as a follow-on. It's possible to take the two classes together, but may have been easier work-load wise to have one each semester.",
    "I think the strength of this course lies on its broad coverage. Although it was never easy to catch up with the assigned readings every week, in retrospect, it was really helpful and later I realized that the syllabus was well structured.",
    "The syllabus was generally good in the breadth and depth of theories, scholars, topics, etc. covered. There were too many classes on liberalism (i.e. could be consolidated into two weeks). There was also more reading than necessary on the historiography and sociology of I.R. at the beginning of the semester. It would have been better to read some more substantive texts (perhaps from some up and coming scholars on topics that are underrepresented in the syllabus but gaining prominence in the field)."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While I would have preferred to take the master's level course, I certainly \"got my money's worth\" out of this course. I would caution them that this course involves at least a book a week - and not all of it is the Ikenberry, Mearsheimer, written for a wide audience books - some of the reading is dense and hard to sift through.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes if you've taken IR 101, I think I would recommend this course. This course surveys broad literature of IR theories, offers a chance of actively discuss our thoughts, and while doing that, it does not ignore the empirical realms in terms of the application of those theories in the real world.",
    "Yes."
