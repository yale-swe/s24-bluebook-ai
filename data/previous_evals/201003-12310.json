   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it only if you have a strong background with the IPA and understand exactly what Historical Linguistics is and what you're getting into. It is much more technical than I expected.",
    "Linguistics 112 is a really good introduction to historical linguistics. It helps to be a little bit familiar with etymology or foreign languages, particularly dead ones.",
    "It's a great survey to understanding what Historical Linguistics is really about. For majors, I would definitely recommend you take it. It might be a little hard to grasp for nonmajors, but if you're interested in anthropology\/archaeology, this is a great supplement to it, as itwill help you understand what tools are used to answer questions about migration patterns and genetic origins of people. Claire has a great sense of humor and the problem sets aren't horribly time-consuming.",
    "It's a way of exploring your interest in etymology and fun stuff like that for two or three lectures. Otherwise, expect plenty of examples from Australia that you don't REALLY care about. Prof. Bowern is really sweet but seems a little insecure, though she does seem to try fairly hard to make the class easy. And, in general, she succeeds. Could use a LOTR-related problem set or two, if you'll forgive the extreme nerd moment.",
    "Taking Historical with Claire Bowern is really fun, though I hear Ashwini Deo also does a good job. Prof. Bowern knows A LOT about every language family you can think of, and she's a reasonable teacher. The midterm, final, and weekly-ish homeworks were creative and not too hard.",
    "If you haven't taken a linguistics class before, I would not recommend this one as a first class (even though they tell you it can be an introduction). There are grad students and linguistics majors, and I always felt left behind. Unless you are really really fascinated by the material, lectures can be a bit boring.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student who had already been exposed to an introductory survey course in linguistics. Because of the undergrad\/grad mixing, I think a student with more knowledge of the subject matter would be better posed to succeed in the course and wouldn't find it quite so hard to swallow at times."
