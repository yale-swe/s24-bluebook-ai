   "comments": [
    "This was my first anthropology course, and it really introduced me to a field that I knew quite little about. Because we were required to do a few readings a week and synthesize dense papers into one sentence, this course helped me read for the important takeaways in complicated topics and succinctly summarize those concepts.",
    "I learned a lot about how anthropology as a field has developed and changed, mostly through the 20th century. The course obviously had a specific focus on the way this has happened in regards to how anthropology views the environment and human-environment interactions. However, these shifts generally reflected those of anthropology as a whole. In this sense the course was more of a 'history of theory' rather than an engagement with current theories, which was fine, but not what I expected. The readings were typically highly abstract and discursive, so I learned to become comfortable with that and fluent in that language. Though anthropology is known for being abstract, I had nonetheless expected the course to be more rooted in ethnography and concrete material than the theory that it was. There was also mostly an emphasis on what's traditionally considered the \"third world\" while reinforcing Eurocentric interpretations of cultures indirectly cast as \"less civilized\". I became familiar with these kinds of approaches, and learned how to critique them, but I think there was room for the course to provide a more rigorous interrogation of some of the colonialist leanings in early anthropology. Despite all this, I think I gained a lot of insight about tensions that exist in development discourse, environmental campaigns, and briefly in indigenous rights\/land rights discourses.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of Environmental Anthro, and the theories and themes of the discipline. Helped me understand space + place's relation to community and self, for sure. The thesis sentences were a nice way to summarize the main ideas of papers.",
    "This class provided a toolkit of primary literature with which to approach the most important concepts in environmental anthropology. It was a great way to get exposed to the discipline of anthropology. I learned the language and methods of research and came to appreciate the nuanced and open-minded stance that must accompany studies of communities of people. The class improved my skills at critical reading, discussion, analysis, and writing research papers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very clear structure of weekly sections, with readings, responses, lectures, and class discussions. The textbook was very enjoyable and comprehensive. Assignment are fair and offer opportunities to demonstrate learning and analysis.",
    "I really enjoyed the informal discussion aspect of this course and I really enjoyed the readings, although they were tough at times. Professor Carpenter has a really casual and comforting style that allows the class to openly discuss topics that are usually not risen in traditional classroom settings. Some weaknesses may include how quickly we switch from topic to topic. There isn't much time to discuss one theme in depth, and instead discussion tends to meander. The class could potentially benefit from a more focused discussion.",
    "I think the mandatory thesis statements were, while frustrating, imperative to ensuring that each student had done the readings and could participate fully in discussion. (Strength) I think one weakness of the course is that the history focuses greatly on non-domestic issues and might benefit from a smaller proportion of classic historical texts and more texts written by indigenous people themselves or more \"modern\" applications of how the history might be used. The class still generated a lot of dialogue, but I do think that changing the proportions could make the course a bit more applicable to life--I don't think that history has to mean staying in the past.",
    "There was also mostly an emphasis on what's traditionally considered the \"third world\" while reinforcing Eurocentric interpretations of cultures indirectly cast as \"less civilized\". I became familiar with these kinds of approaches, and learned how to critique them, but I think there was room for the course to provide a more rigorous interrogation of some of the colonialist leanings in early anthropology. On the other hand, it would have been nice to read some more modern ideas in environmental anthropology and also readings that incorporated the \"Western\" world in order to soften that colonialist angle.",
    "I thought the readings were mostly good, and there was a nice variety in terms of format and place. The discussions were ok, they varied in quality from week to week. Sometimes Prof. Carpenter's mini lectures went on a bit too long. I liked the final paper.",
    "The syllabus and readings are outstanding-- each piece is well-integrated with the others, and the course builds upon itself in themes and complexity in a way that is very satisfying. The discussions sometimes moved a bit slowly. It helped when Prof Carpenter or the student discussion leaders prepared focused questions-- I might suggest making these questions a requirement rather than optional each week."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended for students who want to think deeply about the environment.",
    "Definitely. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in having honest discussions about humans' relationship to the environment across multiple countries. Definitely be prepared for dense readings and work due each week, but it is certainly manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in a history of theory course, and in some of the more abstract aspects of anthropology. It would probably be good to have taken an anthropology course before to have an idea what some of the approaches in anthropology are. There is not that much concrete content, but students will definitely be challenged to think and question assumptions and different discourses\/ideologies\/etc. The class is also pretty flexible in the way the discussion is run and the quality of discussion may depend a lot on who your classmates are, which is important to know going into it. Overall, I think this course was a net positive learning\/growing experience.",
    "Not a bad class to take if you're interested in the subject matter.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in themes of environmental anthropology or the discipline in general, this is a great introduction. The freedom of the final paper gives lots of space for pursuit of topics of your interest. You'll come away with a stronger vocabulary and expanded opinions about important themes. It's empowering."
