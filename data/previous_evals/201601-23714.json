I also found the end-of-semester debates to be an excellent want to highlight many of the complexities facing modern day environmental managers and policymakers when it comes to addressing invasive species.",
    "Because we had to write a response to questions every week, everyone in the class was equally engaged from a variety of view points.",
    "I love discussion based classes, and this one certainly didn't disappoint. For me, this is a far more effective way to learn than weekly lectures.",

This is not a reflection of the course or professors, but may be an area to focus on in the future (e.g. individual and group grade for project)."

    "Definitely worth it if you think that invasive species management will factor into your future professional work in any way. I will add the caveat that this class doesn't tell you how to address invasives or how to identify specific species, so if that's what you're interested in the class probably isn't for you. But if you're interested in unpacking some of the underlying theories and social and ecological complexities between species invasions, it's a fantastic course.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in land management, forest health and policy.",
    "Take this course! Complete the weekly reading, and take your time on the weekly responses. This course will give you what you put into it. I really enjoyed this platform for discussion each week, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in invasive species management."
