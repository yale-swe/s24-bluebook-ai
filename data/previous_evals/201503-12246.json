    "The History of Vietnam is an exhaustive look at Vietnam's past all the way from pre-history up till the 20th Century - you will come out of it intimately familiar with the country as a concept and as a nation. Highly recommended if you're interested in a deep understanding of the country, as this spans a wide timeline.",
    "Yes. It's a good class but be prepared for very demanding essays.",
    "Course was excellent, and it was a privilege to be able to take such a small course with one of the best scholars in the field. The best advice I can give is that this class, much more than some other courses I have taken in the history department, is what you make of it. If you did all the reading and came ready to contribute to class discussions then your understanding of history and historiography grew and was strengthened. If you did not and merely coasted by (as a surprising number of students seemed to) then you did not get nearly as much out of the class, and passed up on a rare privilege to be able to discuss issues in Vietnamese historiography with one of the best in the field."
