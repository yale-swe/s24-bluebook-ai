   "comments": [
    "It's actually a really interesting class. I took this course because I needed a science credit, but I wish I had taken it earlier as a freshmen or sophomore because I would have definitely taken more Anthro courses had I done so. The topics are engaging and thought-provoking. In terms of science, it's a wonderful mix of light science and social studies.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone no matter what their major is. Its relevance carries over to many areas of study, and it provides a different perspective if you're not used to studying material from an anthropological stance. Professor Valeggia is great, the TAs are great, and the course is taught extremely well. Definitely take this course.",
    "A great class regardless of your level of science knowledge, would definitely recommend it. Professor Valeggia is an amazing instructor.",
    ".Decent if you need a science credit, but there are better options out there. It's obviously a gut class, but the grading can be surprisingly tough",
    "A really engaging lecture with an even more engaging, interesting, accomplished, down-to-earth professor. Take this class if you are willing to spend time (not much) outside of studying for the midterm\/final to engage with the material.",
    "One of the better science credits.",
    "Claudia is an amazing professor. She is engaging and insightful. This was one of the best classes I ever took. There was a short discussion question (about a paragraph) due each week and a midterm and a final. Totally reasonable and the material was interesting!",
    "Great class, take it.",
    "Pretty interesting. Good for a SC credit.",
    "Great class.",
    "This is a good science credit for a non-science major, especially considering the lack of problem sets. Everything is a really qualitative assessment, which I liked a lot. Would recommend if you need a science and are more interested in something bio-ish, but it is not something I would have taken if not for the science credit. Good class that isn't too demanding, but won't be a lifechanger.",
    "This is an interesting, engaging, and relatively easy science credit. As long as you go to lecture and do the readings, you should have no trouble on the tests. The material is also very cool, with plenty of sociopolitical implications to consider, if that's your cup of tea. Definitely take it!",
    "A broad lens to look at aspects of human biology and behavior. A great introduction to anthropology. Not very much work, but the final can be a lot to handle. Claudia is a very passionate professor, and if you enjoy tasting many different things at the same time rather than going in depth into one thing, this is the class for you.",
    "This is a good course for information about human biology, ecology, and evolution. Lots of time spent on male and female reproduction. A good science credit for non-science people: accessible and not that much work.",
    "This is class looks at how evolution impacts how organisms develop over time. If you need a science credit or are interested in the contact, I would take this class. However, waking up at 9 am was really hard. That was the main downside of this class.",
    "Yes! Anthro will give you a good overview of concepts in human evolutionary biology and how that plays into our everyday lives.",
    "This is a solid science credit. The science part is pretty easy, though there is still a lot of memorization for the exams. We have to submit weekly reading responses, which can be annoying, but it's still not a lot of work. It is interesting since it is an Anthro course so you will actually learn some cool stuff if you are interested in evolutionary bio.",
    "I would recommend this class but it is not exactly a gut. The grading scale is actually quite unforgiving and they are strict graders, no curve.",
    "Yes, would recommend.",
    "Would definitely recommend.",
    "I'd definitely recommend to social science-oriented students who are looking for a science credit. Honestly, it's not the most riveting course or taken but the material is often interesting and not very challenging.",
    "Absolutely, absolutely take this class. I am a humanities\/politics type of person who came into this course needing a science credit and was utterly blown away by how fascinating the subject of anthropology is and how relevant so many of the themes discussed are to my particular interests. This course definitely gives you a much-needed broader perspective on human biology in the rest of the world and proves beyond any shadow of a doubt why the biocultural approach is necessary in questions of medicine and biology. Professor Valeggia is an excellent lecturer and the TAs are all incredibly helpful. Don't skimp on the readings - there's a good bit, but they are one of the best parts of this course and I ended up assiduously taking notes on all of them for myself because they were so fascinating. I now regret a little bit that I wasn't exposed to anthropology earlier because I had no idea it was this amazing. Hands-down, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. So if you're willing to work hard for an amazing science credit, or if you're interested in just taking a course that will transform the way you think about history, science, and politics, absolutely sign up for this class.",
    "Interested course especially if you've taken other classes on the immune system and medicine because this gives you an anthropological perspective on biomedicine. Very interesting and not much work for a science credit. It's weekly reading response questions (10 total of which you drop 1) and 2 exams.",
    "ANTH 242 is a standard introductory biology class on the basics of human evolutionary biology. As someone who did not really like biology in high school, I found ANTH 242 to be a clear, easy to understand, and accessible science credit. Claudia is a very reasonable professor and her teaching is clear and understandable. This class had a low to medium work load, but definitely challenged me at times. The weekly readings and discussion question are very manageable, however the midterm and final exams cover quite a bit of material and definitely require a fair amount of preparation. However, overall the class was pretty good. I found that it's evolutionary perspective made learning about human biology much more interesting than when I was in high school. I would definitely recommend this class to anybody interested in the material, or who is looking for a manageable science credit where they can walk away having learned a significant amount about a new field.",
    "This is a great course and professor Valeggia makes it 100% worth it. The workload is light but make sure to study for the final and midterm at least a few days in advance.",
    "A general introduction to the field, with topics ranging from climate adaptation to reproductive ecology.",
    "Do you want to actually learn something applicable and interesting from a science class. Take this course. I convinced 5 of my friends to take this class and they have told me that it was the best part of their semester.",
    "Would definitely recommend!",
    "A very doable science credit that's also really interesting! Great class to take if you want to better understand how our evolution has shaped (and continues to shape) our everyday lives.",
    "Though definitely not a gutty science credit, you'll walk out of the class feeling like you learned something useful. If you're at all interested in how genes and the environment affect humanity, this is the class for you. Also, if you've never dabbled in anthropology, I think this is a great course that gives you a look into the research methods used by the field.",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in anthropology, ethical research, biology, medicine, or evolutionary theory. Claudia is an amazing professor who knows how to teach big concepts in a way that is interesting and engaging, even in a big lecture. She really cares about her students, and makes sure that she is teaching in a way that avoids strict memorization and rather focuses on really learning the material. This means that the assignments and tests that she gives to students are extremely fair and very useful. I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in it!",
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "A great class if you're interested in how humans fit into the bigger picture of evolution and natural selection.",
    "This is such a great class! I took it expecting it to just serve as my last science credit and instead it was truly one of the best academic experiences I have had outside my major."
