   "comments": [
    "You should take this course if you have any interest in the theoretical underpinnings of the democratic process, and even if you don't, you should consider it a civic obligation. Professor Kirshner is an outstanding seminar leader who is very good at teasing out nuanced responses. Let me repeat this: Professor Kirshner is very good at leading sections. You will have an opportunity to participate, and the discussion will not be dominated by 1-2 people. You will leave class with a sense of awe at the thinkers and topics before you. The workload in this course is extremely manageable, the subject is fascinating, and the professor is great. You will enjoy going to class each week.",
    "Examines democracy through the lens of opposition rather than agreements.I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend taking this course but be warned that the amount of time required to understand the readings is long.",
    "The syllabus was off, but it was an overall good class. I would definitely recommend it because I am taking away a bit from this class. I definitely appreciate opposition more. And, in many ways, have acquired a different perspective\/interpretation on how I view the world.",
    "A good course if interested on how democracy is challenged on a number of levels including civil society and whether such challenges are justifiable. The instructor is tough but leads solid discussions."
