    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Toni Dorfman is engaging, quirky, and deep. Homework is non-academic, unconventional, and extremely rewarding. Anyone who is interested in theater (directors, actors, designers) will find this class highly informative and inspirational. You will also undoubtedly make friends with the other members of the class and learn a lot from them as well. If you're up for some creative challenges that will change you as a director and a person, this class is for you.",
    "You should really take this if you are interested in the practical side of theater as an actor or a director. There were all different skill levels, and the main criterion seemed to be creativity. Just be aware that there is always work to do, and so you always have a lot of little assignments. But, definitely a worthwhile course."
