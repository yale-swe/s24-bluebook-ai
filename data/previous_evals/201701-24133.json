   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the state of childcare in the US, but more importantly, I learned how seminars can be collaborative, positive environments. Janna and Jessica really helped me to see how to foster a welcoming environment where people can disagree respectfully and learn through the process of discussion.",
    "This class was phenomenal! I learned so much and they had the most reaasobable expectations of students. You were actually able to engage in the reading because you could actually do them. I was so pleased!",
    "I learned all about the importance of early childcare, the issues surrounding it, innovative policy ideas, and other ideas on how to expand accessibility and afforadability of early childcare.",
    "We learned so much about childcare policy and practice in the US.",
    "This course is reading-heavy so I further developed my text analysis skills. Within a text, I had to effectively gather what the author's main argument for childcare is, examples of why the author believes so, any evidence against that argument, and then decide whether or not I agreed with the author. In addition, the texts also advocated for exisiting childcare program structures and I also evaluated whether or not I believed they were effective. Not only that, in discussion I had to practice articulating my ideas clearly and concisely IN RESPONSE to what someone else had already said or asked. This was a big challenge for me and although I am still working on this, I believe 225 was a great environment to practice this in.",
    "This class teaches you so much about child care and society and will make you super passionate about child care! It's a really good overview into lots of aspects of child care, from policy to economics to psychology to education! It's also quite a bit of writing and you write a long proposal at the end, which you get a lot of help with.",
    "In this class, I learned both about the crucial developmental period for children ages 0 to 5: I was not aware of its importance, and was able to learn about the implications of this period for a child's future. In addition, I learned about how to frame child care policy issues within an economic framework that highlights the gains of investing in child care while also being aware of how this can take a problematic utilitarian turn. Furthermore, I learned about federal and state initiatives that intertwine with child care accessibility and affordability issues."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, Profs Wagner and Sager did a great job of supporting students, providing interetsting\/valuable readings, and facilitating class discussion. At times, however, the course was a little disorganized. In particular, I would have liked to have assignment sheets with rubrics and guidelines\/due dates on course table. Still, they were great about providing all the necessary information in class.",
    "LOVE THIS CLASS. Jenna and Jessica are so kind and run the seminar better than any other instructor I have had. They provide just enough knowledge but also let us talk things out!",
    "This is a great course! Strengths are the important and interesting material and classroom discussions, along with a really welcoming atmosphere that Jessica and Janna create.",
    "Janna and Jessica care so much about the material and impart that papssion to their students. The strengths of the course are thinking about early childcare through so many different vantage points (pscyhology, sociology, policy). The weaknesses is that some of those lenses weren't quite as iinterested (at least to me, but I still think they were important to know!)",
    "Having every student lead discussion once was a great way to foster community feeling in the class, as well as to ensure grasp of the material. Janna and Jessica teach so well together, and balance the class so neatly between practice and policy. All in all, such a wonderful class.",
    "Strengths: The profs are amaaaaazing. They are so knowledgable, but allow the discussion to be student led and student driven. However, they will definitely interject and clarify if we mention something confusing\/ that might not be true. The class environment was conducive to engaging discussion. Janna and Jessica made sure to engage as many students as possible. Weaknesses: I wouldn't say this is a full weakness, but the readings were very long. And sometimes I couldn't get through them all. So I appreciate that Jessica often asked for someone to summarize the gist of the reading before we started discussing, because even if I didn't finish, I could still try to connect what had been summarized to the readings I WAS able to get through.",
    "The course is mostly reading and writing based, so the workload is pretty heavy (especially if you are really invested in the class, like most people!) and can get monotonous. It's really important to plan well! Otherwise, this class is amazing! You'll have so many good discussions and conversations, and Jess and Janna are so kind and knowledgeable. The overall environment of the class is really supportive and diverse.",
    "This course did an amazing job of having a clear set of readings that were specifically assigned to answer questions pertaining to a specific topic. Furthermore, Jess and Janna were so great about involving the perspectives of all of the students in the class while ensuring that all of the readings were covered in detail. One thing that could be improved upon would be to speak even more about how All Our Kin consciously implements the lessons that we learn in the classroom in the work that they do in the New Haven community.",
    "This course was so wonderful. I hesitate to include any criticism besides that readings eventually got a bit tedious Long reports, though important to learn how to read, didn't always feel like the best way to take in information, and some weeks included readings that overlapped almost entirely. So I'd suggest some tweaking of the syllabusbut otherwise, class structure (activities and small group discussion, as well as whole-group discussion) was wonderful, and I learned a ton."

   "comments": [
    "would recommend to students interested in grappling with education policy, and particularly child care policy. I learned a lot, especially from other students and our discussions and from hearing everyone's insights on policy. readings were fascinating and engaging, and I feel like the work and discussions were meaningful and fulfilling. I gained a lot from the entire experience and feel like this is overall a great course!",
    "Take this class!! Janna and Jessica are knowledgable, welcoming, and great at facilitating conversation. This class was the most positive classroom environment I've been in at Yale, and I learned so much about childcare in the US. Definitely worth it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Such a warm environment!",
    "Absolutely take this course! The professors and lovely and the workload isn't that bad. You'll learn a lot about early childhood education, and it's really pleasant!",
    "Yes! Take this class if you are at all interested in early childcare or polcy or equity.",
    "Definitely take this class if you get a chance - Janna and Jessica are amazing instructors who actually work in the field and therefore know things that no textbook could teach you. Incidentally, they're also wonderful people.",
    "ABSOLUTELY recommend! This is a great course about the complexities of childcare in the US, and Janna and Jessica are incredible - so smart and so caring. The weekly snacks also definitely made it a highlight of my course schedule.",
    "YES YES YES!! We need more great minds thinking about childcare issues.",
    "Yes!!!! This is a great class and you learn so much about child care! The discussions are great, the professors are great, and the workload is manageable. The class only meets once a week but is still a significant time commitment. Definitely recommend for anyone even the tiniest bit interested in learning the complexities of child care!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to any student interested in how crucial child care is for upper- and low-income families. While child care policy is not always the center of the welfare discussion, it should be: providing immersive child care for children (esp. those in environments that will not positively foster their development) can solve many of the issues that we see juveniles experiencing as they pertain to the school-to-prison-pipeline and other risks of being in under-resourced communities."
