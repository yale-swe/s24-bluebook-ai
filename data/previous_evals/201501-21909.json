   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you can, take it junior year because it'll give you a super strong skeleton for a thesis. It's a ton of work though so be ready for that.",
    "The class is organized to get an understanding of real economic models and empirical approaches, and it teaches you all what you should have learned in Econometrics. In that regard, it is extremely useful if you plan to write a senior essay (take it as a junior, if you can). I find that the structure of the class was a bit monotonous and that made some classes a bit dry. This class is not that much about policy as much as it is about learning about the economic models and empirical approaches that other authors use. The professor says that in the first class (it is about Latam because there is a lot of data and papers from there), but I still was surprised by the end when I did not learn much about policy--I did learn an incredible amount about econometrics.",
    "Take it only if you're interested in the econometric analysis of human capital issues (the course has little emphasis on macro-issues and almost no macro-conversation) Pros: - Great introduction to human capital issues in Latin America - Great introduction to econometric analysis of human capital issues - Develops student ability to think critically about complex economic models and econometric methods Cons: - Too much reading and weekly work",
    "HCLA is a great course for senior econ majors or anyone with a similar econ background, including statistics and econometrics for reading economic papers. Even if you have no experience learning about human capital (basically education and healthcare) in Latin America, youll enjoy this class if it sounds even vaguely interesting. We read 2-4 papers every week and write weekly reading responses, and a group of students presents the papers for the week. Then over the course of the semester, you write a research proposal that is like a mini-thesis. We have an empirical approaches quiz, and a poster session at the end of the semester to show off your proposal work. Youll work hard but learn a lot in this class. One of my favorite classes at Yale if not my favorite definitely take it!!",
    "This class was the best! As Prof. McKee said, some key things you'll learn about: (1) economics of human capital in Latin America, (2) how to read and understand papers in development economics, (3) economic methods in these papers, (4) how to design your own research proposal. Apart from interesting material, Doug makes this class. He works so hard with us to make every session engaging and to make sure we are actually learning as much as we can from what we've read and discussed. It was great to end my senior year with this.",
    "The class was great-- would recommend. You learn to read econ papers and actually understand the methods, and then write your own research proposal with plenty of guidance and discussion. McKee is very helpful and supportive, and a very chill prof.",
    "Just take this class. Take it. Not taking EHCLA is like finding the last water-filled cactus in the Sahara and not drinking from it.",
    "This is an extremely econometrics heavy class. You will struggle of you have not taken metrics 2. I had a really rough time with a lot of the empirical methods and metrics used (you will read three econometric papers a week and do worksheets on them). Doug is a really great professor and will do his best to teach metrics but this class is really large and it's hard to get 1on1 help sometimes (and I personally often felt intimidated to ask for econometrics help because everyone in the class seemed to understand it very well). This class attracts a very specific type of Economics or Global Affairs major type of student.. Professor was great though.",
    "Take it, and try to take it as a junior since it will really help your senior thesis. I believe that this course is not offered next time, but surely take McKee's other class - Economics of Aging - if that's the case. You will not regret the hard work you put in.",
    "This is a great class! The workload is manageable and the papers are interesting. Going into it, I was concerned that, having taken many development econ classes, I would have already read many of the papers, but the vast majority were new to me. Professor McKee is also wonderful, definitely one of my favorites! He is very friendly, creates a good class environment and is quite helpful, especially when it comes to the final project.",
    "Best econ class I've taken. Definitely a lot of work and the research proposal was likely the hardest and most comprehensive paper I've ever written at Yale. But it's worth it if you balance your schedule around it because the class sessions are not dry like so many other econ classes",
    "I think that this course is extremely helpful if you want to learn how to write a true economics paper--one that is not just a review of existing literature or a personal critique of a specific development program. Of all the economics classes I have taken at Yale, this course is bar none the most relevant to real-world experience and taught me more than several other classes combined. Take this course if you want to have a great senior spring and learn from one of the funniest most caring professors in the Economics department.",
    "Absolutely. Amazing instructor, amazing subject.'",
    "This course is incredibly helpful. Not only it provides a great overview of human capital (education, health, etc) but also includes an extremely useful review of econometrics methods. If you don't know how to read economic papers this is your best opportunity to learn properly. TAKE IT!"
