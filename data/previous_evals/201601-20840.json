    "For a heritage speaker of Spanish, you will learn academic Spanish that you probably haven't learned before. It will be hard at first to accept that you have spoken Spanish incorrectly for most of your life.",
    "I'd recommend it to any student who has had Spanish spoken in the home, and who hopes to master it! It gives you the tools and confidence necessary to make huge improvements and eventually master the language.",
    "Take this class. You will learn so much, both about your language and your identity.",
    "Spanish 142 is a great course to take for heritage speakers who really want to get a better grammatical grasp of the language. Not only did the class drastically improve my writing, but it also tremendously improved my fluency, vocabulary, and confidence when speaking in spanish.",
    "If you are a heritage speaker and have any sort of insecurities about the language whether it is grammar or being comfortable speaking it, take this class! The work is very manageable and a lot of interesting cultural and important topics are covered. The professor is very friendly and always ready to help and you will definitely feel much more confident in your abilities with the language.",
    "Heritage Speakers Part II is WONDERFUL!! Professor Alexandrov is the best and this class is totally worth taking!"
