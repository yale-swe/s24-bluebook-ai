   "comments": [
    "Very interesting and awesome readings. However, there was one person in our class who was condescending and ruined many a discussion; often it was hard to get a word in edgewise. Still, great class and great prof, and much better if you get a respectful class.",
    "You get what you sign up for: a class about some of the most important heresies (mostly religious) in western history. It was very good and I would definitely recommend it. (It would be particularly good for a non-SO person because the material is very understandable.)",
    "If you have any interest in learning about the history of religion I highly recommend this class. This is by no means an easy class, but it really gives you a lot of information.",
    "Great professor and interesting material. The dynamic of the class is crucial to the overall experience of the course. Not an extremely demanding course but it does provoke thinking and the readings are good.",
    "Take it. Without hesitation, without reservation, without equivocation.HIST 008 takes you through Western intellectual dissent from Jesus Christ to the modern American Culture Wars, often in the words of the heretics themselves. Much of the course is focused on religious dissent, such as the Protestant Reformation, but figures like Galileo and movements like Impressionism are also featured. It's a seminar, and you'll only get the best out of the course if you're willing to participate in discussions, and to do so with good humor, patience, and an open mind. Your beliefs will be challenged: this is a class where you are encouraged to think (and say) the unthinkable, and this is what gives it its appeal.Professor Eire is a brilliant, wonderful, charming human being, a fountain of knowledge, and a great teacher. The workload is completely manageable (although the reading can be a bit on the heavy side) and the assignments, as a rule, allow you the opportunity to pursue your own interests.I have only had one semester at Yale, but this has been my favorite course thus far, and I am skeptical of any prospect of that changing any time soon. Take it.",
    "I would only if they are in to studying religious heresies, because that is the main focus. Also it's a lot of reading, so it requires a lot of time and there aren't many chances to reap the reward of keeping up.",
    "Essential Heresies is an interesting class. At first, it seemed very challenging to me,but things become much clearer as the semester wears on. Prof. Eire is an absolutely brilliant professor - he's a lovely grader to have. The work in this class is not that high intensity - you have 1 midterm, which is one book and then a final, which is again on 1 book. You also have a review essay, but you get a lot of time for it, and extensions, if you need them !There is a fair bit of reading, but you'll be fine even if you don't do it all",
    "Essential Heresies requires a lot of reading (about a book per week plus supplemental PDF documents on Classes v2), but it is enjoyable and engaging reading. The course is challenging in how it makes you think about Western history but not overwhelming in the scope of the material it covers. I would recommend this course to someone who likes to read and learn more about Western heritage, or simply to anyone who likes to probe into topics that many of us glance over or take for granted. For me, the most interesting part of the course and the subject of my review essay was the history of the early church (after Jesus's death and Resurrection until the Nicene creed in 325). It was fascinating and gave me the motivation to read three scholarly books on the subject.",
    "Essential Heresies is a great class to take even if you have only a passing interest in western history and religious history. Although the workload is generally pretty intense (A book a week [200-300pgs]and one 10-15 page paper), it's worth it for the experience. Carlos Eire is a great professor who knows how to teach this material. You will come away from the class having learned, which doesn't always happen, even at Yale. This class is a rare opportunity, take it if you can.",
    "Take it if you're interested in approaching religious studies in a thoughtful way and aren't afraid of some dense reading!",
    "Professor Eire is wonderful! He's very nice and understanding, and was happy to give me an extension on my final paper. He even shortened our final exam because he was impressed by the papers we'd written! I also really like how unbiased he was towards the material, especially when we discussed the Bible. I was afraid that as a Christian, I would be offended by many of the things we discussed in class, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I couldn't discern Professor Eire's position on the issues we discussed. He let the students do most of the talking, which is much more engaging than listening to a lecture. Also, in terms of workload, there really isn't a whole lot. There's a short presentation, a midterm, a research paper, then a final. That's it. Only thing that is time consuming would be the readings--generally a book or two a week--and believe me, you do NOT want to get behind on them. I spent the better part of reading week catching up on 4 of the books I hadn't even touched. All in all, keep up with the readings and participate in class discussions, and you're good!",
    "This class is wonderful! The topics are fascinating and the discussions are often incredibly insightful. It's also quite easy--everyone will likely do quite well. Professor Eiere is also supremely intelligent and, as importantly, really, really nice."
