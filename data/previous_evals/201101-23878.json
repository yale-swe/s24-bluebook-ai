    "Physics is just terrible for me, no matter at what level. Professor Zeller is not a very good professor. Wish we would have done a lot more example problems in class, but often you were left to teach yourself how do solve problems and apply the theories we learned in class.",
    "Yes",
    "Professor Zeller was kind and passionate about physics but had trouble \"dumbing\" down concepts and organizing his board work for an introductory physics course. Aka most of your learning will be self-directed. However, the tests are fair and straightforward and you get to make your own formula sheets to use for the tests so if you put in decent effort you should be fine.",
    "WAY better that Physics 171. Trust me. It\u0092s nothing special though.",
    "do not take this class unless you need a physics requirement",
    "Only take if you need for premed or the physics major",
    "This course is a general overview of E and M, with some Optics and some SHM. Its not all that interesting, but if you have to take it, well, then you really don't have a choice, do you?",
    "This is a good course for general physics review and instruction. It is a step up from the AP curriculum even though it too is for the most part, non-calc based. You cover a lot of material and is actually interesting. It is very problem-solving based and to understand it well, requires attending classes and doing problems. Professor Zeller requires attendance through the use of clickers so its hard to skip out. Overall, its a good course that requires more prep than one would expect"
