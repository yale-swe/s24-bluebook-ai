    "Introduction to proof-writing skills, applying theorems in deriving additional corollaries, better understanding of linear algebra",
    "This class forces you to learn how to write rigorous mathematical proofs, a skill which I had not previously learned. The important takeaways from this class, besides the proof stuff, are learning how to deal with matricies, eigen-things, diagonalization, and innerproducts.",
    "Good introduction to proof-based math and linear algebra",
    "You talk about fields, vector spaces, bases, etc, and then you zoom in on transformations and talk about eigenvalues and eigenvectors eventually. Finally, you talk about inner products.",
    "I learned how to write rigorous proofs and think more creatively.",
    "A solid, proof-based introduction to linear algebra",
    "This class helped me build a strong theoretical foundation for any future math I decide to pursue. In addition, I gained confidence and comfort with my ability to write and understand proofs.",
    "I learned the fundamental definitions and theorems of linear algebra. This course was especially helpful for learning how to write proofs and gain more depth in mathematical thinking.",
    "Totally changed the way I think about math and proofs.",
    "This course did a good job teaching the fundamentals of linear algebra. Sometimes the conceptual components (about why things are true) were lacking, but overall the course was able to introduce the important principles of linear algebra.",
    "How to go about proving theorems by induction and otherwise, and just generally getting more comfortable with pure math that isn't always based in numbers.",
    "Gained a great deal of mathematical maturity and refined my proof writing.",
    "I developed a foundational knowledge of linear algebra -- I loved learning about matrices and how to manipulate them to hold and represent information and different transformations (like reflections\/rotations\/etc, also solving systems of equations). I also developed some skill and confidence in developing and writing mathematical proofs. This element of the course seemed less emphasized toward the end, but I appreciated the practice. I also learned computational strategies like using Gaussian elimination to find the inverse matrix. However, if youre looking to spend a lot of time on geometric visualizations and applications, this isnt the class for you eg we didnt discuss\/oractics what kinds of matrix transformations represent rotations, reflections, etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were that the course was very clear in what one had to know in order to do well in the class; improvements could be done in changing the time of the class, as many students were too tired to fully engage during lecture.",
    "It was fine.",
    "The course had too much material to be covered in detail well, meaning the first half was well explained and explored, but the second half (naturally, the more difficult half of the class) felt rushed. The material was interesting, and the course progressed naturally, there was just too much to learn in one semester.",
    "Class was taught very well by Kalina Mincheva (good at explaining, very patient, answers questions during lecture so it's not one-sided), but pace accelerated ridiculously right after the midterm because we were behind. I'm sure this is a problem she will fix in next terms. Problem sets (~6 problems) and midterm\/final are very doable if you're patient and work at it. Great textbook also.",
    "The course was okay... the psets couldve followed more from what we learned though.",
    "This class did a good job at covering the most important material from the book, but did not cover all the proofs of the theorems.",
    "The course was organized and predictable, the homework assignments were difficult but reasonable, and Professor Mincheva was always willing to explain or elaborate further. However, as the course went on things started getting a little less organized (namely, the lectures started getting a little harder to follow, though part of that could be attributed to the more difficult content towards the end of the course). Also, there was less motivation to start homework assignments earlier because there were very often typos in the problem sets that would only be corrected two days or so before they were due.",
    "This course does an excellent job proving each concept in detail and building harder concepts based on simpler ones. The homework was always challenging, but interesting and reasonable. In addition, the professor and the peer tutor were always willing to explain concepts outside of class (and even outside of office hours) one-on-one. It was always possible to get additional help, and the help was always valuable. The only weakness of the course was that a few of the harder topics at the very end were sped through very quickly. Perhaps spending slightly less time earlier in the course could help save time to think about these topics later.",
    "The main strength of this course is its rigor. While we covered the first few chapters of the Friedberg textbook in depth, my impression was that the last few topics were a bit rushed. This imbalance is the only thing I would change in this course.",
    "very difficult but generally manageable. Classroom could have potentially been more engaging but we had a lot of material to cover so there wasn't much time. The pace of the class was a little uneven.",
    "Strengths: material is interesting, exams (especially the midterm and the quizzes) are not too difficult, professor is super sweet and cares about her students Weaknesses: the course was somewhat disorganized, we spent so much time on the first chapter that we had to speed through the rest of the book, some problem sets have tedious problems",
    "This course rewarded coming to lecture to find out what the important theorems are, and then working by oneself or with the peer tutor to figure out why they are true and why they are important. A great conceptual emphasis in lecture would have been helpful. But the assigned homework did a great job of forcing one to apply the theorems. Sometimes the homework emphasized proofs which were trivial or unimportant. It would have improved the course to place greater emphasis on how to do proofs, and what kinds of proofs there are. For example, many of the homework questions required proof by induction, which was something that students basically just had to figure out by themselves or with the peer tutor.",
    "Great professor, great TAs. Not much to complain about.",
    "The course builds skills in an easy to grasp manner.",
    "This class is strong at the beginning when the focus is on fundamentals and we actually do every proof that we rely on. It gets weaker when it moves on to the more advanced parts of linear algebra. A lot of proofs are skipped, and I started to feel like I didn't understand why a lot of things were true, and instead just had to trust that they were. There are also some concepts introduced late where the purpose is never explained. For example, I know what an adjunct is and can calculate one, but I have absolutely no idea why I would ever want to do that; I don't know what an adjunct is actually for.",
    "I really enjoyed the beginning of the course especially -- our concepts and proofs seemed to build upon each other comprehensively, and that made the material more intuitive and satisfying. Toward the end of the course, there started to be more 'We can't prove this with our current knowledge, so we'll just assume it' that together with an increased focus on computations (e.g. eigenvectors and eigenvalues) led to me feeling more lost and dissatisfied. That said, Kalina is great and really cares about her students (and our peer tutor, Joy, was fantastic) and I still ultimately enjoyed and appreciated the course. The course is fast-paced, and spending time with the Friedberg textbook really helped me prepare for the final exam (whereas, my class notes were sufficient for the midterm). Despite the fast pace, I appreciated the class's structure. The problem sets generally combined some computational exercises to help us practice concepts and proofs that required time to think and tinker -- these were often tricky. In contrast, the exams were relatively straightforward (required mastery of definitions, theorems), which felt fair given the time constraints. Also, the homework, though time-consuming, was not nearly as much so as previous 225 professors' apparently were. I can elect this class toward my major but do not require it and essentially took this class because I wanted to learn mathematical analysis, writing proofs, and learn some foundational math I also just wanted to give math in general another try after hating 120 as a first-year. The demanding but doable coursework made this course accessible \/ justifiable to me on top of my other coursework, which is a huge asset in a discipline that many students see as exclusive\/prohibitive."

   "comments": [
    "Meh. Not really. Take MATH 222; it's more practical.",
    "Yes, if you genuinely like math and are willing to spend time on PSets and understanding the material outside class.",
    "Yes - this was my first proof-based math class and I'm not a math person, but this class was well within reach and I enjoyed it very much. Read the textbook, do the problem sets without help first (very possible to do on your own), ask questions. Linear algebra is great!",
    "Yes, linear algebra is so important to classes later on if you're in STEM (unless you're in pure bio, but even then still helpful).",
    "Yes! MATH 225 was my first proof-based math class, and I'm glad I took it over 222; my previous experience with application-based math courses (ENAS 151, 194) was that they were manageable but mostly plug-and-chug. I can't really remember much at all from those courses. This class, on the other hand, introduced me both to linear algebra and to mathematical proof-writing in general. Professor Mincheva did a good job, given that it was her first (?) time teaching this particular class at Yale, and I imagine that a lot of the kinks in the class we experienced this year (typos in problem sets, less organized lectures towards the end of the class) would be mostly or fully fixed by next year. As hard it is to get up for a 9am, make sure you try to make every class - like Prof. Mincheva says on the first day, it becomes very difficult to catch up even with a friend's notes. And beyond that, make sure you get yourself a pset group asap. As long as you're ready to invest a little more time and effort, this class is great for what it advertises.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I was nervous to take a theoretical math class (rather than an applied one) but I was very glad I did so. This class had time and space for me to learn how to write proofs, and it was a great introduction to the more theoretical math world. I would say that this class taught me a way of thinking, more than simply new math content. This was an extremely welcome break after calculus and other high school math.",
    "This course, despite the heavy workload and its time intesiveness, is very rewarding. I have gained more depth in mathematical thinking: understanding and applying definitions and theorems has been made much easier for me after taking this course. I personally took 225 to attain a better comprehension of econometrics, and was incredibly useful in that respect. I would thus highly recommend this course for any student interested in economics and data analysis.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed it and got a lot out of it. Even if I'm not sure I did as well as I would have liked.",
    "There is not much time for examples and consequences of theorems in class so to do well prepare to spend extra time out of classless info material from the book.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is much better than 222 and is not as hard as people say it is. This course is also MUCH more interesting than 120. The proofs in the course helped me gain a deeper understanding of the material. Also, because 225 is the more rigorous linear course, it seemed like everyone in the class was genuinely interested in math (fewer premeds\/econs). I recommend this course for any student who's willing to put in the work (which is not really that much).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the material is very interesting and the Professor Mincheva does a good job of introducing all the important concepts of linear algebra. It will require a bit of individual work to really understand the theorems, but this is worth it because the subject is interesting.",
    "Definitely. Professor Mincheva is a very personable as well as knowledgeable professor who kept the work of this course from seeming like a chore.",
    "Yes! Highly recommend this course. It is a fun and challenging math course and you learn so much.",
    "This class will be good if the professor is good, and vise versa. Several friends of mine recommended it to me (instead of 222) because they said it will be slightly harder but also more rewarding and I will feel as if I am learning a lot. I did not get this sense at all, mostly due to the fact that my professor was not great.",
    "Yes! Despite some frustrations towards the ending (I love Kalina, but her explanations seemed less clear to me toward the end of the course), I really enjoyed the class and appreciate the skills, knowledge, and confidence I gained from it. Some advice : find a study group, at least for discussing solutions (policy: pset collaboration is encouraged, but you must write up your own solution). To this end, go to peer tutor office hours! The camaraderie and collaboration are hugely helpful. That said, actually do the problems yourself and spend significant time thinking about\/ vaguely playing with the proofs before asking for help; youll get a lot more out of the course if you rigorously practice this kind of analysis. Also, I found the best way to prepare for the two quizzes (not a big deal) and exams (pretty big deal, final was harder, but both were fair and relied a lot on definitions, theorems, and T\/F) was to reread and rewrite\/re explain theorems and definitions we went over in class. The Friedberg text is pretty dense but I found it helpful in preparation for the final; Kalina pretty much goes by the book in terms of topics, which was helpful to organizing my studying."
