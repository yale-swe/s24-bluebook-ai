    "Great course. Overall, the structure is relaxed and I learned a lot about infection prevention in the healthcare setting. Drs. Dembry and Banach are extremely knowledgable on the subject matter and are great instructors. The case studies we did in class were an effective way of getting us to apply the material to a realistic setting. I don't have any complaints.",
    "I enjoyed this course. It is not as intensive as some of the other upper level EMD electives which was nice to have as a second year student, and I still felt like I got a lot out of it. Healthcare epi is an important topic and we cover a lot of aspects of HAIs that I feel is good to know for someone entering public health practice even if it isn't focused on HAIs, since outbreak investigations and microbiology testing and infection prevention are important to know in general in infectious disease epi. The homework assignments and final exam are fair and good assessments of what we discussed in class.",
    "It was a good class - I wish it had been more participatory though. The professors tried to encourage participation, but it never really worked. Going through more of the case studies as a group would have been interesting. They gave great feedback on the homeworks. It was a great and practical overview of the topic.",
    "I found the lectures very informative and interesting. However, the homework questions tended to be a bit drawn-out. Perhaps in the future, the homework questions could be somewhat shorter and more direct."

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry is a very knowledgeable woman, a great instructor, and an overall cool person. She is great at getting us to think critically and probing us with questions to contextualize the material.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Both Dr. Dembry and Dr. Banach are really nice and good professors! They also bring in a lot of guest speakers. they are very knowledgeable and receptive to student interests.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Great! Interesting presenter. Very organized. Tried to encourage participation, but the class resisted.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry is an amazing instructor! I really enjoyed how she brought multiple perspectives together in approaching issues facing healthcare and infection prevention."

    "A very useful class if you will be working in a healthcare setting, whether as an infection preventionist, a hospital epidemiologist or a medical professional. The workload is very reasonable. This is an overall great class that I would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about this subject matter. The two professors worked really well together and each brought something unique to the course. They are both approachable and provided timely feedback.",
    "I would recommend this course to any second year EMD student.",
    "Good class, reasonable amount of work, no need to do the readings.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to those interested in medicine. However, it may not be a great fit for those interested in working in health departments or other sectors outside of the hospital."
