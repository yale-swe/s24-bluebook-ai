    "Yes",
    "GLBL 901 is an introduction to international relations theories. The course explores the main theories of international relations, offering criticisms and inviting analysis of each theory that is explored and application of the theories. Yes, I would recommend GLBL 901 to anyone who is interested in the topic. It's a great introduction to the material and understanding the way scholars have been thinking in this field. It presents a good challenge without being inaccessible.",
    "I will recommend for those who seek to delve into the theoretical aspect of the international society.",
    "GLBL 901 is a course that covers the basic tenets of IR theory and its applications to current foreign policy challenges. I would recommend the course to others, especially those who want to understand the theoretical underpinnings of international policy dynamics.",
    "Not only would I recommend the course, but I frankly do not understand why some version of this course is not a core requirement for Global Affairs graduate students. I feel that the information taught in this course is more essential and fundamental than the topics covered in 801, 802, and 803 (although I did enjoy those courses and do not want this comment to be construed as a critique against those instructors).",
    "A great course if lone want to learn more about how to apply theorh to empirics. Also a very relevant course for anyone who has ambitions to ever deal with any kind of IR policy making.",
    "Good introduction to IR theory and a great way to learn to structure an argument and write a concise memo."

    "This course allows me to think about foreign policy with big-picture thinking.",
    "This course will be directly applicable to my next job teaching International Relations. It has provided the foundation to understanding the IR theories I will be teaching as well as applying them to current events in a way that will make the dense theory more interesting to students.",
    "This course greatly helped me in my knowledge of the discipline. It has provided a basis that will help me in my approach to all the works I will read in the future.",
    "It was the first time I had ever experienced the great combination of theory and real world problems. It is astoninshing that I neve rhad experienced it, but I am happy to have done so now. A great course relevant to anybody dealing with IR.",
    "This was a great overview on IR theory, definitely learned a lot and this course has increased my interest in the theoretical components behind policy\/decisionmaking."
