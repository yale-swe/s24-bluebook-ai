   "comments": [
    "Interesting but tough.",
    "If you've taken intermediate microeconomics with Samuelson, you'll already know a lot of the material. It's mostly intro stuff with a few interesting models that are glossed over.",
    "If you want a gut econ class that you don't go to, take it. Else, no.",
    "The material is overall very interesting but unfortunately Professor Washington is quite uninspiring to the point I stopped going to lecture. You can read the book a couple of day s before the midterms and you will be fine, which probably means that it is a waste of your college education.",
    "ECON 275 is about very relevant information. The material is interesting but the class is not. The class is really easy, and if you're motivated enough to learn the material yourself, this is an easy econ credit! However, a lot of the times I do feel like I wasted a credit taking this class because lectures were so pointless and no body really takes this class seriously.",
    "If you want an easy-ish Econ class and you're willing to sit through boring lectures, do it.",
    "Nope.",
    "The material is really interesting and the book is great, but the lectures and class are actually pretty unnecessary\/boring. If you're interested in the topic, I suggest taking the course and just reading the book--it'll teach you everything you need to know for the problem sets and tests.",
    "It is what it says: an introduction to public economics\/public finance. The course is split up into three units: one is about externalities and public goods (and also just basic concepts and tools of public econ), the next is about social insurance programs like medicare and social security, and the third is about taxation. All these topics are things you hear discussed all the time in the news and in everyday life, and it's worth learning about them at some point. This course was a convenient way to do so, but don't expect it to be the most riveting lecture ever. I ended up learning a lot from the textbook, which is excellent, and the TA's, Lint and Jamin, were also really helpful.",
    "This is a well taught, interesting class. Washington does lecture from the book, but it is so well written and comprehensive why wouldn't she?",
    "Yes, take it. This class is great. The lectures and material are all repetition of the textbook, so you will not learn anything you couldn't have gotten from reading the textbook. Because of this fact, the class is pretty chill.",
    "I'm glad I took it. the problem sets can take forever, (a few days), and you'll need to work on them in a group to get by, but they aren't the worst. If you do all the problem sets, you should be fine for exams. the class follows the textbook so perfectly, you'll never need to attend the lecture to get an A on the exams. its the most straightforward class i've taken at yale yet. great for the econ\/polisci double majors because you can use it for both distributions",
    "Ok class, just read the book and slides and you're good",
    "This course discusses some interesting concepts and is not particularly difficult. If you want to take an alright Economics course that applies some of the concepts you studied in other micro courses, I would recommend it. You will teach most of the material to yourself, but it's not a terrible course.",
    "Very interesting, but like any econ class, it requires time, reading, and understanding. There is not much of a curve in this class, so really understand all of the topics.",
    "If you're an econ. major, you will likely find this class easy to the point of being boring.",
    "Lint, the TF, was awesome and pretty cute.",
    "I recommend this class. It changed me from a Republican into a Democrat. Take that for amazing.",
    "Interesting material, although lectures boring. Pretty easy.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to know the nitty-gritty of econ.",
    "For econ majors this is an extremely easy class for the major. If you understand how politics work at all you are basically set for the semester. It seemed like PoliSci majors had a much harder time in the class as they did not really understand the economics behind the politics. The lectures are fun and interesting, though not necessary to attend. The work load is light and grades should be quite high.",
    "Anyone interested in the economic rationale of government policy should take this class \u0096 it is not too much work, and you really learn a lot that you can take with you for practical daily life. This course is a pretty standard course in public finance taught basically in a directly-from-textbook manner. You learn a lot about really interesting policy issues such as welfare, insurance, taxes, and externalities, and it combines really well the mathematical vs. the qualitative aspects of economics. The textbook is REALLY good (probably one of the best I\u0092ve read) and basically all you need to do is read the textbook to learn things. There are only 6 problem sets (1\/2 weeks), 2 midterms and a final (all worth 25% each).",
    "No. Only take this is you need the class for a major.",
    "Material was easy but it was extremely boring and hard to get a good grade. I say no.",
    "This course is a great course if you never want to go to class and do well on exams. All you have to do is read 1\/3 of the textbook for every exam and you'll do well. You won't get much out of it, but it is an easy econ credit and the book is well written.",
    "Not really. Just buy the book and read it!",
    "this isn't exactly the most fun class, but some material (like taxes and stuff) are important for the future. the professor is a little annoying since she acts like she is better than everyone. not too difficult though.",
    "A decent Econ credit, learned quite a bit about our government but the material was often dry.",
    "Yes. take it.",
    "Avoidable",
    "Ok class. A little boring, but read the book, its interesting. Take it if you're an Econ major looking for a credit.",
    "Take it if you want to learn interesting material that every educated citizen should know. Lectures are ok, and problem sets are challenging and very focused on microeconomics. The tests are doable though. If you're a poli sci major, make sure you're very comfortable with economics.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to Econ majors because you'll find all the material very interesting. Professor Washington taught everything in a clear and understandable way, but wasn't particularly inspiring. I'd still recommend taking this class with her or with any teacher, though. The problem sets are long but are only every other week, and the textbook is really good. I learned a lot of information in this class that I will use on a daily basis, like social security, taxation, insurance, risk-taking, unemployment insurance, education...etc.Overall a great class.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this class if you're an underclassman and not if you've taken a lot of Econ already. It's a good survey of a lot of topics and the basics of the math behind it. There are fewer psets but each one is really long.",
    "Good course. Don't listen to anyone who says the math is hard. It's nothing more than taking a derivative once, and it's a minor part of the course.",
    "A good course to take if you want to see how economics relates to public policy.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material was very useful and practical. It was the most interesting Economics class that I have taken (for content not the profesor). It answered real life questions and policies."
