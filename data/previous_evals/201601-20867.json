    "If you are planning to be an Architecture major, these classes will be either the best or worst thing to happen to you. Only do it if you are wholly committed and know that you can: there are people who basically became AWOL toward the end of the semester. Being in studio has without a doubt been some of my best experiences at Yale. You will get to know a bunch of amazing, interesting and really caring people (though it can be a little awkward breaking in at first) who will come to be your closest friends and the only people who truly understand the strange, at times meaningless, yet powerful architectural journey you are on. Some of my favourite Yale memories have been the sunrises from the roof of Rudolph, the all-nighters when you are tired beyond comprehension, and the newfound ability to nap anywhere: on floors, tables of seminar rooms, hard couches. 249 will teach you a lot about architecture. You will learn how to model, how to think about architecture in a totally different way. Ariane is amazing, as are the TAs, and I cannot begin to thank them enough for how much they have helped us the past semester. It will often be confusing, you will question your sanity, your ideas will be shot down; but you will also pick yourself back up, brush off the criticism and push through because there are amazing people alongside you who are there with you for the entire ride. Quick tips for survival: - Meet the TAs and email Ariane outside of desk crits. Start over the weekend, and you will be at a much better place. - Artist & Craftsman's Supply is much much cheaper than Hull's - In general, your models should not look like your house (they want interpretive) - DO NOT pull an allnighter for week 2. sketch models are BS, the best ones are the desperate 10 minute ones you come up with. - experiment with materials!! - if you press play on the laser cutter rather than on the monitor of the computer, you don't get charged for an extra cut.",
    "This course will make you bleed and take your youth. Honestly. But I can't imagine a better preparation to architecture studio! PLexiglass. Wood. You'll learn to adore them. An you'll spend over $500 unles the system fixes itself. But this class will ACTUALLY teach you how to analyze buildings. How to understand post-humanism. It balances the traditional way we understand architecture with break-through schools of thought. It will prepare you for Junior Studio. An bring you closer to your fellow architecture majors. Ariane is the most amazing, smart, funny, no-nonsense professor ever. She actually tries to help your project be amazing and develop your interests and true potential. Honestly this is an amazing class, we love you, Ariane!",
    "I think the course depends a lot on who the professor is. This year, we had a very passionate professor, who spent a lot of time with us. It taught us a lot of skills and it is fun building models. However, it does take a lot of time, and it also is stressful, especially because we did not know what the goal of the course was. If you are taking this course, talk with your TFs very often. They will help you tremendously, and also in the end, they are the ones closest to you both physically and mentally.",
    "I would only recommend this class to people interested in the major. I would let them know beforehand that this is a very expensive class that essentially requires you to buy praise (and presumably grades, but those aren't out yet). The most successful students spent hundreds of dollars on each model (often past $200 on one model). I never had that kind of money, so I was very limited in what I was able to try, how large my models could be, and what materials I could use. Also, doing repeated iterations was a luxury I could not afford. So, I would certainly recommend this class to anyone with a lot of money and an interest in learning how to craft models, but I would actively discourage people without the money to pursue the class and the program. To put it quite clearly, this is a class where people with more money will do better. This may be inevitable, but nevertheless, this factor is so integral to the experience and stress of the course that it takes my rating down from excellent to good.",
    "Whether or not you're planning on being an architecture major, and you've decided to take this class, be prepared for a lot of work. That being said, this has been one of the most wonderful classes I have ever taken. Ariane is an amazing professor, and she cares so much about you learning and doing well. She understands what it's like to be a student and how time consuming this class can be. Don't be afraid to ask questions - ask the upperclassmen, your professor, your TFs, grad students in the woodshop or elevator. Anyone you talk to will be willing to help you and make it the best course possible. Everything you learn is super interesting and even if it feels like the semester is starting out slow with massing models, tectonic models, etc., once you get to environment models, it's like a whole new world has opened up. The course starts out amazing, and it only gets better. Though you may hear some horror stories about architecture and especially about these first two course you take as a sophomore, they are honestly so worth it. The people you meet in studio may become the best friends you have - trust me, no one else will understand you swearing up and down about how expensive Hull's is (btw can we get some stipend for this major???), why you were awake for 50 straight hours, or anything else. These are the people who will randomly at 5 in the morning who wants to go on an adventure, a road trip, or even on a walk to gheav. And if you're on the fence about this - do it for the rooftop access that has a beautiful view of chapel street and Harkness",
    "If you want to do the architecture major, you're going to take this, it's that simple. You probably also know what's in store for you. And if you're not, you should take it anyway! Seriously, there were a few non-majors in 154 this year, which was kind of an awful class, but it was all potential majors in this class, which I just don't get, because non-majors will literally never have another chance to take a class that will get them to think about the built environment so in-depth, and teach them skills they otherwise would never learn!",
    "The Analytic Model course was beneficial in that you learned a lot about modeling methods and critical thinking towards architecture very quickly, but the work is at times so extremely stressful; a very important lesson to be learned is to not put the work above your sanity or health as it so often seems necessary to do. In saying that, the community built around you is amazingly helpful. The professor, TFs and other students in the major will be the best and at times only support system around you. I would recommend the course with an emphasis on the determination and endurance needed for this course, but while also stressing the incredible relationships built and lessons learned by the end of this course.",
    "Sleepless nights. Infinite work. An architectural idea is never done. I can't tell the difference anymore: whether I don't want to stop working on a model OR I can't stop working on a model. Especially because this class meets the day after Drawing Architecture (PLEASE CHANGE THIS; it is unhealthy for students!!!!!!!!) it can feel grueling and impossible to finish the work. That being said, you will become incredibly invested in the class and in the peers that are experiencing the same battle as you. Architecture is the worst thing for your health and well-being, but I think you just might love it.",
    "An amazing course, but you have to be VERY committed to the program, because the amount of work is absurd.",
    "A prerequisite for the major, this is not a class anyone takes unless they have to. It is incredibly time consuming, but if you're planning on majoring this is something you accept. You will quickly learn how to analyze and build pretty decent stuff.",
    "SO MUCH WORK. But Ariane is incredible, Tim and Shay and David are SO AWESOME and it really was a great semester in all. You get super close with your classmates (for better or for worse) and you'll make some fun models. It's very intense at the beginning and very intense throughout but overall a great class.",
    "Do not, I repeat, do not take this course if you are not trying to major. It's not a course, it's a lifestyle change a lifestyle of no sleep and no weekends. If that doesn't seem possible, I get it, but trust me, it is. Also, no one tells you this, but you will go broke. Like, broke. Which I think is pretty messed up and honestly prohibitive for some students, but there you go.",
    "A blast. Sophisticated & stimulating arts and crafts. Cool buildings, immersive analysis. What's not to love?"
