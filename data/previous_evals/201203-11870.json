    "I would highly recommend the class! The discussion is very interesting, Prof. Drixler always comes prepared to teach!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this seminar. Drixler is an exceptional professor, and he runs a great seminar. There is a lot of reading, but the quality of the selections is consistently high. He also does a good job of dividing the writing assignments up through the semester so that you don't just have one huge paper at the end.",
    "Yes for sure. Take it if you want to learn about Tokugawa Japan, or if you just want a great history course.",
    "Yes, definitely. It is a wonderful class on a subject that not many people know much about."
