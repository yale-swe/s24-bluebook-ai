    "STAY AWAY. This class is utterly incomprehensible. I mean, I'm a math major, USAMO qualifier, decent score on the Putnam, all that, and I had no clue what was going on mathematically; goodness knows how the econ majors felt. Professor Horner aimed the class WAY too high, and when we'd ask him to slow down, he'd explain something really, really basic...and then go back to writing imprecise abstractions that I'm sure make sense to theoretical game theorists but might as well be hieroglyphics to Yale undergraduates. And there's no textbook, so we had no other means of learning this stuff. (\"Playing for Real\" by Binmore will explain the material conceptually, which is helpful in the beginning, but is useless for understanding the proofs.) Problem sets were a joke - the math majors would write mathematical nonsense, the econ majors would write economic nonsense, and the people who knew how to use Google would copy verbatim from published papers and claim it to be there own work. Midterm and final were pretty easy, though, and it sounds like there's a generous curve...but, still, an extremely frustrating waste of time. If you want to learn game theory, take Polack's class (or the polysci game theory class) instead.",
    "It's material you should know, but also be aware of what you're getting into with Johannes Horner. The topic selection and material isn't bad by any means, but Horner has an ungodly love of ugly algebra which made around half of the problem sets absolutely brutal to write up.",
    "Game Theory is a really interesting class. The material is great, Prof. Horner is a great lecturer, and the problem sets really make you think. Luckily, the exams are a lot easier than the homeworks, and grading is very fair. I would absolutely recommend the class, especially to someone who is interested in it mostly from the math perspective.",
    "Almost as useless as General Equilibrium Theory. Almost...",
    "It was pretty much just a math class. Lectures are very precise and clear, but the teacher can be a bit unhelpful\/snarky at times. Problem sets are a whole bunch of ugly calculations but are conceptually not that deep, so you spend a lot of time fiddling with more algebra than you'll ever see outside of a physics\/engineering sort of class. Overall, I say decent, at times mathematically rather beautiful, but not that amazing of a class.",
    "It's a tough course, but it's fantastic if you like game theory\/math\/serious critical thinking.",
    "If you want to be an Econ\/Math badly enough you will have to go through indignities such as this. Unfortunately in a class like this lecture has to be ruined because there are a lot of pricks that may not let the professor get in a word edgewise. Try to find a good study group fast (half the class constituted one this term).",
    "Simply awful. One of my three least favorite classes at Yale. 159 teaches the same material but is six time easier and four million times more enjoyable.",
    "Game Theory is a wonderful topic, and it is fantastic to have it treated in a rigorous fashion. This class is certainly not for the faint of heart, and if you can't do long algebraic simplifications that involve calculus, you might be in trouble. Plus, Johannes has a tendency to expect quite a bit more of his students then is reasonable, so expect some very late nights if you want to finish all the problem sets. Even if you do devote the time, there will be many problems that you simply cannot answer.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have a lot of time to put into the class!",
    "Very frustrating problem sets. But overall an interesting class. Professor Horner is great.",
    "This is definitely interesting if you have a strong math background with some proof based experience. If you don't, don't take this course. If you do, you will get a lot more out of this course than Ben Polak's course. Some of the problems on the problem sets are simply unreasonable but the TF should recognize this and grade the problem sets accordingly. The tests are significantly easier than the problem sets and are reasonable. The lecture notes posted online are a huge help.",
    "incredibly difficult class that is overly technical. takes a subject that should be very interesting and makes it very boring. horner is a good teacher but the content is awful. take only if you have to",
    "Funny and personable professor; difficult course material.",
    "Econ 351 is a difficult course but one in which you will learn a lot of useful information. It is mathematically fairly rigorous but Professor Horner does a great job explaining difficult concepts and the lecture notes were particularly helpful.",
    "Only take this if you are looking for a very mathematical approach to the material. There are almost no examples. Do not expect a good intuitive understanding of the material. Problem sets are pretty hard.",
    "The class is really good in that it teaches you to think critically. The problem sets are ridiculously difficult, so you just need to survive those. Most people find the midterm and final to be not as difficult. I do recommend the course, but make sure to have a strong foundation in math before you take the class.",
    "This class is not simply a more mathematical version of the other Game Theory. The problem sets are near impossible, but the tests are quite reasonable. You must be willing to spend at least 10 hours a week, probably more, trying to do these problem sets. But if you are not a very mathematical person, there will be questions that you will just simply not be able to get, and have to hope that your mathematically inclined friends have gotten.",
    "This is really great class, but watch out \u0096 the level of mathematical rigor required isn\u0092t for lit majors. Also, problem sets are very time consuming and lengthy, but thankfully, the tests are significantly easier.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone in Econs and Math major, or those who have interest in game theory and somewhat strong background in math.",
    "I took the class for fun bcs I wanted to learn what Steve Nash got his Noble Prize for. Interesting stuff, lots of interesting applied math. However, homework takes a while so be ready for that. Lecture notes by Professor are very good and clear. Overall, good class if you like applied math.",
    "I liked the class. The work is kind of weird - the problem sets are usually hard but graded leniently, lectures are mainly proofs (which are often very interesting), and the exams are supposed to be more like drill problems. It's fun because you can apply the concepts from the class to your life and annoy all your friends.",
    "If you are a math student because you like beautiful math, just a warning for you: the math in this course is not very beautiful. The concepts are poorly defined, and the most challenging problems on the homework tend to be full of tedious algebra.",
    "A really great course on game theory, with an excellent professor. I now feel I have a solid foundation in game theory. Strengths of the course are certainly the teaching of Professor Horner and his lecture notes. Take this course if you want to have a rigorous introduction in the field, but it will be a hard class.",
    "Mathematical Game Theory was a very stressful course. The problem sets were VERY hard to do, and I felt that they didn't aid in understanding the material as much as they frustrated me. The final exam was very difficult, and the later part of the course was very hard to follow. I would not recommend this course.",
    "not easyif you are good at math, you can try",
    "If you want a solid background in game theory, take this course. if you just want to take game theory because it is interesting, this may not be the course for you.",
    "Very tough.",
    "This class is the hardest class I've taken, but it was worth it."
