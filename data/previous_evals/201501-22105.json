   "comments": [
    "Yes for the love of God take this course. Moira is the best, most involved professor you will ever take a class with and the syllabus contains films you will NEVER see otherwise (films that were made in clandestinity and many that were never officially released). This class is BADASS",
    "Be prepared to bring presence to class. Participate. Make something urgent. You will receive more than a letter grade.",
    "YES, take it. Amazing films, amazing histories. I think someone said this in a previous evaluation, but go with your gut: shop the class on the first day, and you'll know asap whether the course is for you. Only thing is that the screenings are longer than average.",
    "The screenings can be rough to get through for a multitude of reasons. Sometimes they are very long, or they can affect you emotionally, but every single film that I saw I am so grateful that I got the chance. A lot of the movies are rare and hard to find so this class is a really great and unique experience. The discussions are what you make of it, but the films are so great and there is so much to unpack that there is rarely any trouble finding something to talk about.",
    "This is probably the best course I have taken at Yale. It's pretty much what you want a seminar to be - people who want to learn and are passionate about the subject meeting and helping each other learn. The time commitment was pretty heavy, but it honestly didn't even feel like \"class time\" because it was so enjoyable. Moira is wonderful - her head is in the right place when it comes to teaching. Furthermore, she is ridiculously knowledgeable. These films have been collected painstakingly by Prof. Fradinger for about 10 years. They represent an incredible time when politics, history, and art were all changing together, and in this class you get to see the product. Overall, a great course on leftist politics, film, and history. If you are lucky enough to get in, and can commit 10 or so hours a week to the class, take it! You won't regret it.",
    "Absolutely take this if you have any interest in Latin American history, the left, or film. Moira is amazing.",
    "YES. This course allowed me to reconceptualize the role that art has and can play in political movements. Every week, my understanding of what films can and should do. I highly recommend the course to any student, but especially those students of Latino or Hispanic descent\/origin. It allowed to deepen my own narrative in Latin America's tumultuous history.",
    "Absolutely fantastic. If you love film, Latin America, radicalism, the Cold War, propaganda, etc. You will love this. This class literally changed my life. I will, without a doubt, pursue documentary filmmaking because of this course. I could not recommend this more. Moira is passionate and loves and knows the material. She's also a Freirian.",
    "Intense and amazing.",
    "Radical cinema is a gem. Moira is able to create and maintain such a positive learning environment where everyone speaks honestly and treats the class with care. People are here to learn, not to impress anyone. The films are amazing and I learned so much even coming in without knowing anything about politics or Latin America. It's one of the best classes I've taken here at Yale period.",
    "Highly recommend the course both for the expertise and collaborative pedagogical approach of Prof Fradinger and for the extremely engaged and diverse group of students Moira and the course material attract.",
    "The course is very unstructured, allowing for total freedom to customize the course to the individuals in it.",
    "If you want to see something different, not read theory but see it happen in film take it!"
