    "It moves fast. Keep up.I put in a solid 20 hours\/week if not more for this class between section, class, and problem sets, and still loved it. Sometimes I was frustrated and swearing, but deep down, it was always worth it. This says two things for me: First, it speaks incredibly well of Prof. Stone, and I highly recommend him if you're going to subject yourself to this class. Second, it told me I've pickedthe right major. Rock on, physics!!",
    "Professor Stone, you're so smooth...Always.",
    "you pretty much know if you're going to be taking this class. Prof stone is a good, personable lecturer who will teach you everything you need to know about classical dynamics. the psets are pretty comprehensive and long, and the lectures can be a little hard to follow, and the tests will be hard, but its nothing you wouldn't expect from an intensive physics course. I took linear algebra and differential equations before this class, and took the class simultaneously with math 250, and felt like i was mathematically very well prepared which i was grateful for. I would advise against taking the class if you haven't done linear algebra or differential equations.",
    "It's a requirement, just grin and bear it. The material is mildly interesting, but the problem sets are killer. Be prepared to spend A LOT of time on them.",
    "This is an amazing class. In terms of the actual physics, it does not cover too many topics that you have not seen before in any intro physics course, however, it is at a much deeper level. Coming into this class, I had always felt a little uncomfortable around intense math in physics. Now that is not a problem. Through this course, I have become much better at dealing with math in physics, and thus have a much better understanding of the physical principles that cover classical mechanics. Prof. Stone is an amazing teacher and really understands what is going on. Definitely go to office hours and get to know him.",
    "I recommend this class, but of course, you have to like physics. You also have to be willing to spend your weekends working on problem sets. But it's an excellent class, I assure you.",
    "Physics 410 is a very demanding course intended for intensive physics majors. You really learn classical mechanics and gain a much deeper understanding for principles that you just accepted as fact before, but you should be prepared to work hard. With that said, I thought this was a great class, although you might not love every minute of the super long problem sets, you will appreciate this class very much in the end.",
    "Only take this course if you have balls... And you want them to get broken.",
    "This was an entertainingly challenging class. Our TA Alex Cerjan was very helpful for doing the problem sets, which would otherwise take a rather long time. With his help, the time to do the psets was around 6-10 hours, depending on the pset. Professor Stone is amazing and definitely good to know and interact with. The material itself is not too challenging to get your head around, although it might be somewhat opaque the first time it's presented in lecture.",
    "This class is for physics majors who are really interested in a more in-depth look into classical mechanics. It is a great class, but the topics can be somewhat difficult to grasp at first.The psets can be an issue if you leave them to the last minute, but overall it is a great class. You pretty much know if you're going to take it, but my suggestion is to shop both this and 401 and see which you prefer.",
    "Take this course. It is hard, but it is not as hard as other students will likely make it out to be. The workload here is comparable to math 230 or 301 both in terms of difficulty and length. This is much greater than the workload for, say, physics 260. You should probably expect 8-12 hours a week to do the problem set well on your own. However, talking to classmates or the TA reduces this significantly. The midterm was manageable and the final was definitely doable as well, both with minimal studying outside doing the problem sets. Note though that the textbook is not very good, and will likely not help you understand the material. Doug Stone will though, and the problem sets are well planned to cover the concepts.",
    "If you're reading this review, it probably means that the other reviews proclaiming doom and psets that make you break down in tears haven't deterred you. Unfortunately those reviews are pretty accurate. Yet, while Phys 410 is a strong contender for the hardest class at Yale, it is undoubtedly one of the best. Professor Stone is an amazing professor who will somehow make you care about centrifugal forces and simple harmonic motion. However, he won't let little things (such as a fire in the building) stop him from teaching you about simple harmonic motion. In short, if you're wavering between 410 and 401 try 410. But don't let the first day scare you too much.A few survival tips:1. Find a study buddy early. Not only does having a study buddy make the psets take less time (in theory), it makes the class a LOT more enjoyable. Also, it gives you a shoulder to cry on during the twentieth hour you spend with Lagrangians.2. Start the psets early. You will spend at least 15 hours with each of them. Get to know them early and Tuesday night will be much less painful. Also, when you see a problem on the midterm you will remember hours 7-10 on pset 6 and all of the methods that didn't work, then you will remember the moment when the sun broke through the clouds and you found the method that did work. It is much more rewarding than just going to TA session and (kind of) understanding how to approach the problem. Although that is an option too.3. Elect social chairs early in the semester. They should arrange nerdy study breaks, movies, etc. to temporarily relieve you of your pain. Also, crying should be allowed at all of their events.4. Remember to eat, shower, brush your teeth, etc. Especially the week before the exams. Your classmates will thank you.",
    "This course was great. Difficult, but great. I wanted to encounter some hard problems in classical mechanics, and get much more comfortable with approximation techniques, lagrangians, orbits, and I did. Also, I found the instruction of chaos to be quite illuminating. It's a lot of work, but if you want to take this class, nothing I say about how hard it is will dissuade you. Good luck!",
    "This course is intense, no two ways about it. Problem sets will consume your life and the exams are murder. But, you gotta do what you gotta do! Besides, you'll make good friends and learn really cool physics. Professor Stone is top-notch and always accessible."
