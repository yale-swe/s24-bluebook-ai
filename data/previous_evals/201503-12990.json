    "I would recommend this course to another student. Private lessons are essential to continued musical growth.",
    "Musi 460 gives you a chance to work one-on-one with a professor at the School of Music. You get graded on an A-F scale (unlike in 360, where you get graded on a P\/F scale). I've had the chance to study with Elizabeth Parisot, and it's been an incredible experience. She's an amazing pianist and an even better person. It's really neat to be a part of the School of Music community - it's really one of the most exciting and prolific conservatories in the world. You're expected to put in a lot of work every week, but if you truly love music, it's definitely worth it. Prof. Parisot is intense of enough for me to make a lot of progress with each successive lesson but relaxed enough for me to explore aspects of Yale other than music. (I can't speak to the styles of other professors because I don't interact with them, but it seems as though other students have had similar experiences.) I'd highly recommend this class to everyone who gets in.",
    "Um.. I'd recommend it to those interested in pursuing classical instrumental performance at a high level."
