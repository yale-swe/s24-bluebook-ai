   "comments": [
    "Definitely good, but not really a survey course. We didn't talk about general trends in Roman politics or that much history in between the items we examined. It's good if someone wants something on inscriptions, but the broad nature of the course would likely exclude a lot of interest.",
    "I would summarize the class as the use of classics, history, and literary analysis to study documents of Roman history.I would highly recommend the course to a classics student. I would not recommend the course to history or divinity students without a strong background in Roman history, Latin, and Greek."

   "comments": [
    "As a divinity student interested in the Greco-Roman world, it definitely helped broaden my understanding of Roman history. As stated above, it was perhaps too broad, but coming from another field it gave me some points of interest I would have been ignorant of otherwise.",
    "Mainly this course helped me to see how the close study of individual documents can contribute greatly to the overall examination of an era. I learned how to approach a document from different perspectives and with different skills. Such an understanding is vital to becoming an Ancient Historian."
