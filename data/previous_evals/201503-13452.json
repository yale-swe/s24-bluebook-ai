    "Simon knows a lot but is not good at explaining things.",
    "I think the class would have benefited from more problem sets and weekly assignments. It was difficult to pay attention a lot of the time in class because the professor was hard to hear and hard to follow. That said, Simon was very receptive to feedback and very responsive when asked questions over email, or in person. He was very available but it was difficult to self-motivate to keep up with the course work without weekly assignments.",
    "(Q2) Out of work class was never graded (except for exams and projects) and didn't feel very helpful for a range of analyses. Examples were very specific for one thing but weren't always readily translated for other uses. I would have liked more emphasis on understanding the information throughout instead of relying on a few conglomerated assessments at the end.",
    "Simon was a good professor - he seems a little uncomfortable at times. He was good one on one.",
    "Prof. Queenborough is clearly knows the topic well, but the lecture essentially consisted of him running through problems on the project screen in front of the class. There was not enough engagement with the students nor explanation of the detail of the code we were learning."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course should begin with a simple overview of coding language. I was lost in the beginning trying to distinguish functions from arguments, and types of arguments, etc. That might only take 30 mins in the first class, but it would be very valuable for people like me that had no experience with coding at all.",
    "Instructor needs to explain things better.",
    "- Classroom was too big and not suited for teaching a course like R statistical programs. A more closer room would be preferable.",
    "Since it was a lot of following along- if you messed up a part of the R code- it would be easy to fall behind in class.",
    "-The head instructor was awful, particularly: --He had frequent problems with the microphone...daily, throughout the entire semester. This wasted class time and quickly went from entertaining to irritating as the semester went on. --I used to be a teacher, I know it's a challenge. However, he did not rise to this challenge. He was really unable at making the content accessible to students. It is programming, but it needn't be taught in such a dry manner. Truly mind-numbing and did not demonstrate creative effort. Programming can be really interesting --I recommend finding an instructor who demonstrates more outward excitement about R \/ programming. I would never take this class again, nor would I recommend it to other students; not because of the content, but because of the instructor.",
    "Needs a drastic improvement in organization. Programming takes time and practice and when the instructor is only looking at your code personally a few times and mostly at the end of the semester, it isn't a very helpful way to go about learning if you are doing it right, making mistakes, or how you could be doing better. I would like less lecture (it's completely ineffective for something like this) and more guided work. For example, I would like things to be broken down by week. Go over 1-2 new things per week, each building on something from previous weeks. Homework assignments and in-class work (NOT in-class lecture covering a problem all together, it doesn't help to just copy and paste code, you don't learn how to do it on your own) that can be reviewed by instructors\/TAs for comprehension. I'm fine withe exams and projects, but I feel like there should be more individual assessment prior to those. Overall it was a confusing course that wasn't easy to follow.",
    "In lecture, it would be great if Simon could speak more loudly and clearly. Also - I would recommend having short required exercises for students to do. Maybe even just they get credit for trying. That might help faciliated interactivness and questions.",
    "Professor Queenborough's teaching style. There was little incentive to work on exercises outside of class, as we would just be discussing them in future classes. In addition, often the Prof. would walk us through problems without explaining the lines of code he was using in sufficient detail. It would be nice to know what each piece of code represented, what it could be substituted with, what kinds of object can be used for different functions, etc."
