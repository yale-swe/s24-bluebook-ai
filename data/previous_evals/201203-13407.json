    "I would definitely recommend this class. Gibbons was really helpful, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to, plus it was a really relevant and interesting topic. You do a lot of revision and he provides specific ways to make your paper better for each one. I came out a lot more confident about my writing than I did when I came in.",
    "This class was a great learning experience and eye opener to the power sports actually have in American society. I would recommend this writing seminar to future students because it was a really interesting topic to study and it also was a subject that we could see and apply in our daily lives.",
    "Probably one of the more difficult writing seminars. However it is a really fun class and the articles we read are interesting and thought provoking. Gibbons is really willing to work with you and your schedule, but he is a tough grader on the papers. Tough but fair. I would recommend it because I feel like I learned how to be a better writer, and I made lifelong friends in that class.",
    "If you are uncomfortable with your writing skills or want to improve, I definitely suggest this class. Not only did my writing improve, I now think about Sports and American Culture with a more analytical perspective. This class will make you think about how writers are writing about different athletes and how Sportscenter represents different sports and people.",
    "Great writing course. you will become a better writer and the subject matter is very interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this class especially if Professor Gibbons teaches it.",
    "I would summarize the class as a sports writing class where you get to write about the things occuring in the sporting world. I would recommend it to another student because it is very fun.",
    "A great class if you want to improve your writing skills. The subject matter is very interesting and the papers are broad enough to allow you talk about almost any sporting interest.",
    "This is a great class. I would HIGHLY recommend it. The material is very interesting and Professor Gibbons is the best. YOu really learn how to improve your writing.He is always open to help you with your writing and sends feedback regularly. The work becomes very managable because the class and work is so engaging. Class discussion makes the class tight-knit and enjoyable. I always looked forward to coming to class.",
    "three 5 page papers, one 10 page. very manageable yet interesting.",
    "This is a great class for someone who is interested in popular sports issues in American culture and is looking to improve their writing skills."
