    "A lot of important research writing skills and time management (!!) when writing papers. It is the only class that has successfully taught me how to write a paper slowly (over the course of a week or two) and pleasantly, rather than in a very horrible and stressful four hour mess. This has been my least stressful finals period ever because a) i wrote the final for this class weeks ago and b) i wrote all my finals over the course of a few days\/weeks. Also I started to get ideas for what I wanted to write my senior thesis about. And practice with SPSS.",
    "How to critically evaluate psych research and design and execute a study.",
    "I learned every step in coming up with, executing, and writing a paper about an experimental psychology study.",
    "I learned so much about how to conduct research and the level of quality is necessary for research write-ups.",
    "I learned about how best to conduct psychological experiments and important mishaps to be aware of when running a test.",
    "I learned a lot about how to conduct a research project and all that goes into it. I have also learned how to critique research. ( how to review\/ understand good research vs. improper research)",
    "In this course, I learned how to conceive of, design, execute, and write up a psychological experiment, from start to finish. I learned how to conduct ethical and scientifically sound research. Additionally, this course really helped me to improve my ability to read and comprehend psychology articles and papers.",
    "I learned what goes into conducting psychological research, how to decide on a research question, how to design and carry out a psychological study, how to connect my research with previous literature, and how to better write a psychology paper."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Hirsch being so great!!, Structure of course (two papers, exam, and quizzes, rough drafts, etc.), size of class (group work went really well), set students up for success Weakness: textbook seemed out of date and had some questionable jokes",
    "The course is really organized and has a lot of deadlines to keep you on track, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on the person. It could be improved by changing the outdated textbook, but Prof. Hirsch is planning to do that next semester already.",
    "I think this class was really straightforward and great as a requirement for psychology majors.",
    "I found the textbook to be pretty out of date.",
    "I think this class could do a better job of expanding beyond two case studies of experiments.",
    "The book was not ideal some of the info was out dated. It is a very fast paced course but manageable more or less.",
    "This course was extremely well organised. The way the course was laid out and formatted made it very easy to keep up with the material and work. The material was well taught, which made it easy to understand. The daily quiz format helped to cement my understanding of the information covered, and made a great study tool for the midterm. Although the workload of this course is somewhat high, dividing each of the papers up into their component pieces was incredibly helpful for keeping the workload manageable, as were all of the smaller assignments that helped to prepare us to write each section of the paper. All in all, I never felt like any of the assignments were \"busywork\": I really felt like I got something out of every bit of work I did for this course. The cherry on the top of this course was the feedback. While the course was fantastic in and of itself, what really made this particular class stand out to me was how detailed and comprehensive the feedback we received on each of our assignments was. It was so incredibly helpful, especially as this is a course where you are learning an entirely new skillset, not just working on improving at something you already know how to do.",
    "This is an incredibly well taught course that breaks up what seems like a daunting amount of work into more easily manageable components that help you retain the information you are learning better in the long run. The group project we executed in the first half of the semester was an excellent introduction to psychological research, and turning in the four components of the paper in four chunks made the process much less stressful. Also, simulating lab meetings during class time while discussing our own projects was one of the most useful ways of getting feedback. The professor and TA were fantastic and made themselves very available to students in case we needed help."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you aren't a psychology major it would be kinda random to take it but still probably enjoyable and good for your writing skills. It taught me time management. And I had fun designing my own experiment. Professor Hirsch is awesome but I'm sure the other Profs are cool too.",
    "Yes, if you need to take research methods-- I think Prof. Hirsch's class is one of the best options. I was dreading having to take research methods but actually liked it.",
    "I would recommend this for any students that want to conduct research at or beyond Yale.",
    "If you're going into a psychology field, this class is imperative. While, yes, it is a requirement, it also is really helpful because it teaches you to appreciate and understand the research process.",
    "I think that it is a good class for people who plan on doing psychological research.",
    "If they had to take it I guess so. But probably not in the morning if it can be avoided. That class at 9am on Monday was difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Although it does have a heavy workload, the course is organised in such a way that it keeps the workload manageable. You will definitely get a lot out of this class.",
    "If you are a psych major, absolutely (aside from the fact that it is a required course). This class is a lot of work but is well taught and super rewarding."
