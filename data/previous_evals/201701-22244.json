    "I learned a good deal about basic physiology of various systems in the human body. However, there was little crossover between systems, which makes the knowledge less useful.",

    "A systematic and integrated approach to human body systems. Ability to understand an histology slide.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are that many of the faculty are experts in their field and provide good lectures on their topic. The weaknesses of this course lie in the false advertisement of this course as being \"histology\" focused. This was the only reason I took this course, and I learned almost zero histology. It was only ever included as an afterthought, never the focus of any homework assignments, and generally treated as an unimportant part of the course. This would be the thing I would change most about this course to improve it, actually making it a histology course. The course in its current form is more like a broad overview of physiology and generally a waste of time. This course should have general physiology as a prerequisite so the background information can be assumed to be known, then the lectures can focus principally on histology so graduate students can learn this critical clinical skill.",
    "Strengths: presented another aspect of physiological processes we had learned in another class; the type of homework for evaluation of the course is appropriate for this course Weaknesses: slow return of homeworks and the initial description of how a homework should be done was not accurate; the grading sometimes felt very arbitrary and I would have liked some feedback",
    "The course was incredibly spread out and thin. The homework never provided useful feedback. The TA was snippy with us any time we asked about getting feedback. The lectures were all over the place and so was the grading. Highly inconsistent course that offered little to no insights.",
    "I expected this course to provide more detailed molecular, mechanistic insight into anatomy\/physiology and cell biology of the systems discussed, as well as some of the diseases that were mentioned. The course lecturers varied widely in terms of quality and ability to engage the student audience.",
    "Very well thought by leading professors in their field",
    "The weakness of this course was the homework system. The expectations were widely different among the different professors who assigned and graded the homework, and were not communicated to the students. Additionally, we did not receive feedback on any of the homework assignments until late in the semester, when we had already turned in many assignments."

   "comments": [
    "No. This course is not useful in its present form. It is listed as a histology course, but in actuality teaches you essentially no histology and presents a broad overview of systems biology as independent entities rather than pieces of a whole.",
    "Yes. I learned new material that may be useful in the future.",
    "No, there was no point in taking the course. By the end of the semester less than 5 students were regularly showing up.",
    "I'd recommend this course to every biology student who would like a glimpse to system biology",
    "yes-- get to learn about ongoing research not only the biology behind it.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to students who focus on biochemistry. The class is good at giving you a broader view as to how the various components of the body work together. This is something you can miss out on in a class more focused on biochemistry."
