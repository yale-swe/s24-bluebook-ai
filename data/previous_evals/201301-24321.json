    "G&G 701 is a course about the science of global warming. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in global warming and climate change, especially for non-scientists and potential policymakers who want to understand what they are advocating for and why.",
    "Recommend. The course is a great way to expand the knowledge.",
    "If you are interested in a multi discipline study of global warming, take this course.",
    "Yeah. It will be very helpful.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course, because we could broaden our knowledge on global warming.",
    "Yes, excllent way to learn historical progression of climate change science.",
    "Yes, to get a broader understanding of the development of the science behind climate change.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. One can get a nice overview of the most important studies in the area of climate change from Fourier (early 19th century) to the present day.",
    "Yes, definitely! I learned a lot and it was fantastic to have an opportunity to have directed readings about the science of climate change.",
    "Great class if you want a history of science papers written on global warming. You read 2-5 papers per week. Each student presents a paper before class. You must attend 3-5 lectures outside of class on climate. Finally, you write a 10 page paper at the end of the term. Great readings and great discussion. Take it!",
    "this is an overview of some major scientific papers and studies that construct the lineage of thinking about climate change. it focuses on the technical, however discussion is free to move toward culture, values, and politics, should you bring it there. if you want to grasp the science but don't need to do the science, take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course."

    "I understand climate change science much more deeply than I did before, although it is not particularly germane to my own research.",
    "I broadened my understanding of the evolution of the climate model.",

    "yes this course is linked to my senior thesis research project",
    "Gave me a better background for the development of climate change science and understanding, which is what I plan to build a career on.",
    "it gives me more authority to bring the lineage of the science and many technicalities into my communicating and thinking about climate change. i'm very grateful for that.",
