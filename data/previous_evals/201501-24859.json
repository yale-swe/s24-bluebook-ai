    "If you have an interest in Chaucer, then I would recommend taking this class to explore a more in-depth discussion of a wider variety of Chaucer's works.",
    "This was a fantastic course! ENGL 434 essentially gives you the opportunity to look at Chaucer's work from different angles, making it a great forum in which to practice medieval criticism. The course gives you some opportunities to engage with source texts, but it is primarily a study of Chaucer's work, with approximately half of the semester dedicated to The Canterbury Tales. I actually found the first half of the class, which looked at other, lesser known works, to be even more exciting, but I truly loved this class the entire semester. Professor Minnis is great to work with, and the other students were kind and thoughtful--very much a self-selecting group! Overall, I would definitely recommend this course' it is a great way to round out your experience in the English department."
