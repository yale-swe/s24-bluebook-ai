   "comments": [
    "Its a relatively straight forward course and at times was quite interesting, at other times it was repetitive and monotonous",
    "Summary: The first part is 5 modules of topics pertinent to chemical biology -- each is 2 lectures and then class discussion of articles. The second part is student presentations of similar topics in the field.I would recommend the class for students looking to broaden their knowledge and exposure to fields of chemical biology, but no necessarily to students very concerned with grades or the exact material they are going to learn -- since the field is changing so rapidly, the course content changes from year to year.",
    "I'd recommend it. It is one of those classes that is more seminar like, so to me is always more engaging. It's fun to learn about research at the edge and what may be around the corner.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It gives a great overview of chemical biology. While it is impossible to touch on every aspect of chemical biology.",
    "I think the setup of the class made it fairly easy, and there was a good deal of chemistry and biology in it. I would reccommend this class because it is one of the better classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. It is an interesting class that covers the intersection of chemistry and biology.",
    "It's ok. The course tries to walk a fine line between Chemistry and Biology. It doesn't always achieve balance, but it's good for people who want a glimpse of the other field.",
    "I would not recommend this class."

   "comments": [
    "This class was very helpful for me because a vast majority of the material was new for me, and I'm at the point in my education that as much exposure as possible to ideas and research related to my field is important and a necessity! It directly impacted my dissertation research, as I am now better able to understand the biological implications of my research.",
    "This class exposed me to numerous techniques and ideas, whose value cannot be truly quantitated. Without a doubt, the knowledge and outside-the-box thinking will be a benefit to my future. I am glad I took this class.",
    "The material covered helped my understanding of the field of chemical biology, which I prior thought was synonomous with biochemistry. Since chemistry and biology overlap in many ways, becoming familiar with this field is extremely beneficial because you can draw many parallels.",
    "This class will help me with my dissertation. But other classes would have been more useful, and if I could choose again I would take another class."
