I think the students were dedicated to providing engaging and informative presentations, which was wonderful; however, the frequency of these class presentations could have been announced at the beginning of the course.",
    "I found the thematic arrangement of the course very engaging. I also really enjoyed the field trips. I think they have been very helpful in understanding the different issues and approaches on a practical level. My main suggestion would be to perhaps consider spreading the presentations more (maybe alternate the weeks\/people), so the students have more time to prepare for them and there is more room for discussion. It also would have been helpful to have a plan for these in advance."
