    "Yes, definitely do an independent study essay. Much more rewarding than writing an essay in a course, and allows you to develop a real relationship with your advisor and really learn the subject material you're writing about.",
    "It's your senior essay. You kind of have to do it to graduate, right?",
    "Writing the senior essay as an independent research project allows you to reserve more time to do research and to write. I enthusiastically recommend it.",
    "This is an excellent way to write a senior essay. The workshops facilitate the process, and it is great to see what types of topics peers are pursuing.",
    "Take care to make something meaningful out of your senior paper, but limit your ambitions. A true senior thesis can't be written during a semester (or year) in which it competes with an excessive amount of other academic work and senior activities. The senior essay is closer to a lengthy assignment than a true thesis. It should be recognized and treated as such.",
    "Make sure you have a good working relationship with your advisor\/grader! I wish I'd chosen a professor I studied under before, instead of going with somebody who's an expert on my particular topic. The draft workshops were very helpful in terms of getting you to come up with something and leave yourself time to make edits. But the peer feedback, for me at least, was not as helpful in itself. I would recommend doing your senior essay through a seminar, unless (like me) you have a very specific idea of what you'd like to write about.",
    "An excellent way to tackle your senior thesis, especially yearlong."
