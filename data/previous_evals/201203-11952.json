   "comments": [
    "GMAN 150 is a great introduction to German literature. It is great to come across a wide array of authors who each develop their own style. Using the grammatical and analytical tools that we developed, we could dig deeper and deeper in the texts as the class proceeded. Overall a great course for anyone with an interest in German literature.",
    "L5 German is much heavier on literary analysis than it is on the vocabulary\/grammar-oriented lessons of L1-L4. It's basically a literature class in another language; don't expect too much formal instruction on the language itself. German literature being German literature, prepare to be confused about 80% of the time. To be honest, it's not the most practical class to take if you want to improve your German, unless you're going to be attending many dinner parties with German literature scholars in the future, but it's a great introduction to some really fascinating texts. You should really make sure that you have a good grasp of grammatical rules before you take it, though, because you need it to understand the formal experimentation of many of the texts.",
    "You will read a number of works of German literature for craft, and write essays and reading responses on them. In this way, the class is similar to an English lit class, but of course your grammar and mechanics in German will be improved as well. If you place into L5, I would highly recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend GMAN 150 to a fellow student, it's a great introduction to advanced German literature!"
