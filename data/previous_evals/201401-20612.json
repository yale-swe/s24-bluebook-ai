    "Translations and literature from Latin for beginners.",
    "Although the material is challenging, I would recommend this course to students. The workload at times is arduous, but definitely bearable. Also, I though that having Chris as a teacher made the class all the more great.",
    "Latin 120 is a continuation from where you left off in Latin 110. I would definitely recommend it, because everything you learnt in first semester latin is put to use with actual Latin texts. You also learn the finer points of Latin in this course.",
    "Latin can be a difficult language to learn, but this course made it easy and fun. As long as you put in the effort, you will get something out of it. I absolutely would recommend it to a fellow student."
