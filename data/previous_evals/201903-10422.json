    "How to take photographs, more about the history of photography",
    "I learned specifics on how to take photos.",
    "I learned how to use a DSLR, edit in Photoshop, and print photos! This class changed the way I think about and produce photos, even on my iPhone.",
    "The basics of making pictures in camera RAW, photoshop and printing photos. The class also introduces you to the work of some well known photographers and allows you to hone your perspective.",
    "Technical skills of taking and editing raw digital photographs using bridge and photoshop. Also, some of the theoretical and historic background to the medium.",
    "This is a fun class to learn the basics of photography and image processing. Attention was given to how to use a camera, how to take phots that can be sufficiently digitally manipulated, and make images that say something to its audience. We spent a good amount of time looking at famous or canonical photographers for inspiration and context, and had interesting conversations about the context and content of the photographers and their work.",
    "Valuable knowledge of the history of the digital photograph, as well as seminal photographers and photographic moment."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: flexibility, fun, knowledgeable professor Weaknesses: not enough direction",
    "its chiil. its nice",
    "Strengths: Classmates, Ted, and TAs were super nice, definitely felt like a safe space to explore and be creative, even if you're not super experienced with photography\/art in general. Weaknesses: requires an expensive camera, expensive paper, lab fee, etc. Was worth it for me, but can see how it's limiting for other students who may be interested.",
    "The course could be improved if there were more opportunities to receive feedback. This semester, we had just one critique before our final portfolio critique.",
    "The course really forces you into many photographs, and in the end you come out of it with a body of work you will be proud of. I wish we spent more time at the beginning of the semester looking at photographs and talking about them.",
    "I wish there was a little more structure to the curriculum, or rather more opportunities for critique so there was more of a fire under me to be making photos, but the chill pace of the class worked well with the casual classroom environment and how much fun the editing and printing process ended up being.",
    "Course could use a little more homework! As weird as that is to say, I would have liked any opportunity to learn a bit more about any aspect of digital photography\/photographers. However, a strength was definitely the focus on both looking at and making as many photographs as possible!!"

    "yee if u wanna learn to take photos. Ted is hella chill and a good teacher.",
    "Absolutely! If you have\/can afford\/can borrow a camera, go for it. It was super fun to have a creative outlet for a semester.",
    "Yes! If you are looking for a refreshing class that allows you to dive into photography and hone your voice in this art form. You have to be willing to put in the work for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you are interested in taking good photos!",
    "YES! Ted is an absolute gem, a passionate photographer and a fun presence. He really made me fall in love with the medium more than I thought I would, and gave us creative freedom to think and photograph critically and engage with each other's work in meaningful ways. I learned so much about my camera, and so much about myself and really enjoyed the process of producing tangible work that I was proud of.",
    "Yes!!!!"
