   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Math 222 as an easy way of learning applications of Linear Algebra. There is essentially no need to learn proofs (although you are shown them in class), and the tests are all fairly straightfoward. The subject is interesting (if you like math) and the workload is light.",
    "Fun stuff.",
    "This class is not difficult, but only take it if you are going into applied math. If you are not interested in applied math, I would recommend a different course. That said, the course is very easy and the professor is very good! We had problem sets assigned each class which was actually very helpful. It meant doing more psets, but with only 3-4 questions on each one. Also, the exams were not difficult at all if you studied.",
    "yes, important stuff to know",
    "It was an interesting class. If you enjoy math and can understand from lectures or the textbook, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "MATH 222 is Linear Algebra with applications. If you are going to take it, I'd recommend taking it with Schultheiss and going to class every time because it will pay off. Keeping up with the materials makes studying for the midterms and final a breeze. If you have no reason to learn linear algebra, you might not find the course that interesting, but for Math\/Science nerds, definitely.",
    "Math 222 is exactly what it\u0092s described as in the Yale College Programs of Study. It covers all of the topics and applications listed, nothing more and nothing less. At first the class focuses on theory to form the framework for linear algebra. Then the class gradually progresses toward application after you develop the skills needed to analyze linear systems. For people thoroughly interested in the theory, I would recommend Math 225 over this, but for people interested in application, applied math, or economics, for example, this class provides you with the tools needed to analyze the many important mathematical aspects you deal with in these fields. Professor Schultheiss is really enthusiastic about teaching this class and his ability to lecture with clarity and depth (without notes) is truly remarkable. Exams (two midterms and the final exam) are very fair and problem sets (3 per week) take about an hour to an hour and a half each (supposing that one does the required reading with it like one is supposed to). Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to another student interested in the theory and application of advanced math topics and for students looking to go into fields which require quantitative skills. Also, this class is definitely an extremely accessible Quantitative Reasoning credit for a student who is not a major in a quantitative field but has been exposed to differential and integral calculus.",
    "Better than the proof based class, from what I heard.",
    "This math is like puzzle solving. It's often boring, and it was my least favorite class. You'll need to read the textbook to understand the material. I would not recommend it unless you need it for something else you want to take",
    "Peter Schultheiss is a living legend. We all assume that we will one day have to move on from Yale, but Prof. Schultheiss has been here ever since he enrolled as an undergraduate in 1941. He is a wonderful man, both incredibly friendly and approachable. He clearly cares deeply about his students and would no doubt have retired decades ago if he did not. He might not be the best lecturer (he tends to focus far too much on proofs, which are so complicated that they leave the whole class bewildered) but the homeworks (assigned every class, but you have up to a week to turn them in) are pretty straightforward and the exams even more so (he lets you bring in an entire sheet of notes, which you probably don't even need anyway). He probably spends too much time on differential equations and is also a little too complex-number-happy, so we actually don't get to cover an important part of linear algebra (positive definite matrices), but nevertheless we covered far more than the other section taught by Prof. Dymarz. This course was much more enjoyable than Math 120 on many levels: the fascinating material, the low-stress tests, and the lack of premeds. Definitely take Math 222 with Prof. Schultheiss.",
    "I would recommend MATH 222 to another student.",
    "I recommend taking Math 222, even if it's not required, as long as you have the time: you learn lots of very useful material. This is especially true if you'll be taking more math in the future because knowing efficient ways to solve systems of equations can be a lifesaver (as I found out taking ENAS 194 concurrently). If you can, take it with Schultheiss. He teaches really well,and he makes previous exams available (through the Becton library) while allowing us a sheet of notes on the exams. The workload isn't too bad: 3 problem sets a week that might take about 2 hours on average--more work than Math 120 but much less work than ENAS 194. Don't get caught off guard though, there's a few really hard psets mixed in. I suggest getting a seat close to the board because Schultheiss's handwriting is really small. Also, I recommend doing the problem sets the night after they're assigned, rather than the night before they're due, because this really helps you understand the material.",
    "Yes, it is easier than 225.",
    "Pretty good course. The subject matter was sometimes quite difficult, but the tests were always fair.",
    "I would recommmend this course only if you have to take it for your major- I would not take it for fun. The math skills you learn are really important for engineering\/science majors, but they are not thrilling to learn.",
    "Chances are, if you're in it then you have to be. Prof Schultheiss is a brilliant person but he has been teaching linear algebra so long that he goes so fast and I can't understand any of his lectures- so many people in the class literally have no idea what is going on. That said, stay on top of the work and you'll be fine.",
    "It was a decent course, kind of challenging, you learn a lot of good stuff.",
    "On one hand, the problem sets and exams aren't that bad; you can hand in problem sets up to a week after they are assigned (one assigned every class) and you can bring in a sheet of paper with notes for midterms (2 sheets for the final.) The book was hard to understand, and it was tough to sift through the information from lectures and find the truly important points. Once I understood topics and the applications, I did find the math I had learned from this course to be interesting and applicable.",
    "It's an interesting course worth considering. It's very different from calculus, but also points out the many interesting applications of higher mathematics. Some of the more abstract concepts behind it can make the course difficult to follow, but overall the math is generally well grounded by using more concrete examples.",
    "I would take it if you like math or need it for a major. I dont think its worth it just to take. There are problem sets every class, and you should stay on top of them.",
    "This class is a very basic survey of linear algebra. A lot of topics are left untouched and more topics are covered at a very basic level. For someone who is very interested in mathematics, I would recommend looking into math 225 because I feel they will learn more. That said, it is a fairly easy class and I ended up learning a lot because it was my first linear algebra course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're somewhat interested in math. There are relatively few proofs involved, mostly computational, and it's good to get experience with linear algebra that you probably wouldn't have gotten in your high school.",
    "Math 222 is a great class to learn about linear algebra. Prof. Schultheiss is a excellent; definitely try to take it with him if possible.",
    "Terrific course for anybody looking to learn linear algebra and, more importantly, its surprisingly versatile applications.",
    "i took this after ENAS 151 and walked into it thinking it would be much easier based on what i've read and heard about 222. i got pwned, this class was much harder than i thought it would be. the professor is nice but not a very good lecturer and has a german accent and writes really small\/weird (youll find out shopping period). the book is the most horrible POS i've had the disgust to try and learn math from. if anything, i taught myself half of the course through watching the MIT lectures from the professor who wrote the textbook (very expensive little book, btw). p-set due every lecture sometimes gets annoying, although i do admit it's probably less work than a weekly problem set. watch out for the final exam, he gave out last year's but ours had like 3 proofs on it which nobody probably expected at all. curve for the class is also non-existent. you're probably taking it as a requirement though, so suck it up, it's not that bad of a class in the end if you have to take it, the things you learn i can tell is going to be useful in any field of science\/engineering. one more thing, the other section covers different topics than this one (slightly). for example, fourier series and error squared (just like taylor series and lagrange error, holy crap) is covered in this section but not the other..",
    "Compared to 120, Linear is a more straightforward course. Schultheiss is a good lecturer, but can be hard to understand at times due to his slight accent and fast lecturing speed. The course basically teaches you everything you ever wanted to know about matrices. The professor puts out practice tests and lets you bring an equation sheet into the test. Averages on tests were usually pretty high, but that's not to say that the tests were all easy. Overall, easier and more straightforward than 120. Take it if you're majoring in math.",
    "If you're going to take Math 222 take it with Professor Schultheiss.",
    "Math 222 was a genuinely fun math course. It is a much needed break from calculus, and is in many ways like starting over in math and going back to grade school where it is all about remembering how to add correctly and such. There are three problem sets a week, but they are only a few questions each, so the total workload is not any greater than for a course with one longer problem set. The first midterm is easy, the second not so much. I really enjoyed having Schultheiss, so I would recommend him if possible.",
    "Basics of linear algebra. straight forward.",
    "A good course that was as advertised; it just met most of my expectations. A decent workload with the daily problem sets. Although the lectures often had theoretical and hard to understand proofs, the practice problems mostly came down to manipulating arithmetic. The course really does focus on applications and computations rather than the deeper theory behind linear algebra (so take 225 if you want that instead). Prof. Schultheiss is also really nice and accessible. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in mathematics.",
    "an excellent, math course teaching math the way it is meant to be taught. p-sets are of average difficulty with some exceeding average difficulty. The tests are extremely straight-forward and easy to study for. this class is a beautiful class that reveals a lot of imnportant math that can be readily applied to the real world. all in all, an excellent course.",
    "I would recommend Math 222 to all students that are interested and are not thinking about majoring in math. Math 225 is a better class for math majors.",
    "If you need to take linear algebra and dislike theoretical math, you should take Math 222 with Schultheiss. The course itself stays true to its roots\u0097the problem sets and tests emphasize formulas and light proofs using principles you should know, rather than deviating into theoretical bases for certain formula or complicated derivations of theorems from other theorems. The material itself is not too difficult, and Schultheiss\u0092s ensures you understand the material through his teaching ability and thrice weekly problem sets, the latter of which are manageable and force you to keep up to date on the material. Two notes of warning: his handwriting is pretty bad, and occasionally he will lecture on proofs that have absolutely no relevance to the problem sets or exams. Overall, though, the course is one of the better ones I\u0092ve taken at Yale, one that satisfied me both with what I\u0092ve learned and how fairly I was assessed in my competence.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. It's a very important and useful course, No matter you major."
