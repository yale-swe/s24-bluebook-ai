    "GLBL 390 provides an overview of emerging issues related to cyber. It weaves in policy, law, technology, war--really anything that cyber touches. Its interdisciplinary nature makes it accessible to people from varied background, whether political science or computer science.",
    "Very good course - highly relevant topics discussed every class and engaging conversations led by Prof. Wittenstein. Weekly emails with updates in the cyber field to discuss in that week's class.",
    "I would highly recommend GLBL 390 to other students, in global affairs, political science or even computer science. Very important field in the future of foreign affairs and very useful for CS majors to learn about the policy side of things.",
    "Incredible class! Wittenstein is an amazing professor and he really set up the class in such a way as to make each and every one of us want to work hard, learn the material, and demonstrate our knowledge in the briefings, group projects and final paper. I learned so much about cyber space and cyber security all thanks to this amazing class."
