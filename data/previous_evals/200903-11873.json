   "comments": [
    "Fantastic class and required for the HSHM major.",
    "If it's not required for your HSHM major, then there are a lot better history seminars out there. However, this is not a course to be dreaded, especially if Bill Summers is teaching it. Although class discussions are weak and some of the readings were difficult to understand, it's not time consuming. The term paper can also be about *anything* connected to science, medicine, and the history of that subject. It's a really nice way to start thinking about your senior paper and learning how to prepare for it with primary sources.",
    "If you don't have to take this class, DON'T TAKE IT. It was the most miserable 2 hours of my week, every week. I still have absolutely NO idea what the point was of the class.",
    "This class is a boring attempt to make HSHM students meet each other and learn how to write papers. It is terrible. I would never recommend it, but unfortunately it is required.",
    "I would recommend this course only to someone who needs it for the major. Otherwise, don't take it.",
    "It was a great introduction to the literary cannon of HSHM, which any HSHM major should be familiar with. Professor Summers' discussions really made the course intellectually fulfilling. Finally, the course paper was a stimulating introduction to rigorous research and writing in the field.",
    "This course was extremely scattered. It didn't even seem much like a history of science and medicine course at all -- it seemed more like a \"this is what Professor Summers wants to talk about today\" kind of class. The readings were uninteresting and often rather off topic (a discussion on canon? really?), except for the really long book on DNA that I didn't have time to read. Some of them were too wordy and philosophical to get through. And by the end of the course, when Professor Summers asked us to create a \"syllabus\" for a history of science class and a history of medicine class, no one could even name periods of history of science and medicine that would be important. Considering we couldn't even do a broad overview of the topic of HSHM by the end of this course, I would say that it isn't very good as a required course, unless the syllabus were made to be more structured and more descriptive of HSHM instead of just teaching us that the \"scientific revolution\" might or might not be a concept that exists.In other words, you all will only be taking this course if you have to, anyway.",
    "It's not horribly painful, but it's not that interesting either. Not too much work. You're probably only taking it because you have to, don't be afraid.",
    "Well, you probably aren't taking this class unless you are a HSHM major, and if you are a HSHM major it's required. I think it's pretty useful as a survey-type-class for HSHM, but I'd definitely recommend exploring the professors who will be teaching it each semester before you sign up."
