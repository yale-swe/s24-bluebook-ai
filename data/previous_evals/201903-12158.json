   "comments": [
    "It did a great job of teaching a very wide variety of basic German words and grammar. I feel like the course could have been conducted at a slightly slower pace so as to focus more on grammar structure.",
    "Strengths: Class is generally interesting and engaging. The final project was enjoyable and reinforced the grammar and vocabulary I learned well. Weaknesses: The homework on ConnectPlus is tedious and repetitive to an excessive degree that doesn't help learning. The Kontakte textbook in general is mediocre. Speaking tasks on tests are needlessly difficult.",
    "The course included an online discussion board which I found to be unproductive. Of all of our activities and projects, I got the least out of this. Otherwise, the course was structured well. The final video project was particularly engaging and a lot of fun.",
    "I felt that more time could have been spent on grammar and structure. The vast majority of the course was taught in German which made it especially difficult to pick up on grammar. This course taught a large bit of vocabulary, but although the non-cumulative nature of the tests made my life a little easier, I felt that I would currently have a better handle on vocabulary had the tests been cumulative.",
    "The course taught me a lot, but one weakness is that is was very limited to the content of the textbook and the teaching was focused around that. The textbook as pretty good in my opinion. I did not like how the grading of the tests was done not by the course teacher but by someone else."

    "Absolutely! The professor was fantastic and I had tons of fun while learning at the same time.",
    "Yes, a good introductory course to German. The workload is challenging but generally not excessive. If you do your work and pay attention you will see good improvement in your German skills.",
    "If you want to learn German, you've got to take GMAN110. So I guess I would recommend to those people.",
