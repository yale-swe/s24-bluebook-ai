   "comments": [
    "Backwards teaching is a phenomenal tool. I actually learned the material through perseverance and explanation which is not true for many of my courses.",
    "This course feels well \"dialed-in\" and I thought the pacing, sequence, and content of the course to be well structured.",
    "Very interesting and useful course!",
    "This was a really good course--the structure makes sense, lectures are engaging, and homework was just challenging enough. It may be improved by having some sort of excel basics session outside of class--on week 10, we spent 15 minutes of class discussing really basic excel functions that should have been learned elsewhere (summing rows, etc). That really disengaged students who have known how to use excel for many years.",
    "strength: professor is very animated weakness: you get no feedback on your homework; you cannot get an honors unless you get 100 on everything; format of the course is not conducive to all learning styles",
    "This course is the best one I have taken at YSPH. David is an amazing professor -- he is clear in what he wants, extremely responsive to student concerns, approachable, and funny. I looked forward to going to this class each week. The tests are somewhat difficult, but they are not impossible. Stick with it, and everything will turn out.",
    "The first section before the first midterm was easy. It was a cake walk compared to the future weeks. In fact I felt like we kept doing the same things over and over. And the probability review was unnecessary. The markov modeling and CEA are the meat of this course, the hardest topics and get the least amount of time. I would have preferred 3 classes MAX before the first mideterm and more time on the meat!",
    "The course was interesting and had relevant topics, however the way in which it was taught was very weak. It was essentially a do-it-yourself course and wait until class time for the instructor to go over the assignments. It could be improved if the instructor introduced students to new topics in class and then had them do the HW assignment on it after - students would get much more out of that model.",
    "This course is extremely difficult and is predominantly self-study. If you understand the course material, however, it will be a great asset professionally.",
    "SO GOOD. I have no feedback on weaknesses. The lectures are interesting, the homework reinforces learning, the tests are fun and engaging.",
    "strengths: professor caters to student learning styles; very organized, does a good job walking through examples\/hw questions",
    "This class is great--no suggestions",
    "I think this class is for more of the individuals who have already a solid background in econ or accounting. This is a whole new way of thinking and I don't think there's enough work to actually do in order to get solid on the material. I have never done decision analysis and two-three questions to practice on before a midterm is silly.",
    "It was difficult to keep up with the course in addition to four other classes. I wish that the course had gone slower, we would have reviewed homework more often, and there was a section for the course where we could reviewed what we learned in lecture that week step by step and teach us how to use Excel\/other programs for doing the problems. However, the professor makes the subject matter fun and I really appreciated having a class that taught real-world skills that I could actually list on my resume when I return to the workforce after this program.",
    "Class was very good - wish that we could learn some more of the intuition for the topics then go through specific programs. Students end up teaching themselves the course material.",
    "Strengths: Challenges you to learn by doing which helped me grasp the concepts better and easily remember them in exams and even in random conversations. Focus on learning so homeworks are graded on effort, so you are not focussed on grades but more on learning",
    "Incredible introductory course to very important modeling and analytical tools. Professor Paltiel is a brilliant instructor.",
    "I think that the homework being ungraded was good. it was nice to work out the problems. i think that part of the problem was that the tests and the homework didn't always line up. for example the final exam was very difficult and did not at all represent whether you understood the material presented in class.",
    "Very interesting subject. It's useful for public health professionals to understand the basics and background of cost-effectiveness and decision-making. The professor was incredibly engaging, funny, and I feel I learned a lot from his lectures. The workload was not overwhelming, and the content of the lessons was thought-provoking.",
    "Good but did not spend enough time on the important stuff and too much time on the non-important stuff",
    "Incredible course. I'm EMD and didn't expect to like the course as much as I did. It was highly recommended to me so I took it trusting the reviews and it was a great decision for me. Even though this material didn't apply to my research directly, I was very glad that I took the course and learned how cost-effective analysis worked because I'm sure it'll come up in my work or research at some point.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course though I did feel extremely frustrated with the exams as I felt the complexity level of the homework didn't prepare us for the exam.",
    "I thought the course was a fantastic introduction to cost-effective analysis. The material presented was interesting, applicable, and engaging. The weekly cases also helped build a strong understanding of the material and the focused on problem-solving and skills-based analysis. I do wish that we spent more time talking about some of the qualitative insights and more complex topics in CEA. For example, I was really interested in preferences\/utilities, and I think it would have been helpful in thinking about how we assign those values, how other countries\/systems determine value. I also thought that the problems worked in the cases were not representative of the types of questions asked on the exam. I would have benefited from additional examples or homework so that I could ensure that I best grasped the material before the exam.",
    "The material is very interesting and every class was a new experience. There were conflicting opinions about whether the structure of the class was helpful or not (with the homework assignment being given with little to no guidance and then having the class period after the assignment as the learning time). I personally found it rewarding because during class I could stay alert and knew exactly what was going on, since I had previously spent quite a few hours on the assignment and been thinking about it. The tests were mostly fair, but the first test had a few questions which I did not feel accurately represented what we learned. Overall, I was pleased with the material and how it was tested. Definitely keep the take-home testing, since it's the best for learning and ruminating over the material.",
    "One of the best classes I've ever taken. Wish there were a second semester taught by Dr. Paltiel.",
    "This is a must take course at YPSH. Dr. Paltiel is energetic and his enthusiasm about the subject is contagious. Each class is really a treat.",
    "Good course",
    "Excellent introductory course for decision marking and cost effectiveness. There are weekly homeworks that should weigh more in the final grade. Overall, midterm and final exams were more challenging than the homeworks.",
    "The instructor for this course is engaging and entertaining in the classroom, however often times he doesn't seem to realize that the students are usually several steps behind him in grasping the material. Many of us are seeing the material he presents for the first time, so flying by and accepting silence as understanding isn't very useful. It's a great class that teaches many skills, but it would be more useful if we worked through the homework solutions in class after we turn it in.",
    "A great class! The lectures are engaging and you feel as if you are learning concrete things every week. I do feel that it moves a bit slow at times and more material could be added, but I do see why it is structured the way it is in how topics are built upon each other. The homework and tests are fair and tries to get at whether you understand the concepts without trying to deliberately trick you.",
    "Great intro to principles and techniques of decision & cost effectiveness analysis. The homeworks were great for explicating concepts learned in class. However, I wish we could have worked on more \"real-life\" clinical examples\/datasets.",
    "Best class! Introduces relevant mathematical frameworks and strategies in a very approachable way for all levels of math thinkers. Layers ethical principles and real-world applications on top of these frameworks for a rich problem-solving experience. Dr. Paltiel makes the course so engaging and fun to be a part of -- I wish this could keep going for more than one semester!",
    "It would have been beneficial to have more thorough feedback on homework assignments either in lecture or a posted answer key.",
    "This is a great introductory course to cost effectiveness analysis. So many of the skills learned here can be applied to real-world situations immediately. Obviously there is so much more that can be learned but overall I recommend this class to anyone in public health.",
    "The course was great at teaching new concepts I had never seen before. There were plenty of great examples and material on the course website to allow for a thorough understanding of the concepts.",
    "I think that the strengths are the topics covered and the professors ability to present them. The weekness is that I didn't received feedback on my homeworks so I wasn't able to learn from my mistakes and correct them before the test. I think that having an online solution of the homeworks would be ideal.",
    "giving students the ability to use CE strategy to analyze problems and various methods to do so. Productive in that you can use this skill outside of the class. weakness- thought that the lectures could have focused more on how to do the homework.",
    "Exams are challenging but David rocks!! Amazing professor, and course is very interesting\/ presented a lot of new material to me that I found useful and intersting",
    "This course was exceptionally interesting, relevant, and enjoyable. The material is challenging but fun to engage with. I felt like I learned an immense amount over the course of the semester. I also feel like I gained tangible skills that will be very applicable to my future work.",
    "I like the class and information, I think the practice problems were good and challenging and provided good practice for the exams. I thonk the one thing tat I really needed was feedback or atleast an answer key on all the homework so I could see if I was understanding the information correctly and would know if I need to get help before it was too late.",
    "This class is GREAT. This course provides you with extremely relevant analytical skills for any profession. If you have never taken a cost-effectiveness analysis course--TAKE THIS ONE! It is a great introduction to making analytical decisions in the context of a number of number of uncertain factors.",
    "- good lectures, online media library was v useful - exams could be extremely difficult given the limited practice we had - I liked the course structure - the homeworks were ungraded and going through the cases in class after attempting them was very useful.",
    "It was a good overview of cost-effectiveness analysis. Challenging but not impossible. Lectures on Prof. Paltiel's work were the most interesting classes.",
    "Great course, insightful and practical application. The lecture videos on classes v2 were of great help.However, the degree of difficulty for the assignments and the examinations were too far apart.",
    "Excellent. Very informative and applicable to a wide range of issues.",
    "One of my favorite courses. I think Paltiel is on to something with his pendulum. You can't please everyone, but he's doing a good job at trying.",
    "Excellent introduction to the topic of CEA and policy",
    "Strengths- I feel like I learned valuable skills in this course. I learned the importance of cost benefit analysis and the true meaning of cost effectiveness in medical decision making. I thought this was one of the most important classes I have taken so far at YSPH. I think this should be a mandatory class for all students to take. I felt the class was very practical and applicable to the professional world of healthcare. The lecture recordings were an extra plus, I would refer back to them every time I worked on a homework assignment. Thank you for recording your lectures! Weaknesses- The teaching instructor to this class was missing the entire time. She was responsive to emails, but did not make an effort to actively help students throughout the semester.",
    "Exams are much harder than homework and lectures",
    "Interesting content, very applicable concepts.",
    "good teaching",
    "Loved this course. People have mixed reviews, but as someone who took this course as an elective I found it very different and one of the most challenging courses, but one of the most rewarding. Take home assignments took me very very long, but I feel I learned greatly from them themselves. Would love to see some type of final project built in - but time is so limited. Loved the engaging instructor, during a difficult attention time in the day (Wed 4pm is a sleepy time for all of us students). Challenging, but appreciated how intentional the instructor was with adapting the course.",
    "A great introduction to cost effectiveness analysis. The course fundamentally shaped my approach to thinking critically about cost in public health interventions. I greatly appreciated that course lectures and materials were posted promptly online, which made completing problem sets and reviewing for exams much easier."

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0I have no suggestions for improvement. David is my favorite professor.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Wonderful instructor. But I feel like the difficulty is reversed. THe homework is similar to class instruction and the midterms finals are so unique that I struggled. THe homework should be harder and the tests easier. I would prefer more homework that is harder to help me sharpen my skills",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Excellent instructor who is very invested in his students.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0The instructor is entertaining and intelligent, although he taught the course unfairly in my opinion. I think putting a question on the first exam, deliberately, that no student has ever seen before in his class notes was unfair. In the future, I think the instructor should test students on topics they have been exposed to at some point during class time or through readings.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Engaging lecturer.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0He is a great professor. He is passionate about the material and teaches it very well",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0David is great, but his tests are not representative of the lectures. The videos are great to use to revisit a concept. Midterms are ridiculously hard taking into consideration that there really is not much practice prior. You can also tell that David is riding out the semesters, not really working too hard.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0One of my most engaging professors this semester, very receptive to student feedback. I really appreciated his sense of humor, the examples from his work, and the presentation of cost-effectiveness within the context of the real world.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Awesome! and very considerate",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0I thought Dr. Paltiel was a great instructor--he was clear, engaging, and very passionate about his work. I think he presented complex insights in meaningful and manageable ways; however, I do wish we had spent a little bit more time on the theory behind some of the assumptions we were making in the problems. (For example, rationality. I would have been interested to think about how something like cumulative prospect theory is integrated into CEA) I liked that he recorded his lectures for viewing, and he was always very accessible and responsive to questions. I do feel like he could have spent a little more time on the mathematics behind some of the models, but that could by my own bias of interest.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0He is a good instructor.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Excellent instructor very kind, easy going, and with high dominion of the topic.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0The instructor is definitely engaging in the classroom and provides a lot of levity that is necessary to keep the class's attention. Dr. Paltiel's strength is that he's entertaining and enthusiastic, which makes people like the class. His weakness is that often times he flies by the material and expects students to immediately grasp concepts that have just been presented to them. Only the theory of several topics gets covered in class and we never see the actual practice or problems worked out for several chapters. If Dr. Paltiel could work through at least one or two homework problems each week before class that would be very helpful.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Wonderful! I appreciate most the way David ties the topics in class with his own work and other work in the field so you can see the application of cost-effective analyses. I also appreciate how he does go a little more in-depth into certain topics (while stating that it's completely optional) so you can see how it gets more complicated (and more realistic).",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Brilliant, kind, thoughtful, hilarious, engaging. I could go on. Take this class. Paltiel knows the material like the back of his hand. He's been teaching for long enough that he is able to focus on the nuances of teaching. He is skilled. He is passionate. He is compassionate. Do it.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Prof. Paltiel was extremely engaging as a lecturer and explained concepts clearly. Was a pleasure to be in class.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is a phenomenal instructor who ensures the coursework is interesting, applicable, and accessible to students of all backgrounds. Not only is the course interesting in a hands-on problem solving way, Dr. Paltiel makes it funny and fun to engage with. The way the homework is designed and then solutions taught in class is a great way to engage students in the problem solving process. Only weakness is perhaps to not tell students \"it's okay\" to fall asleep in some of the more lecture heavy lectures... I think this led me to spacing out when I really wish I was paying closer attention! Amazing to have all lectures recorded online to revisit.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0Dr. Paltiel is fantastic! In addition to being a very welcoming professor he is conscious of the subject knowledge of the students in his class and welcomes their input. He was careful to make sure that he did everything possible to help his students.",

    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0David is amazing! He genuinely cares about his students and his class so much. He is flexible but also has his class down to a T. It runs like a well oiled machine. He has such interesting experiences to share and is downright hilarious.",
    "Instructor: A David Paltiel \u00a0He is hilarious--there wasn't one lecture that wasn't entertaining. He presents the information in a very comprehensive way and ensures that all students are kept up to speed. He is very reasonable and supportive of students.

A joy to be with in the classroom, only wished that more examples or practice problems could be provided for students to try. Instructor is highly knowledgeable, and loved hearing about his research work and all of the applications of cost effectiveness shown. The video of the courses was SUPER helpful - more courses at YSPH should do this!",

    "It's kind of like a very introductory industrial\/systems engineering course--if you like technical problems, you'll really enjoy it. I recommend.",
    "if you are HPM, you have to take this course or Public Health Law (though by no means does the material overlap in my opinion) and just grin and bear it. If you don't have to take this class, there are better ways to spend your time especially if you have no background in the subject.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this. The best advice that I have gotten was take this class, and I'm passing that advice on to you.",
    "Problem solving is fun and this has real world implications. Don't be fooled by the homework, the take home finals are a (insert not nice word).",
    "I would recommend the course if the student wanted to learn about interesting topics, although I would warn him\/her that the course structure is poor.",
    "YES, TAKE IT. IT IS SO GOOD.",
    "highly recommend because the content covered is extremely useful whether you are directly involved in cost-effectiveness analyses or will need to know how to interpret them. Paltiel teaches the course in as painless a way as possible and is highly entertaining",
    "The course is a general sampling of business decision analysis and cost-effectiveness. I think if you really want to learn the material, go take a similar class that's in depth at the business school. This was just an introduction. Otherwise, for those of us who probably won't ever use the stuff again, not sure it was optimal use of my time.",
    "A challenging class that an entertaining professor who teaches you practical skills. It requires a LOT of time each week to do the reading and do the homework. Exams are difficult, but take-home at least. I would suggest waiting until the second year of the program to take the class.",
    "This course is awesome! Challenging enough to make you struggle for a little bit but not enough to make you cry.",
    "Great class that teaches useful skills- be prepared to spend a great deal of time outside the classroom teaching yourself the material.",
    "Prof Paltiel believes in the learning by doing principle. As such, I managed to actually work through all the course content on my own, struggle through it, then ultimately come up with a better understanding of the material on my own before discussing it in class. Class sessions were spent reviewing the concepts and then solidifying what we had done the previous week. Exams are fair, homeworks are graded on effort, the content is extremely relevant to future career in health policy and management. Overall, a great class to take",
    "I will recommend this course to students who have interest in it but not major in it.",
    "A must take elective - necessary to work hard if you come with no baseline knowledge, get as much as you put in to the course.",
    "great course. only expect honors if cost effectiveness analysis is your skill.",
    "cool way to think about things but this new perspective and I think good for us to have taken. . It's required.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who is interested in policy decision-making and wants a challenging introduction course--I would caution them to expect to work hard and put in the necessary time. I did find the course extremely useful as a and have a much deeper understanding of costs and values in policy-making.",
    "This is a great intro to modeling and understanding how to make better decisions. I feel much better prepared to interpret a lot of data now, and want to take more coursework in modeling to strengthen this. For a policy or management student, this course is a great introduction to decision making when operating within a limited budget.",
    "Absolutely take it. One of the best courses at YSPH.",
    "Informative",
    "Take this class!!",
    "good course",
    "It is a great course to take.",
    "Recommended, a great class",
    "Overall great introductory course for decision making and cost effectiveness analysis, is not a course for implementing rather than key concepts for better understanding of the published literature. Weekly homeworks are fair but should account for more of the final grade. Midterm, final, and homeworks should be concurrent in their difficulty level. Dr Paltiel excellent instructor amongst the best in YSPH.",
    "I would recommend it because I believe it teaches valuable skills that all MPH students should know however I believe there are certain adjustments that could be made in its teaching style.",
    "Generally a self taught class with those who have a natural tendency toward this sort of material at a bit of an advantage. Nevertheless it's a great class and I learned a lot",
    "I have taken more than 40 credits at Yale and this was certainly among my top 5 favorite courses, if not my favorite course. You will learn real, applicable modeling techniques; think about challenging, practical questions; and benefit from the world-class brilliance that is David Paltiel. Do yourself a favor: take this class.",
    "Such a fun course, particularly for those who enjoy problem solving and want to think about cost-effectiveness in medical strategy. I would definitely recommend it. Dr. Paltiel encourages students to think and problem-solve in a way that is very unique to most courses taught at YSPH.",
    "Just take the class. You won't regret it.",
    "yes",
    "This course is a great introduction to decision making and cost effectiveness analysis. It is a change of focus from much of the course content at YSPH and I would recommend this for anyone who think they might be interested in the course material.",
    "I would recommend it, it is one of the more applied and helpful classes I have taken at YSPH and it is truly enjoyable.",
    "giving students the ability to use CE strategy to analyze problems and various methods to do so. Productive in that you can use this skill outside of the class.",
    "Fantastic course. David is one of the best teachers I've had and the course offers a really interesting take on an important public health decision making process. Exams and homeworks are challenging but fair.",
    "This course will help you gain a toolbox for approaching issues of cost-effective analysis and decision making. It will help your analytic and critical thinking mind, especially if you are not a naturally quantitative thinker. It will be fun, challenging, and very rewarding.",
    "This course includes weekly (short) readings and 1 or 2 case studies to complete for homework. The course this year had 2 take home midterms and 1 take home final that asked questions to similar to those on the homework. I thought the take home style of the exams was a great way to really grasp and absorb the information. I developed skills in this course that will be applicable to any field I go into.",
    "Great course, v interesting and useful. Weekly workload is light, but take home exams take a long time",
    "Excellent introduction to cost-effective analysis. Highly recommended to all.",
    "General overview of cost-effective analysis with witty weekly practice problems. Great course that everyone in public health should take, regardless of discipline.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. I am so glad to have had the opportunity to take it during my time at YSPH. It should be a mandatory course for all to take. The course covered material that is applicable to any profession in healthcare and Dr. Paltiel made the course both interesting and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, everyone should take it!",
    "yes recommend",
    "Loved this course! As an elective, I highly recommend. Gives you a basic skillset around cost effectiveness and decision analysis, applicable to all departments of study. Will be a time consuming course, but worth it if you are willing to put in the time to learn the skills and methods. Strong course, definitely take! Instructor is absolutely a wonderful human.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class. Though a bit heavy on quantitative material, the course is accessible to anyone, regardless of math background. I highly enjoyed the course and know that I will use the concepts and techniques I learned in my future career as a public health professional."
