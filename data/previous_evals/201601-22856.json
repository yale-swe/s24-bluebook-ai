    "PHAR 529 provides an introduction to structural biology techniques and their applications in drug discovery. I would recommend this class to other students because I found it enjoyable and informative. It will definitely benefit me throughout my graduate studies.",
    "Yes, anyone who is performing structural research should take this class. Even if you aren't, it is a helpful class.",
    "I would recommend PHAR 529. You are exposed to many different topics and can meet different Pharmacology professors. However, because there are so many different professors, it is hard to organize.",
    "Summarizes research methods common to pharmacology. Overall, a good course.",
    "Yes",
    "Structural Pharmacology is suited for students who intend to use biochemical and biophysical techniques in their research, particularly in the pharmacology department at Yale where many investigators are interested in kinase signaling. I would recommend the course to another student because it highlights several useful techniques and gives the student an idea of the resources available to him\/her at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "As I am hoping to use structural biology techniques in my research, this course provided me with a solid foundation into the different techniques at my disposal.",
    "It was good getting to meet most of the pharmacology professors and becoming exposed to their research. I was already familiar with most of the first module (NMR, Mass spec, protein basics, crystallography, cryo-EM) because I had been exposed to those topics through a different course. My research is somewhat related to the topics.",
    "Provided me with a good crash course on kinases that has been very useful to me.",
    "This course provided a very comprehensive description of kinase signaling, which is directly related to my current research interests. It also provided me with a suite of techniques that I will be taking advantage of over the next few years as a graduate student."
