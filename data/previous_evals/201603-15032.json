    "A very in-depth analysis of common pollutants that are organic nature and a summary of all the variables to understanding their patterns and behavior.",

    "Basic knowledge of organic chemistry",
    "I developed a greater understanding of organic chemistry and its prevalence in the environment. I learned a lot about its transportation and a multitude about mitigation strategies. This class is great for higher level students interested in environmental problems relating to organic pollutants.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The knowledge I obtained in this class feels genuinely important and I feel much better about my ability to understand this field. A great combination of on problem solving, context, and cases that reflect decision making in the real world. I did learn a lot and the professor and TA were there to help. Weaknesses:It just felt a little too isolated from some of the most major implications with the primary example being health. I understand health effects were not the focus but I feel like it was almost never talked about at all, even where adding context could help strengthen another level. This could probably be addressed by expanding the toxicity lesson. I also wish there was a little emphasis on what non-organic pollutants are. Again, that little bit of context (maybe half a class) talking about genuine differences between common non-organic pollutants. I just feel like my knowledge is not totally complete and it feels weird that I still don't know anything about certain plastics for example.",
    "more case studies would be nice, but a lot of information is learned within the time frame of the semester",
    "Professor Anisfeld makes this course interesting and fun to attend every Tuesday and Thursday. His lectures and presentation make the course what it is.",
    "super well organized and moves at a fast enough pace to be engaging but slow enough to not loose us--overall a great class"

    "yes! absolutely, this was easily the best course i took at yale this semester. probably the only class where i learned anything.",
    "Yes, but only after taking organic chemistry",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to students who have a real interest in organic pollutants.",
    "Yes! Shimi is an awesome super engaging lecturer who really cares about his class--he gives a great overview of how organic pollutants function in the environment. Everything is well organized, you are always given printouts of his slides to take notes on and have a good sense of how to study for his tests so as long as you put the work in its really geared for you to learn a lot and succeed. Also even if you don't have an amazing background in organics there's a nice crash course few videos that Shimi has to get you up to speed.",
    "A good class for learning both fundamental chemistry concepts that influence pollutant behaviour in the environment, as well as particular pollutants and remediation management strategies. Well taught with many assessments."
