    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if you're new to the Environmental Engineering field. Mr. Peccia is a great teacher and you will learn a lot!",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of biological processes and is appropriate for students with some or no previous exposure to the subject. Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, particularly in the student indicated interest in the subject matter.",
    "It is an introduction to environmental biotechnology emphasizing microbial kinetics and engineering principles (e.g. mass balance). Applications discussed included wastewater treatment, environmental remediation, and biofuel production.Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "I do recommend this course, especially for student who is major in Environmental Engineering. Because it provides the most cutting-edge techniques for contaminant control or new resource exploring."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided an excellent introduction to biological processes. The unit on biofilms may be especially useful in future research.",
    "1) This course was the first real education I've received in an area critical in my profession. I feel like this course has prepared me such that I could have a reasonably intelligent discussion about a biological topic with a colleague of mine.2) None of my research directly involves biotechnology, however some of the material early in the class on biomolecules was helpful and relevant to my research.",
    "As my research interest is in microbial processes, this course helps me understand basics in this field and solved many of my problems."
