    "Minjoo is a fantastic teacher, perhaps one of the best engineering professors I've had thus far at Yale. Take it.",
    "Covers relatively large amounts of new material within just one semester, but that's what also makes it fun and exciting at points. Glad that I finally know (at least at some level) how audio filters and mixer tables work, and how you can use basic semiconductor devices to do really cool things. Labs are a pain though (as they probably always are), but it's also an additional piece of work that's not immediately apparent when the course first starts, so be prepared for that \/ take that into consideration before taking the class.",
    "An excellent course! Prof. Minjoo Lee is the best you can ask for. Just take the class. Amazing.",
    "Take it if you are interested at all, dont take it if you just need a qr or sc credit.",
    "Great introduction to circuits. Would recommend.",
    "Solid overview of circuits and a good intro to EE. You do mainly analog stuff (DC analysis, time varying signals, transient response) for the first 3\/4 of the course, then switch to digital logic for the last bit. The problem sets aren't too bad, but the labs can be abit tricky (especially the last one). All in all, if Minjoo is teaching it, take it with him.",
    "Take this if you're at all interested in electronics, since between the lab and lecture you'll pick up really practical and relevant electronics knowledge and skills. Professor Lee is great: he's enthusiastic about what he's teaching, and went to the trouble to learn everyone's names early on despite the ~50 person class size. Lectures are easy to follow, though the structure and in-class examples are often taken straight from the book. The homework is reasonable and the three midterm exams were relatively difficult but fair. You'll get to do some cool projects in the lab, and the lab reports help you make sure you really understand what you're doing without adding too much extra work (usually). As long as you're coming in with a rudimentary understanding of what a circuit is (i.e. had a circuitry unit in high school physics) you should be set for a pretty enjoyable class.",
    "Extremely challenging electronics course that should be worth 1.5 credits. There is a lab every week, in addition to the two lectures, that some weeks took me 6+ hours to complete. Tests were very challenging, but won't decide your grade. I learned a ton and would recommend to anyone who wants to learn circuitry and electronics.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone who may be interested in EE or EE\/CS.",
    "The psets, lab sessions, and lab reports for this class definitely put the work load on the higher end of the spectrum. But Lee does a good job teaching the course, he managed to keep me interested most of the time, and I feel like I learned a lot of useful stuff.",
    "I would recommend this class to any engineer. I would not recommend this class to someone just looking to learn about electronics out of interest since this class is a lot of work and can get tough at times. I knew nothing about the subject coming in and it was a struggle at first but looking back now I see how much useful stuff I actually learned. Professor lee is great. There is a 3 hour lab and a lab report (about 4-5 hours) once a week even though it's one credit. This definitely added to the toughness of the class.",
    "EE 200 is a tough class, but do-able. Professor Lee is a great guy, and a great professor. The labs are pretty difficult, but they are rewarding. It may not be a good first EE class to take, but it is a good class.",
    "I would not recommend EENG 200 to another student unless they need it to complete the requirements for their major.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, especially if the lab + lab report without an extra half credit component sticks around. A lot of tedium without a whole of of information that seems relevant to other fields gained.",
    "For how complicated electrical engineering and circuitry can get, this class is very straight forward and gives you a good foundation. If you're interested in the subject and aren't terrible at math, I'd suggest taking it.",
    "Excellent course. More work than expected (homework plus lab write ups), but thoroughly enjoyable. Feels good to know how the stuff around us works. Take it with professor Lee, he's and excellent professor. I had heard bad things about the teaching of the previous professor.",
    "For my mechanical engineering majors out there, you should take this class as one of your electives. You should know how circuits work because when they do work, they are pretty cool. In regards to the class in general, I'd break it down into two parts: lecture and lab. Professor Lee is like a breath of fresh air in the electrical engineering department. Though the material itself can be a bit dry, Professor Lee is cracks jokes and keeps the class entertained nonetheless. The exams were fair, and he even let us extend lab deadlines when we asked! The lab is way more time than it appears. In fact, plan on an extra 4 - 5 hours a week for this class, including writing up the lab report and doing the lab itself. Lab is not the greatest as electric circuits can be quite sensitive, but you do learn a lot through your struggles. Though sometimes this class gave me a headache, at the end of the day I'd recommend it. It can be intense at times, but I did learn a lot as a result.",
    "This course is excellent if you're at all interested in circuitry or Electrical Engineering. It'll give you a very good overview of basic circuits and is a great course for seeing if Electrical Engineering is right for you. Try to get it with Minjoo \"Larry\" Lee, though, because he is unbeLEEievably good. Lectures, which you would imagine would be boring in a circuits class, are instead punctuated by Prof's jokes, which left me reLEEieved. homework is manageable, though labs range from easy to almost impossible. Don't worry though, help if you want it is not LEEan. Really a good course.",
    "EENG 200 is an interesting course, but I don't think I'd recommend it unless it is required for your major. I also don't think I'd recommend it as a litmus test for the feasibility of EENG as a major (i.e. if you aren't sure if you want to be an EENG major, don't base it on this class alone). It can feel very dry at times, because it is about circuits, but also has very interesting moments (especially if you are interested in audio applications).",
    "If you want to learn more about basic circuits I would take this class.",
    "More work than the material's worth, especially the labs. Only take if required."
