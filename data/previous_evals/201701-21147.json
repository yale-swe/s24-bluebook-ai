    "Very thorough and rigorous exploration of advanced concepts in grammar. Not much to improve the course, it is what it is. Kind of boring, but when is grammar not boring- definitely helps improve one's spanish grammar. While I would have liked more speaking, it was made clear that its not largely a conversation course. More a failing on the department for not offering more speaking-based classes than a problem with the class, given its purpose is to teach grammar.",
    "There was a high level of engagement and constant work to be doing so it was helpful in that sense; it may be improved by practicing dialogue and conversation more, or maybe doing activities.",
    "Fantastic teaching style. Love the powerpoints and the handouts!! Very helpful."
