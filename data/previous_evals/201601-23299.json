    "William was articulate and clear in his instruction.",
    "This course was adequately taught, but too brief and superficial to be a useful overview of a complex topic. I strongly feel that the 1 credit professional skills courses are a poor system for learning, even when taught by a capable professor like William. Because of this, the course is ultimately a waste of time.",
    "In regards to pace, there was a lot of material covered in four weeks. I think it would be helpful to offer this as a half semester (ten week) course, rather than trying to cram all of the tools and topics into four weeks.",
    "Q 9: Professor Vance is extremely open and responsive to student questions and comments. He was very happy to pause his lectures to discuss any ideas or questions that came up, and encouraged student participation.",
    "These are general comments pertaining to the question sets as a whole. Speaking directly to students considering the course: if you need or want to enhance your communication skills as a professional in science and the environment, take the class. The exercises are on point and truly helpful. The one on one and peer coaching are very valuable. Exercises include presentation of topics, participation on a debate panel, development of one's \"elevator speech\" about one's career goals and more! William Vance is a warm, clear, engaging, professional and responsive communicator and coach. He models what he preaches, and he knows how to coach others to improve their skill. Those he has chosen to work with him as break-out group coaches are well qualified also and work as a team to be sure all students have an equivalent and valuable experience.",
    "This class was extremely helpful, I wish I could take it again! The course could be even more effective if it was longer. There was often not enough class time to go over all of the material or analyze\/discuss in-depth."

   "comments": [
    "Honing useful skills for public speaking, writing, and presenting.",
    "Small group breakout groups that are continued throughout the course, with the same people (for the most part), but different coaches. Great component of class!",
    "Public speaking practice was very helpful.",
    "The power point presentations we did and videoing of ourselves",
    "The first two weeks of presentation practice, recorded with feedback, were particularly helpful.",
    "The audio and video evaluation of the speaking techniques provided the opportunity for useful and actionable feedback that will make you a more compelling speaker.",
    "This course is easy to learn, taught very well, applicable in all fields and would be useful lifelong.",
    "Getting to practice giving and listening to speeches. Nothing's more helpful than getting to practice and receiving immediate feedback.",
    "Splitting the class in smaller groups was a great idea that allowed for more interaction and exchange of ideas and suggestions. Recording our presentations was also a great way to really grasp how other people perceive us as we present. It led to a personal assessment of our presentation techniques.",
    "the coaching part of the course was the best aspect",
    "This is one of the most applicable courses at FES. It gives you simple tips and tools to use in your communication, and I have already implemented a lot of them in academic and professional settings. I really enjoyed working in small groups with my peers, it was nerve-racking to present to my friends\/peers during the consecutive weeks but it also bonded us closer and we all gave each other great feedback and support. Being recorded and critiqued increased my awareness of what I needed to work on and I really think it made me improve or at least be more cognizant of how I present myself in different communication settings.",
    "The course was very trim and on-target, getting quickly to the week's goals.",
    "How concrete it was.",
    "The parts I enjoyed the most were the practice of different communication techniques",
    "Practicing presenting in front of your peers and hearing their feedback."

   "comments": [
    "This class could easily span an entire semester. I wish we had more time to develop some of the skills we began working on in class.",
    "None!",
    "Found the panel and networking sections to be less useful.",
    "Perhaps give us the assignments to do right before class rather than take home to prepare because we always had to tweak them before our delivery and this often times felt rushed and diminished the value of the lesson being taught.",
    "The sections on participating in negotiations, participating on panels, and leading a meeting weren't very helpful because the topics were given upon arrival in class. It would have been valuable to have the topics in advance to adequately prepare. It didn't simulate a real-world environment, and was therefore not very useful to practice participating with no knowledge of the topic.",
    "The coaches provided general encouragement and basic critique, but I felt that in all of my groups the feedback could have been more intense. People should be able to received constructive criticism and need to be sure that they are getting the whole truth about their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "The course was organized extremely well. Taking the structure as given, I can't think of any improvements. If the course structure itself can be changed, I might suggest focusing on fewer topics because the course is so short. For example, dropping the module on how to run a meeting would allow for more depth in the module on public speaking. But this is based on my personal interests, and might not reflect what students in the class would want overall.",
    "The course could be stretched to a full-semester course. It was too short.",
    "It would be great if the course had more than 1 credit.",
    "Would have liked more time spent on negotiation",
    "Honestly, I am hard-pressed to think of anything! Here is one thought: it would be good to provide a modestly larger amount of reference material for post-course use.",
    "It would be better to promote more natural ways of communication. At times I felt that applying what was taught could lead to communicating in ways that seemed overly prepared and stiff.",

This course will help you relay ideas to a lay audience, make you more confident in being an advocate for your self, and will be a useful life-long tool that will enhance and showcase the other skills you have learned at FES.",
    "These skills are applicable to any program, really.",
    "This course is fit into my program, especially on improving my speech, presentation, interview skills",
    "Communication is a key skill in any field but within the environmental field we are constantly pulling together different disciplines and needing to educate or convince an audience of why a problem matters. I found this course to be extremely relevant for other projects I will, for which presentations are usually required. Also in my seminars when I express a thought, it's like a mini-presentation and so knowing I do things like uptalking or speak to quickly has helped me improve in classroom discussions.",
    "This course was exactly what I needed to take the next steps in communicating well as a science and environment professional. We worked on demeanor, confidence, staying on message, respecting one's audience, providing interesting information, listening and much more.",
    "Communication can fit in any program but for me personally I am going to use public speaking techniques that I learned in this class to moderate and conduct meetings",

It was tough because of the time of day and length of the class, but it was totally worth it. The small groups broke up the monotony of a lecture-type class, and I was always energized after it, which is not typical for an nearly 3-hr evening class on Mondays.",
