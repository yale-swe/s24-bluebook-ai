    "I learnt a lot about what design really is. Its pretty much exactly as the syllabus says, which is a good thing!",
    "I learned a ton about how to place forms in visual space to convey a persuasive message. I learned how to create a logo, a brand identity, a brochure, and a series of posters on an issue. I also learned a lot of design vocabulary and concepts, and I learned to use those to critique my work and the work of others in a workshop setting.",
    "I learned about the basic principles of graphic design",
    "I learned fundamental skills around composition, visual hierarchy and clarity of message.",
    "basic design principles, what to look for in a design work, how to effectively design brochures, posters with proper typography, message, and visual elements",
    "I learned a lot of industry-applicable terminology and felt like I developed my sense of style and balance a lot more.",
    "I gained an overview of design principles and developed my own stylistic imprint in my creations.",
    "Saw the world through a new lens of branding\/identity",
    "Fundamentals of graphic design (composition, balance, asymmetry, etc), how to approach typography, conveying messages through design.",
    "I gained a larger vocabulary for talking about design as well as a more conscious eye for creating two dimensional design.",
    "I learned so much about the basics of graphic design, especially having no background. We learned basic terms, as well as more successful designers and concepts.",
    "Some basic graphic design principles"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - fun, great Professor, different to normal work Weaknesses - ... not really any",
    "I truly enjoyed this class. The workshops are very helpful and well paced. The assignments were the right level of challenge, and the right amount of work. I came to really appreciate the requirement that we not use the computerI'm sold that computers kill creativity. And I thought the pacing of the class, and the looseness of the syllabus, worked as well. I never felt stressed or overwhelmed.",
    "This course was fun to take because I got to think more about projects and work that I see in the world all the time. I also have a new appreciation for art and its impact on the world. The only weakness is the amount of work, also it was made clear to the class that the grade was more based on effort and dedication, however I felt as though it was more based off of talent, which many students came into the course with no previous knowledge.",
    "The strength was in the heavy work load and the variety of assignment types. The weakness was the size of the group - I feel that a smaller group would have allowed for more in-depth conversations and critiques.",
    "Overall very solid course, the example artwork was very inspiring, and the structure of how it was taught really helped to bring together all the abstract concepts.",
    "This course is primarily done through peer critiques, with assignments having little instruction. You do things, then you learn what you were supposed to do. While this is valuable, perhaps more lecturing on what is expected\/what makes something good would be better.",
    "Strengths: did a lot of cool projects and learned a lot from the critiques Weaknesses: while I appreciated the value in making everything by hand, it made a lot of my designs limited by what could feasibly be constructed by hand",
    "Don't come into this class expecting to become an expert with adobe illustrator\/Photoshop\/indesign. There is the opportunity to use it for some cases, but Henk pushes us to do everything by hand (this meant many hours spent cutting and pasting with an xacto knife and elmers glue). Don't let this detract you from taking the course though -- in some ways it gave us more control over our work.",
    "I think it was very early in the morning, but other than that the course was very well taught and planned!!",
    "Honestly Henk didn't really lecture much, just assigned projects and critiqued them but I would have valued and appreciated more direct lecturing sometimes. For example, a color lecture or something."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Henk is so fun! He loves to challenge your thoughts to help you figure out what you really want to present and what the best way to do that is. Dont take the class if you arent going to try and step outside of the easy things you know.",
    "This class is fantastic and fun, no matter whether you plan to pursue graphic design afterward or just want to learn the basics. Henk is a discerning, talented, and supportive instructorhis comments in workshop are honest and incredibly helpful, his individual critiques (twice in the semester) were great, and he very generously organized a trip to New York to see his studio at the end of semester. Each of the assignmentsbrand identity, brochure, posterwas challenging but fun, and I loved seeing my classmates' work. The class is quite a bit of work, but if you're prepared to take that on, I couldn't recommend it more!",
    "Yes as long as they are aware of the work load and they are willing to understand that past knowledge and experience does play a role, even tho it is said it does not",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although I wish there was a graduate-only equivalent course.",
    "if interested in graphic design but have not much background, this is a great course",
    "Yes, it helps you develop your understanding of what makes a designed work good, and through that helps you improve your own work",
    "If youre willing to put the work in, you will gain a nice portfolio and a new way to see the created visual world around you.",
    "Yes, if one is interested in getting involved in graphic design (might be a lot of work for someone just trying to see what graphic design is like though)",
    "Absolutely. It will change the way you view the world through a design lens, and open gateways for further graphic design courses. Only take if you are willing to put in the work. Certainly a class where you only get out what you put in.",
    "Yes!",
    "I was totally recommend this course. It was well planned and the professor was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He was understanding and showed a very deep knowledge on design and terms.",
    "I don't regret taking it but I don't necessarily recommend it. Didn't super learn much."
