    "Great lab course. Never been in a lab that is simultaneously as demoralizing and rewarding. It really complements the lecture and you learn quite a bit, but due to the nature of electrophysiology you may have days with absolutely no or little data to show for it. Thankfully, data is all shared collaboratively for use in the lab reports, which are reasonably graded.",
    "As a premed who has taken a lot of lab classes, really one of the most enjoyable labs I've taken. It really helped me digest the material in lecture and helped me learn a lot of the material. The only drawback is that the lab runs late almost every week, so you never really know when you're going to get out.",
    "good course because students have opportunity to conduct experiments on their own with guidance, students will learn a lot and gain a lot out of this course, labs are really really long though",
    "It might not be the worst lab you've taken, but it can still be a drag. Prof. Wyman talks for a really long time, so the first few classes with him might seem like they'll never end; afterward, Prof. Keshishian and Prof. Burke switch off, so it's more bearable, but you still shouldn't expect to get out of lab before 6. Most of your experiments, which are often 2-4 weeks long, will fail. The grading policy is really ambiguous.",
    "The lab is LONG. You will get out at around 6 every week. However, its definitely one of my favorite labs I've taken here. The lab follows pretty closely along with the lecture, and its pretty cool to see the things you've learned in lecture actually happen in lab. The TAs and professors who teach this course are all super nice and knowledgable. So, yes, take this course if you're looking for a fun lab to take.",
    "The lab is a great complement to the lecture - a lot of the things we do are very interesting and its nice to see how everything connects. We do stay for a long time though (sometimes until 6:30) but most of the labs (when things work out) are very rewarding and the professors (including Brett) and the TAs make a great team",
    "I would take this lab again. If you like neuro at all and would like to gain a better understanding of it through (awesome) experimentation, then definitely go for it. You should be taking the lecture alongside the class. Really interesting material and GREAT professors and TA's. I guess it's clear that I really liked this class. Not sure how grading is as of now, but there are weekly quizzes out of 10 pts and 6 lab reports that bring together a couple of labs, each graded out of 5 pts."
