   "comments": [
    "It's a very well structured course for improving your writing skills, but it's a lot of work, and probably would not recommend it to students just looking for an easy language credit. I took it for my major, but I will say my writing improved immensely thanks to this class.",
    "This course focuses on improving one's written Spanish skills. Students write various compositions, including an autobiography, a descriptive piece, a narrative, and an expository essay. There is one in-class composition that is an argument essay, as well as one midterm. All of the compositions are worked on in drafts, with peer editing in the intermediate stages. At the end of the semester, students write an 8-10 page research paper. I highly recommend that students take this class before taking any courses in upper level literature, for it provides the necessary skills for writing a high-quality Spanish essay.",
    "Interesting readings, lots of writing. Definitely recommend if you want to improve your Spanish writing, especially for native speakers."
