    "Nope; take legit any other class.",
    "I would recommend first order logic. I genuinely enjoyed doing the homework and it was a cool way of thinking. Beware - this isn't as easy of a class as it seems. Be prepared to have to work on some of the psets.",
    "Great class!! Very fascinating course material if you like this stuff! Brilliantly taught by Professor Whittle - clear, well-structured lectures. Minimal workload: weekly problem sets (not very time consuming and not very difficult), and 3 exams. Exams are fair (just slightly tricky). Professor Whittle seems like a nice person with a great sense of humor! Section was helpful; Kelley (my TF) was very nice!",
    "it's sorta inane but actually probably less inane than most classes you can take as distributional requirements.",
    "It's just logic.",
    "Logic is fun! It's a useful skill, especially for philosophy, and it's not very difficult. Lots of puzzles and games - just read the textbook and go to lecture and you oughtn't have any problems. Good QR, I suppose.",
    "A terrible class. Lectures were useless, book was confusing, computer program was frustrating. Only saving grace was that my TA was the only one to actually explain what the heck was going on in the class and on the homeworks. If you take it, don't even bother going to lecture it doesn't help and as attractive as Bruno is, it's a waste of your time to go and listen to him repeat word-for-word what's on the slides (which will later be trimmed down for clarity and posted online anyway). The homework will be THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING you will ever do. You will ALMOST get the proof right except for one little thing that the program won't even give you any hints on, and you won't be able to turn it in and get that 100 on it since it's wrong. Tests are difficult. They trick you with an easy first midterm, but the next two will be miserable. You will not finish in the allotted time and Bruno will turn the lights off on you to make you stop writing. I highly recommend a different class, especially if you're just looking for a manageable QR.",
    "Very interesting material but not such an easy class. Makes you think differently. Online homework is an absolute nightmare. Tests were long and difficult. Good class to credit D.",
    "Highly recommended course.",
    "Might seem like a gut at first, but gets harder as the semester goes by. Not quite what I was expecting from a logic course, since we're restricted to programs that only allow us to deal with geometric figures...As a humanities major, I think I could have found a more interesting QR.",
    "This class is a supposed \"gut\" QR course, though I found the material very difficult near the middle of the class. Near the end of the class, I was able to \"get it\", having worked extensively with my TF, Jon Vertanen. If you have ever done coding or computer science, then I believe this class will probably be very easy for you. In a sense, the material is like a logical game of sorts (think akin to LSAT logic games). So, if you are interested in Law, I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. Also, if you need a QR, I could recommend this class since, compared to other QR classes at Yale, it's probably a gut class.",
    "A course that is probably a bit different from what you're expecting. In theory it sounds pretty interesting--we use logic all the time, so maybe it would be cool to know a bit more about how it works. But the class isn't at all about the theory of logic. You spend the semester learning the First Order Logic language (think sort of like a programming language for logic) and the rules for using it to prove things. Lecture is uninteresting; the homework is all digital and takes maybe 3 hours each week, maybe 4 or 5 if you're skipping lecture. The course might be interesting if you're a compsci-type person or even a math-type person, but if you're into the humanities and think this course is going to be a neat introduction to how logic works, you're probably better off not taking it.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is mostly proofs and translations. It involves converting English arguments into a more precise language and proving things. Professor Whittle is a great professor, and the TFs were extremely helpful. However, I would like to add a note of caution: this class is sometimes very thorny. You are never sure what to expect. The problem sets are on the computer (and they are extremely complicated) but then the exams are on paper. The exams varied widely in difficulty. There was always a strong undercurrent of anxiety, because no one really knew what to expect. Basically, I am saying that you should not just wander into this class because you like philosophy\/ thought it would be cool\/ need a QR. If you feel ok about the idea of doing proofs, then go for it. Otherwise, think about it a bit harder before you decide to take it!",
    "Phil 115 is a good introduction to First Order Logic and proof writing. I'm a person who enjoys math and decided to take Phil 115 as my fifth class. The workload is VERY manageable and the exams are really straightforward. If you are looking for an easy QR, this is the class for you. If you are a math person looking for an interesting math-related course, look elsewhere. The course moved quite slowly and nothing we learned was particularly mind-blowing.",
    "First-Order Logic is a serviceable introduction to propositional and quantitative logic that could be so much more. The class draws a lot of students who are looking to fulfill the QR requirement, and while Professor Whittle does an excellent job explaining concepts in a clear and concise manner, his lectures lack the passion or verve that might inspire students to pursue the subject further. Sometimes it felt like the formal systems with which we were dealing were their own little games and that the point of the class was to learn the rules and master the game; there was very little effort to convey the importance or relevance of the material. The organization of the class was also less than ideal; too many lectures in the weeks leading up to breaks were spent in review at the expense of pushing forward into new territory. I feel like we would not have lost much if such review were left to the TAs in section. All that being said, I greatly appreciated how generous Professor Whittle and the TAs were with their time; I only wish their passion for the subject had shone through more often.",
    "A good QR if you do not want to work with numbers. I would not consider it a \"gut\" class but the workload is manageable. It stretched my brain in ways that other classes did not. It is like learning a new language. I felt like I learned a lot by the end of the course.",
    "This course is essentially about the language of and the problems of logic--in a mathematical way. I liked it because it reminded me of geometry--we learned certain rules, and the majority of the course is about applying these rules to complete proofs. Homework is problems from a computer program you have to download, and then send in through an electronic system that automatically grades it for you. This was the one thing that was annoying about this course. I was never sure whether I was getting partial credit, because the TA just receives an email with a list of which problems you completed correctly and which you didn't. The feedback the grading system gives is something like \"Your sixth sentence is an incorrect translation,\" but there are no suggestions given on how to do things correctly. You aren't going to get comments about how to do problems better unless you go directly to the TA or the professor. But overall, it's a good course, great for problem-solving, regular workload (actually the homework is due every Friday so you have the whole week to finish it), and doable for humanities people also. Once you get it, you get it. It's very logical.",
    "I took PHIL 115 as a fifth class, and it served exactly the purpose I was looking for. I have a strong math background, so the QR component of the class was not challenging. The class was not a lot of work at all, and it was pretty interesting. The software used for homework is really fun, too. Overall, a perfect fifth class.",
    "Definitely take it. Especially if you're someone who needs a QR. The complexity takes a jump towards the end of the semester, but there's not a lot of homework, so it won't be a huge time drain.",
    "Take if you're looking for a doable QR, and have some time to put into it.",
    "I took this course to fulfill a QR, and as a humanities major was looking for something not to, well, \"math-y.\" While in the past this course has been reviewed as not too difficult, I definitely did not find this to be the case this year. Part of that was because the second exam (there are two exams and a final) was not only very difficult, but there was far too much material on the test for the 50-minute time period, so that many students ended up with very low grades. That being said, Professor Whittle curved the grades up, but the experience was unnecessarily stressful. While Logic can be sort of fun -- proofs are like puzzles which, if yuo have the patience, can be very rewarding -- the class felt unnecessarily stressful after the second exam. However, the TFs this semester were all great super helpful and supportive which really helped! If you have a mind for abstract quantitative reasoning skills and enjoy puzzles, then perhaps this course is for you; if you're not good at more existential math skills, I'd look elsewhere.",
    "Ah, this course was a very basic introduction to logic, logical sentences, validity, etc. Honestly, if you come from any type of math or science-y background, this course is a breeze. Literally, worked on the psets for 2 hours a week and the midterms and finals were pretty straight forward. However, from talking with other people, it seems that if you don't come from a math\/science-y background, it can be much more challenging.",
    "DecentI suppose a lot of your experience with this class depends on your approach. If you know what you're getting into and if you tap into the problem-solving aspect of it all, then it can be fun. If you took it on a whim like I did, it can be a bit of a grind at times, even if in a tedious-but-not-quite-overwhelming kind of way.",
    "I think Logic is worth taking. It's definitely not a gut (as I think many people think it is), and the homeworks are challenging and interesting. It definitely has it's problems as a course, but I think the problem solving and reasoning skills it teaches are useful and worth practicing. I would definitely suggest working with study groups\/friends as I think it can be hard to tackle a lot of the material going off of lectures\/the text book alone.",
    "People in this class fall into two categories: 1) people who intuitively grasp logic and find it very easy whether or not they take the class or 2) people who don't intuitively grasp logic and will never really get it, even after taking the class. Recommend it for anyone who plans on taking more advanced logic classes after, but not particularly useful as a standalone.",
    "This philosophy course is quite mathy. It doesn't involve numbers or equations, but it has the math logic in the process of finding proofs. I really liked this class, though it was difficult for some people into humanities. It even helped me in the process of writing my arguments in essays.",
    "The material is really interesting, but maybe a different professor would have made it a little bit more accessible.",
    "Good course.",
    "Good if trying to avoid calculus or math",
    "Phil 115 is a challenging but interesting course. FOL is essentially an artificial language used to represent forms of reasoning, and the course is concerned with learning the principles of FOL. Although the content before the first midterm is relatively easy, the course definitely grows in difficulty, so it's important to keep up with the homework. In general, the homework assignments were significantly more challenging than both the in-class work and the examinations, so don't be discouraged if the homework becomes rather puzzling. I would recommend flipping through the textbook before deciding on whether or not to take this class -- it seemed that some people expected the course to be much less \"mathy,\" and the first lecture doesn't really represent what the course will actually be like.",
    "Pretty easy QR. Somewhat like proof-based geometry. If you were good at math in high school (especially geometry), you'll be fine. However, the problem sets can take a while.",
    "I would recommend. I took it as a non-philosophy major looking to round out my schedule with something interesting and not too time-intensive, and I think it was perfect for this. It is somewhat like learning a new language at the beginning, and then the second half is almost entirely proofs. The homework and tests were fair and not too demanding for the most part, although a couple homework exercises became tedious. With a good understanding of material, not hard to get a good grade",
    "It's a good course. It's fun and different and interesting. However it's not super gutty if you've heard that before. It starts slow but gets difficult at the end. Still definitely worth taking.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS - unless you are DESPERATE for a QR credit, or you're actually really good at mathematical thinking and want an easy A. The course was MUCH more difficult this year than it seems it was in the past. The homework was nearly impossible sometimes. The course consists mainly of doing proofs with the very strange language of first-order logic. If you're not great with mathematical thinking, the proofs will be challenging. I struggled with some of the content of the course. The second midterm was VERY HARD and many people ended up getting C's. The final was much easier, but I'm not sure how the final grades will turn out...find an easier QR.",
    "This a really straightforward QR credit. You'll gain some skills in your logical reasoning. If you are looking for a straightforward QR, this is a good class to take.",
    "This is not an easy way to get out of a math course without doing math. I found this class at least as difficult, if not more so, than a regular \"math \" course. However, as a non-math guy, I've never noticed the supposed benefit of increased logical reasoning skills imparted by math courses. This course provided that.",
    "cool(logic)",
    "Interesting course material. Easy QR credit for Humanities people. Lectures not necessary to attend. Interesting pests and good exercise for the brain.",
    "This isn't the most objectionable course I've ever encountered. I didn't really enjoy it, but it provides the coveted QR credit without lasting scars. It taught me to think in different ways, even if the specific ways are not especially applicable outside the class. I didn't like the heavy dependence on software for homework, which I found more difficult to navigate than the concepts themselves. Professor Whittle was nice and interesting enough. Most of this course wasn't especially intuitive to me, so it taught me I apparently am not a very logical person. I don't know what to do with this information.",
    "Study of a formal language of rigorous argumentation that can be applied in proofs. In a larger sense about the science of building arguments and deeming arguments valid or not valid. Touches on issues such as truth, validity, and the relationship between premises and conclusions. Large lecture course that introduces concepts with sections that focuses on practice problems and making sure students can apply the concepts in class to actual proofs and problems. Homework done and submitted through a computer program with three components: tarksi's world (true or false), boole (truth tables), fitch (proofs.) Ultimately come away with a language that may or may not be used in the future, but a greater toolbox to subject arguments in the English language to rigorous scrutiny."
