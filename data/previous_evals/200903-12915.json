    "Math 115 moves really quickly. The professor jumps from topic to topic without much transition and expects us to pick up on answers without much explanation. If you take it, find another professor.",
    "Math 115 is a difficult course with a lot of material. Don't take this course unless you are very comfortable with the material in math 112.",
    "Please don't take this, if you can avoid it. If not, then I'm sorry about your pain. This class is poorly taught and the math department does not need any more encouragement to bring their awkward, impersonable, and condescending grad students to torture an innocent group of pre-meds. The work isn't too bad, but if you did not previously understand calculus, you probably won't here. I heard Steve Orzag was the best, try to take his section.",
    "It's basically a deeper look into Calc BC",
    "It is definitely not an easy class. I took BC calc in high school and got a 5, and it wasn't insanely hard, but definitely wasn't easy. The final was absurdly hard.",
    "Take Roohollah Ebrahimian. He is clear and always there for help. The final is extremely difficult and significantly more complicated than any problem ever completed in the class. It was awful."
