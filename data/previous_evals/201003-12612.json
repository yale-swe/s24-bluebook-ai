   "comments": [
    "It is a very frustrating, work-heavy class. Only take it if you have to.",
    "This class is necessary for the major and helps explain what exactly chemical engineers and environmental engineers do but the material was poorly taught and there was a lot of work. The video project for the class was fun but took up way too much time and effort outside of class time, and was assigned on top of problem sets for the class.",
    "If you have to take this class, I am sorry. Hopefully, Yale SEAS can get rid of this class somehow and save everyone a lot of time.",
    "If you're considering chemical and environmental engineering, this class will help give you a sense of the opportunities available in that direction. So it's great for helping you decide. If you're not considering that direction, I think your time and energy would most definitely be better spent in another class.",
    "Take this class if you have to. Get a good problem set group together and you'll be fine, but don't expect to learn much.",
    "broad intro to different aspects of chemE plus a video project.",
    "This class has received poor reviews in the past and is probably going to receive similarly poor reviews for this term; unfortunately, chemE and envE majors have to take it. The material is not challenging or intimidating at all and the quantitative thinking skills in engineering are stressed throughout. However, the material does get dry, tedious, and not-worth-the-effort at times. Professor Taylor is a very kind professor and the subject is hard to teach. The exams can be difficult at times. The term project is annoying, tedious, and rather unnecessary, but he will most likely continue it as long as he teaches it - just get through it the best you can. Don't let the class dissuade you from chemical engineering or environmental engineering; it gets better from here. Stick with it for the semester and you'll be fine.",
    "Don't take this unless you have to. It might seem like an interesting course, but while the material is definitely useful, it's terribly taught and tough to get anything out of. The term project was very high school (make a video about chemical engineering), and while it was cool to have a final product, I learned nothing from itand it took a ton of time and effort. The final was miserable and impossible and made me realize just how little I had gotten out of this class. Dr. Taylor is a really nice guy, but that doesn't exactly you learn the material. Neither do his powerpoints.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's not very difficult, but can often be very boring.",
    "Gives you a good idea what chemical engineers do which may not be too clear before taking the class. If you're on the ChemE track, you're supposed to take this as a sophomore, but if you take it as a junior there's a lot of overlap with other classes, like PChem or Fluids. Problem sets are a lot harder than the tests in general.",
    "I recommend this class for people in the major or interested in the major. However it represents a significant course load and the video project can easily consume huge parts of your semester without getting very much out of it. The best thing I got out of taking this course was getting to know the people in my class",
    "If you're taking this class, most likely you are a potential chemical or environmental engineering major. If you have a decent background in chemistry, you probably won't have too much trouble with class, since the math in the class is mostly just algebra and applying chemistry principles to material processes. Some projects in the class such as the video project can be time consuming, but partly helpful as well.",
    "It's useful material. If you don't have to take it for your major, but you could take it as an elective, I'd say go for it -- but make sure you have the time to put in to the problem sets. They are solvable, for sure, but they just take a lot of time to get right."
