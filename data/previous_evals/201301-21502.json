    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This course provides an introduction to network analysis in the social sciences and covers a broad range of topics, sometimes at the expense of depth in any one topic. The course is project-based, which keeps all assignments interesting and relevant (but you must have access to anetwork dataset). As a survey the course works relative well, but to walk away with skills that can be applied to research, you must be prepared to take initiative and focus your efforts on the topics that interest you in detail on your own.",
    "This was a good class! I learned a lot from the class project. However, I do think that covering both theory and technique is too much for one class. It would be optimal if in the fall there is a theory class, and then in the spring, a technical course. Otherwise, look forward to more!",
    "Good intro to social network analysis. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Sure. It's very good chance to get some information on social networks.",
    "I would summarize the course as being a rewarding experience, but only if you are willing to work. I would certainly recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "I learned a new method that I will use for current\/future research projects.",
    "Through the project I worked on in this course, I reviewed much of the literature on network-related aspects of my area of research and found that there are large gaps in the literature. I walked away with the ability to critically evaluate network-related research in my field. This course also made it much more likely that I will incorporate network analysis into my dissertation research and ultimately my academic career.",

It would be optimal if in the fall there is a theory class, and then in the spring, a technical course. Otherwise, look forward to more! This class helped me gain a decent fluency with R.",
    "The course was really helpful in understanding the networks literature and how to potentially make a contribution to this literature.",
    "This course showed me an area of the discipline to which I had previously had only limited exposure. Although I'm not sure I will continue working in the area in the future, I feel I now understand a large area of work that I did notbefore I started the course."
