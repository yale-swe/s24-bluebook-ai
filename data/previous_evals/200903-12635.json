    "Yeah I will. Because I learned a lot from it.",
    "If youre interested in the material and willing to put up with Gerardi's crap, this is a gem because of the miniscule amount of work. If you actually want to learn from an active professor or have a legitimate discussion in class, not for you.",
    "Yes, pretty easy seminar, ideal for senior year.",
    "While it wasn't a bad class, I would be cautious as to whether or not I recommend it. There weren't many readings, no paper, and just 2 presentations and weekly responses. Overall, pretty easy semester. But there is a lot of excess fluff in the reading list that is never discussed at any length. Time is spent entirely on presentations even though some of the material can be rather difficult or convoluted. You should not expect to get any feedback on your work (responses or presentations), so your potential to improve throughout the class is...hindered in a sense.",
    "If you are interested in politics and like game theory, it is not a bad course and the workload is minimal. In that respect, I would recommend it. The actual seminars can be a bit tedious, though, so if you are expecting more of a discussion based course, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
