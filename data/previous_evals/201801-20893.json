    "strength is that it focuses on only basic math skills",
    "I think it's pretty strong actually. Not my subject of choice, but it gets the point across.",
    "very systematic, very well-delivered",
    "Strengths are that It was very comprehensive, weaknesses are that it could have been more applied",
    "Strength: covers many important topics Weakness: too much memorization and not much emphasis on problem solving skills",
    "A strength is that the course focuses on techniques to solve general classes of problem, thereby giving us a toolbox of approaches. However, the course is rather proof-driven for an engineering course - it would benefit from more application of the math we were learning.",
    "It is what it is",
    "The class is well-organized and most of the topics is potentially useful for our research. It would be better to add more cases where these analysis method s are used in actually research or applications."
