   "question_id": "AC350",
   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "No, there is no good mylar printer.Often student would use printers that they weren't supposed to use. We need to have a (or preferrably 2) dedicated mylar printer(s), that prints in black, white and red, at good quality.",
    "The studio resources that are available were more than enough to complete the drawings for the course. It could only improve pedagogical relations if small group time with Eisenman were increased. Throughout the semester my group only met with him once and due to the sheer volume of the course this was really the only time to actually interact with the instructor. I realize Eisenman is an historic figure and leader in our discipline but the current dissemination of his ideas through a large lecture is not ideal.",
    "Easy to access image and reading",
    "Disappointed that manual feed printers were frequently offline.",
    "The given image resources were very useful, as were many of the readings, especially towards the end of the semester.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, they were adequate.",
    "Yes",
    "I felt that our resources were adequate. That being said, I heard a rumor about having a mylar printer for next year - I think that would really help out the new class.",
    "The supplied readings and images were extremely appreciated and enriching to the class.",
    "adequate",
    "Yes.",
    "The resources were adequate.",
    "Everything great.",
    "yes",
    "There were not enough printers to print on mylar, for the following reasons:The manual feed plotters were often broken, and in any case, could not load the mylar most times.The small manual feed printers are crappy. When printing on mylar, the ink from these printers bleeds terribly. Not good for mylar at all.",
    "The manual feed printers are NOT meant for mylar.",
    "The inkjet printers provided to print on the required mylar do not work with the mylar sold in the local art supply store. It would be helpful if the DM Office could sell the specific type of mylar required for the machine (much like the woodshop sells supplies).",
    "yes.except one thing.Yale School of Architecture desperately needs a manual feed laser printer if possible, or a printer designated for only mylar prints (not only for this class, but for studio printing too). Its hard to believe that my little ole public school undergraduate had one, but Yale does not.",
    "There is a definite need for better printers when it comes to printing on mylar. The previous years benefited from printers that were more appropriate to the drawings done in this course, which have since disappeared and not been replaced in regards to this course's requirements.",
    "Since all the drawings were on mylar, it might be nice to have a designated, tried and tested printer for mylar on the sixth floor that isn't as finicky as the ones currently at our disposal. Likewise for the mylar itself: there are a number of different finishes and only some are appropriate for ink-jet printing, none of which were stocked by Hull's and as a result printing was always more of a hassle than it could have been.Also (and unrelated), I thought the smaller, rotating, group pin-ups were generally more successful than those done with the entire class assembled together.",
    "The manual feed and inkjet printers were incapable of printing to the brand of mylar sold at Hull\u0092s. Either the TAs should coordinate a class-wide purchase of the appropriate mylar, or a new printing solution should be found. This was one of the consistently (and needlessly) frustrating elements of the class.",
    "Yes, the image resources in the Classes folder were extremely helpful.",
    "If there could be a larger amount of drafting boards\/maylines available, it would be much obliged. I found that a week into the semester, I was unable to locate a free one to use for the required hand-drafting of the first two weeks' work. But then, mother is the necessity of invention, now isn't it?",
    "",
    "Everything was sufficient, although printing mylar on the inkjets (which tended to bleed) was frustrating."
