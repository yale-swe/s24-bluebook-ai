    "The material in this course is absolutely crucial to a full understanding of American history. I would highly recommend it to all students interested in immigration, racial formation, citizenship, and U.S. empire - not just to students whose own work is in the field of Asian American studies.",
    "This course is more than a capable introduction to Asian American history. It will challenge you to think about Asian American history critically, through the juxtaposition of new works with old classics. In this way, students were forced to evaluate the pros and cons of recent theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches that contest conventional paradigms, and whether such works were successful in breaking new ground in the development of the field. I would recommend this course to any student interested in American history, Asian American history, Asian American studies, and\/or race and ethnic studies."

   "comments": [
    "It vastly enhanced my understanding of the origins and development of the field of Asian American history, both in and of itself, as well as in relation to \"mainstream\" American history. It also provided an opportunity to study the background of the Japanese American exclusion movement in the wider context of Asian American history, which is a topic directly related to my dissertation research. The several weeks spent on recent works that employ a transnational perspective were particularly exciting and helpful for my research interests."
