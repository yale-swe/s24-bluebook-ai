   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with limited understanding of how campaigning, mobilization, and issue manipulation, take place in the public sphere.",
    "Great poli sci seminar even for non majors. The assignments are a lot of fun and provide practical experience in putting persuasion to work.",
    "The course looks at political activity ranging from campaigning to manipulation within institutions and between politicians. I recommend the course if you have an interest in questions like what sort of activity actually takes place in Congress, whether voters are actually informed participants in democracy, and how information is disseminated in political atmospheres. I really did like it.",
    "Great class, but I took it when it was small (8 people). Good topic and varies readings. Projects are creative which was fun",
    "Persuasion and Political Communication is a great class that provides insight into the role of information and influence throughout the US political system. The workload is pretty light, the paper assignments are fun (you actually apply the reading you do to campaign memos\/inaugural addresses\/party platforms), and Prof. Henderson is a great teacher who runs a seminar with a good dose of student-led discussion. It's an enjoyable, pretty easy PLSC class, and I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in US politics, voter manipulation, campaign strategy, or partisan rhetoric.",
    "If you're interested in political campaigns, politicians and persuasion, and the psyche of voters, I would definitely recommend this course. The class is a lot of fun! There is a lot to read each week, but the readings are all terrific. There are classic political science readings like Fenno's Home Style and Zaller's The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion. Class is discussion-based, so the quality of each class depends on the strength of you and your classmates' discussions. Prof. Henderson leads a thought-provoking seminar. And one of the best elements of the course is the assignments. Unlike straightforward essays, these are all creative and fun. Using the readings and our discussion you write an inaugural address, study an example of heresthetic, create your own party platform, write your campaign memo or press release, and create your own campaign advertisement or petition. The seminar is very discussion-based so come prepared!"
