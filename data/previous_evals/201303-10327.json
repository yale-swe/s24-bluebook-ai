    "This is a course that will redefine your understanding of leadership and what it means to understand a subject, especially a practical art.",
    "Great class overall, assignments are not an insane amount of work, and Professor Hill is one of the best Professors at Yale. If you get a chance to take this class you definitely should. Having a chance to learn from this man will be invaluable, regardless of what you aspire to achieve in life",
    "If the course were restructured and finessed, I would recommend it to a fellow student. Given that my class was the first to experiment with the course, it's hard to judge the class based on structure in terms of recommending it to a fellow student. Substance-wise, it was pretty remarkable. I think Professor Hill is onto something in his approach of looking at the physical truth of practical skills and deriving higher ideas about statecraft therefrom (as opposed to taking big philosophical ideas and placing them on physical reality), but the analysis and discussion of such things is really difficult -- especially in an elite Ivy setting. The students are limited in their physical knowledge of these practical skills, so the theorizing and analysis surrounding discussion can be oxymoronic to the themes of the course. All in all, this is one of those weird, mind-blowing courses that will probably stay with me for a very long time. In years to come, I imagine that I will still be contemplating the material we read and ideas we discussed. If you really like to take classes whose benefit and worth is immediately recognizable and usable, this is not the class for you. If you are into taking classes that challenge you in weird ways and make you reconsider human interactions with the world and their meaning, then take this course. As a final note, the class attracted some people who were more into hearing themselves talk than actually learning from one another, and that's a shame. I wish there were some way to get the less talkative students to speak up, but I'm sure a lot of them felt intimated by the smarty pants. So shop the class and see if you vibe with the other students in the seminar -- if not, discussion is going to be a real pain.",
    "It's a class like none other I've ever taken before, or anyone esle in the class, for that matter. It attempts to do something very interesting - to draw from the physical, practical arts principles that are metaphysical. It drew from books people have written but also our own life experiences. It was from beginning to end not a memorizaing class, or a how-much-have-you-already-read-about-this class, but \"a thinking class\". Which I loved. The results were probably different for different people, depending on how successful one can truly translate the abstract back into the concrete after coming up with the abstraction... but definitely eye-opening.",
    "yes definitely"
