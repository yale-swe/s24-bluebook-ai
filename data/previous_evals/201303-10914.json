    "As a senior, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I've learned a lot about New Haven through the projects I've done for the class and have a much better understanding of how cities function. After taking the class I always catch myself thinking about the cultural landscape of cities and how the structure of the built environment affects people's actions.",
    "This course is an examination of the \"feeling\" of the city - the culture, the history, the everyday interactions that make a city what it is. If you're interested in the ideas of community action or social construction in urban places, this is the course for you. If you're interested in the hard infrastructure of a city this course could also be a great course for you, as it makes its students aware of the humanity of an often cold and calculated urban environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. It's very unconventional and makes you really look deeper into your surroundings.",
    "It is more of a discussion group than a class.",
    "Urban Life and Landscape is a seminar introduction to Urban Studies. The course covers diverse methodologies and has interesting projects. I recommended to all students interested in architecture and urban history\/development.",
    "Yes, take it. A laid back class with enjoyable readings.",
    "I think this is a good course for both architecture and humanities students in its ability to synthesize and engage both disciplines.",
    "If you're interested in urban studies take it. If you haven't taken a class with Elihu, take it.",
    "A great seminar in which we covered numerous aspects of the city and human life within it. Fun, engaging assignments with a final paper, and the weekly discussions were interesting, too."
