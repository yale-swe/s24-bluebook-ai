    "Good overview of the development of Western medicine.",
    "This course was excellent in providing historical context for my previously piece-meal understanding of medical history. Professor Healey was engaging in lectures, which were extremely well-organized, and I learned a substantial amount of medical history in this class.",
    "Such a great overview of the history of medicine. It helped me realize the reason behind certain viewpoints.",
    "More about how medical concepts have evolved throughout the ages, and its interaction with politics and religion. We talked a lot about the different division of medical labor over the ages.",
    "Development and history of scientific thought in the context of medicine, defining modern medicine",
    "I learned about the history of medicine from ancient greece until the 21st century. we learned primary research methods.",
    "An overview of the history of \"modern\" medicine since Hippocrates, skills analyzing primary sources from a lot of different time periods (from antiquity to the 20th century)",
    "Making Medicine Modern taught me how to re-think conceptual ideas about modernity and medicine. It provided me with primary sources and secondary sources, which helped me practice source analysis and forming evidence-based arguments\/thoughts. I thought the course was rather thought-provoking and it made me think more deeply about how titles like modernity inherently set-up something else as being un-modern.",
    "I was able to gain a better understanding of the history of medicine and the process it took for it to reach where it is today."

   "comments": [
    "This class was for the most part all strengths. Professor Healey was engaging in lecture, and the readings were thought-provoking and relevant. The midterm was fair and Katie (my TF) was also super nice. I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
    "The lectures were well-organized and the readings were interesting and relevant. Healy is an engaging lecturer and she makes the material accessible.",
    "- topic is super fascinating and the readings are cool - lectures just seemed a little jam packed. Need to take out some material if possible",
    "I wish there was more feedback during the semester, but the lectures were great.",
    "This is a really, really, really good class! Jenna prepares slides for every lecture, which really helps me to be more engaged in the class and get a clearer picture of the topics covered. The readings are also very relevant to the class. Overall, it's a great class!",
    "Chronological!",
    "I thought it was a great survey course. at times the amount of material was overhwhelming.",
    "I thought this was a great course, as someone who hasn't taken and might not get the chance to take any other courses from the HSHM department. It was well-designed in that it went through a lot of the major time periods and theories of medicine, having a wide breadth of material, but because of our analysis of primary sources in section, it also didn't feel like a too-broad survey where we didn't get any depth.",
    "I thought the class was very strong overall. The lectures and the discussion sections were informative and engaging. The sources chosen for discussion section were interesting and generally easy to read. My only criticism would be that sometimes the lectures were super-fast paced, which seemed to be due to lack of time and an abundance of material. Although all of the information was great, maybe it would be better to cut it down a bit more, so that other things can be discussed in greater depth.",
    "This course provides a really nice overview of big event in the history of medicine. I found Professor Healey to be a fantastic lecturer who made lecture really engaging! I do think that lecture could be a bit more interactive at times though.",
    "Lecture helped prepare me better for exams rather than section, which we were told would be the opposite. Having more of a summary of the week before section started could've helped tie all of the information together.",
    "The strength of the class was that it was very informative and because the reading were ancient texts, they really made you think about their significance and meaning to the history of medicine. One weakness was that the course and powerpoints were taught and shown at a fast pace and made it hard to take notes."

   "comments": [
    "If you like medicine this course offers an interesting intellectual approach.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this course if you are interested in the history of medicine. you will learn a lot in lecture and by doing the readings\/going to section. Professor Healey is awesome.",
    "Interesting content, not too much work, Katie was not a great tf",
    "Light workload and a really expansive, interesting topic.",
    "Highly recommend! Very fun, very interesting. Jenna Healey is a great lecturer.",
    "It's a great way to understand medicine!",
    "Take this class if you have the opportunity to! (but maybe not anymore)",
    "Definitely would recommend especially as an HSHM major!! Fascinating content and good professor!",
    "Every HSHM major should take this. Otherwise you'll have a melange of knowledge without any narrative to punch it into.",
    "Would definitely recommend! If you have any interest in medicine or medical history, the material is really interesting. Professor Healey does a great job presenting information in a way that is balanced and nuanced, not depicting every invention or discovery in medicine as a miracle breakthrough but showing who actually benefitted and what actually changed. The workload is reasonable and the primary source readings very interesting.",
    "I would completely recommend this course to another student. Making Medicine Modern (M3 as I would sometimes call it) is a great course that spans from antiquity to modern day. Although it is a lot of material, Professor Healey did a fantastic job at weaving together this story of developing \"modern\" medicine. The material is similar to other HSHM classes, but the thematic focuses are different. The focus on modernity and challenging what that means sets the class apart from other HSHM classes. I thought the class was enlightening, so definitely take it if you are a fan of HSHM, history, or medicine. It really can appeal to everyone though.",
    "If you would like to understand why our medical system looks the way it does, and how we got here I most definitely would recommend this class! I learned so much!"
