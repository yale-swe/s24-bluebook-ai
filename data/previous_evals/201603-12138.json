   "comments": [
    "This class gave me a broader and more profound understanding of African American history since 1865. It allowed me to develop my writing skills all while becoming a more confident thinker. Also a great class for thinking about research and the profession at large.",
    "This course provides a systematic introduction to African-American historiography. Most importantly, as a result of this course I have begun to think about the content and direction of my dissertation prospectus in fresh ways.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding about shifting historical perspectives and the importance of viewing history through multiple lenses. The assignments (an interpretive essay and syllabus) were incredibly useful in pushing me to think about what I had read and discussed in class in a comprehensive way. I gained insight into how to write more clearly and directly and I also gained importance practice in asking vital questions about the subjects I am studying. I also gained public speaking skills and having to discuss the texts in class and speak to my interpretations about them in such detail was an invaluable experience.",
    "This course has been one of the most influential in shaping the way that I understand late 19th through 21st century history."

   "comments": [
    "This class was incredibly strong because it encouraged student engagement. We built a sense of community in the classroom which made us all better at the end of the day. I've never learned so much in such a brief period of time.",
    "This course is excellent on all counts.",
    "This course was incredibly helpful in pushing me to narrow my research interests. I also gained incredibly valuable knowledge about African American history and with Professor Gilmore's guidance began to think more deeply about what questions were important to think about while doing my work. Professor Gilmore was an incredible facilitator and our discussions during the semester situated the readings in the broader historical context. I appreciated all of the assignments and the weekly postings were very useful in helping me synthesize the material. I also really appreciated Professor Gilmore's guidance concerning graduate school outside of the course, especially our mock orals session. I feel much more prepared for graduate school after taking this course.",
    "The class was wonderful."

    "Absolutely. Unfortunately, this is Glenda's last year teaching, but if she was still teaching, this would be my number on recommendation to other graduate students.",
    "Absolutely. In my view, every graduate student researching the United States -- its history, culture, politics -- needs to take this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It greatly expanded my knowledge of African American history and strengthened my reading, writing, and discussion skills."
