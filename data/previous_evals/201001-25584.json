   "comments": [
    "151 is a good way to start learning advanced French. Personally I preferred the films and texts from 150 so if you will only take one of these classes then I suggest the other one. Mme Charney is a good teacher and very passionate about her students.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take it! French is fascinating and wonderful. A nice break from the other more boring courses.",
    "This class has a pretty relaxed atmosphere, and the movies and readings aren't painful. It's a good class for keeping your French up, and Madame Charney is a breath of fresh air.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who wants to further their French skills. It's challenging, but not overly so, and you get a lot of practice with usage and building vocabulary.",
    "I would recommend this class absolutely! It helped my writing, command in speaking, range of vocabulary and reading comprehension. Mme Charney was great, though her teaching style wasn't everyone's favorite. Also, if you're coming out of this class from L4, know that the readings are less depressing and the movies much more enjoyable.",
    "Take French 151 if you want to improve your writing and grammar. The class was not that interesting."
