   "comments": [
    "ECON 110 is an introductory economics class. Personally, I found the subject pretty dry, but the seminar class was fine! If you are interested more in behaviors in economics than strictly mathematical stuff, you should definitely take the seminar (110) over the lecture. I had had no previous exposure to econ at all and I found the course very manageable. It's important to do all the reading in the book. I personally found it most successful to do the reading and then see it solidified when taught in seminar. Don't be confused by the name \"seminar\" though; the class really is just a small lecture. An advantage of the size is being able to ask questions, but it is definitely not a \"seminar\" in the discussion sense.",
    "A good class and a good way to start off econ. Would recommend this class over the lecture because you get more attention and help.",
    "Would recommend for prospective econ majors. Small class, great for note-taking because Tolga writes down everything on the blackboard. You learn a lot faster by going to class than reading the unnecessarily detailed book yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class to another freshman asopposed to the seminar. It is slightly more rigorous, but you learn more, and I thought it wasn't very hard on the whole. It's just six easy problem sets (you get to drop your lowest), midterm, and final. Basically what ends up happening is everyone gets 100s on the psets, so your grade comes from just two tests, so make sure you're prepared for them. But they were pretty straightforward, and even though the test is curved tougher than most Yale courses it really wasn't much work. It will prepare you for future study in econ and is worth taking overall. Tolga and Katerina are both good teachers; Katerina probably teaches her kids a little more about econ, but Tolga is really chill and jokes around a ton and makes the class enjoyable, so you really can't go wrong with either professor.",
    "Yes, I would. They'll enjoy Tolga as a teacher and walk away with a good understanding of economic concepts. They should be aware, however, that the curve is stricter than for Econ 115.",
    "I think I would recommend Econ 110 (the seminar) over Econ 115 (the large lecture class). I had Tolga, and he was really fun. You should definitely actually try to keep up with the readings, though, and make sure you go to his office hours--especially when a problem set is due! I think the seminar actually has less work than the lecture. Tolga makes an effort to get to know his students a little, which is really nice. Also, I would totally recommend microeconomics in general! I thought it would be kind of boring and not applicable to life, but many of the principles and concepts you learn in this class are valuable in everyday life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, assuming that student is interested in a slightly more in-depth economic study and genuinely wants to learn economics. The curve is tight, so if anyone wants to take this as an \"easy\" class, I would tell them to steer clear of the course. With that being said, though, it is very possible to be successful in the class academically.",
    "A very good introduction to the course, it ain't too rigorous. I had Tolga, and he was awesome!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, if only just to get an idea of what economics is all about. The only problem with the class is the harsh grade curve as compared to Econ 115.",
    "This class is necessary for almost all majors at Yale. I would definitely look more into the seminar vs. the lecture because the lecture with smaller sections might actually be better (since the \"seminar\" is 40-50 people in a class with no smaller section). There is also a huge difference in the amount of reading.Of the two professors I would take it with Tolga (although both have their flaws) because he leads the review sessions and always says that he is not familiar with how the other professor grades, which make it almost impossible to rely on his review answers (if you have the other professor).",
    "The pace of this course was very fast, and you should definitely have taken some kind of economic class in high school (otherwise take the lecture). The class size is small which makes it easy to ask any questions when they come up. Tolga is a great teacher and is very adept at providing real-world examples of concepts. He also cracks a lot of jokes to relieve the tension. Try to keep up and attend classes because if not you'll have to cram hard for the tests. Also don't be afraid to ask him to repeat something or clarify something he wrote on the board, because his accent and handwriting can be hard to decipher.",
    "Professor Koker is extremely knowledgable and is very much available. He holds office hours regularly and is more than willing to meet with students outside of office hours and class. He tends to use many anecdotes and stories throughout class. Sometimes, this is helpful, because it helps clarify a concept or creates a needed pause through some of the dense material. Sometimes it's not too helpful, because some of the stories are irrelevant and we don't cover all of the material and fall behind. This doesn't mean that you don't learn; it just means you may have to rely on the textbook more and come into office hours more frequently. I would recommend this class to students. The seminar was a conducive environment for learning economics and provided students with a mechanism to be more engaged with the material.",
    "Definitely a good introduction to microeconomics, which I think everyone should learn. But a lot of people in the seminar had taken econ in high school, which made it tougher for those who hadn't. If you've never taken econ before, I'd recommend taking the lecture instead, because the curve is easier.",
    "Econ 110 is a solid intro to microeconomics, and is decently quantitative. It won't inspire you like Intro to Psych or CogSci might, but still covers some important concepts for everyday life or for further study of econ.Some specifics on placement: In terms of learning, I would not say I felt I was getting that much stronger of an understanding of economics compared to my friends in the lecture (Econ 115). Perhaps 110 is a little more quantitative and does a little more behavioral economics, but I believe there are also some things that 115 does that 110 does not (though I may be wrong). The biggest difference is the student composition: 110 is mostly highly motivated students so you'll more likely work hard to master the material or else the curve will hurt you. In 115 it'll be much easier to coast on a cursory understanding and still get a good grade because of all the athletes and relatively less motivated peers.For someone strong at math (especially if you took multivariable in high school), I'd also give some thought to going right into intermediate micro (121 or 125) even if you haven't done econ before. They cover much the same material but just more deeply. The idea is having intro econ gives one a more gradual ramp to learning the more difficult quantitative concepts, but if you're good at math you probably don't need that.",
    "Challenging course, but definitely take it! Go to office hours.",
    "if you want to be an econ major or have taken AP or IB econ in high school, i would recommend this course.if you have never taken an econ course and are wanting to learn the basics, do not enroll in this course. It moves at a very fast pace.",
    "Take the seminar if you want to actually learn economics. Take the lecture if you want a higher grade.",
    "I would summarize the course as a fast-paced introduction to Microeconomics that nearly serves as an in-depth intermediate course as well. A lot of work needs to be put into learning the concepts for the midterms, but the amount of knowledge one gains is rewarding.",
    "Seminar version of the lecture - you get more interaction, but the grading is tougher. Would recommend if you want to really get close with your professor, but not if you really really want an A.",
    "I recommend the class for any student who is considering an Intro Econ course. I thought that the seminar was far more compelling and interesting than the lecture, as I heard from my friends who took 115. Tolga is a great professor.",
    "I would say this course teaches students how to think rationally and make good decisions. It also teaches students to understand the way that consumer, firms, and producers make decisions. It teaches students how the business world works and how to maximize utility regardless of the situation. I would recommend this class to anyone as it teaches students how to think and make rational decisions.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. Tolga is a great instructor."
