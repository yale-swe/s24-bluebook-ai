    "Take it! Very mathematical",
    "Take it. If you've taken GR before, take this again -- there will certainly be important things that you've missed. If you've never taken it before, you're in for a treat. The reason is that he is very good at explaining abstract things in terms that students can understand. For example, talking about atlases\/maps at the beginning helped make things very concrete.",
    "Definitely recommend! Really cool material, including gravitational waves to black holes. Prof. Moncrief was a great instructor in this class -- I think he's underrated as a professor. He has a knack for explaining really complicated stuff in a waythat helps you gain intuition without obscuring the technical details. He was always available outside of class and was super helpful if you came to him with questions. I found the textbook (Wald) to be pretty dense, so I spent some time with Sean Carroll's GR lecture notes on arXiv. The exams were tricky, but they were take-home, and so that gives you a chance to really bang your head against them. Which means you end up learning things. One feature of the class this semester was that there were a lot more undergrads than grads, but I'm not sure if that affected the pace of the class compared to a more grad-heavy class.",
    "Will definitely recommend."
