    "Awful class. Don't put yourself through it.",
    "If you took physics in high school, you will sleep through this class and you'll get an A. If you didn't take physics in high school, you'll still sleep through this class \u0097 and have a really hard time on the midterm and final.If you're just looking for a Sc\/QR, there HAS to be something more interesting than this.",
    "This is a very elementary high school physics course. The problem sets are not too difficult but the math on the test can be a bit tricky. It is kind of similar to planets and the stars\/galaxies and the universe in that respect. If you need a science credit but don't mind math I would suggest this class.",
    "It was a fair and good course where you learn the basics of all types of physics, mechanics, electricity, magnetism, relativity, quantum mechanics etc..Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Good for a science credit and not too tough if you already have a background in high school physics",
    "No. Don't take this. Its not easy and there is a lot of unnecessary work.",
    "Sure, if you want to really know the basics.",
    "This is wayyyy more work than it is worth. If Stephen Irons is teaching it again, I would avoid it if you are looking for an easy science credit. There are daily pre-quizzes that take an unnecessary amount of time.",
    "Only if you are good at math and have taken high school physics.",
    "yes - steady workload, not very difficult, clear grading system",
    "This class doesn't spend as much time as I would have thought on modern physics, but rather rehashes basic physics concepts (including electricity and magnetism so beware.",
    "Overall this course sought to cater to non-science majors and while it was by no means and enjoyable experience, it was alright. The weaknesses of the course were that I felt that the material itself easily became dull since it was a shallow survey course for non-majors, many of which did not seem remotely interested in being in class and made for a rather dreary classroom environment. Additionally, it was not fun to have to trek up science hill, though one was forced to since attendance was measured by clickers.However, I think that the professor really did the best he could to be both entertaining (with in-class demonstrations) and helpful (with website material, answering questions, and review sessions) given the circumstances. Take it if you need a science credit."
