   "comments": [
    "Theory is poorly taught in lecture, practical application is taught in lab which is slightly better. Recommendation: If teaching could be improved the same amount of theory could be covered and the practical application could be more emphasized in lecture.",
    "The class has a very wide audience, and it is apparent to me as a student how difficult it is to teach biostatistics and non-biostatistics students simultaneously. However, as a biostatistics student, I would not call the class \"easy\"; though I think the course would benefit from having more mathematical\/theoretical derivations, overall, I believe the class would benefit from being more clear in general. I think the concepts are explained very thoroughly, but the mathematics and theory seems to be brushed aside, and perhaps more time and clarification spent on the mathematics\/theory of the model equations would be helpful (e.g. knowing where the equations and terms in the equations come from, and having them very clearly and explicitly defined, might be helpful for everyone in the room).",
    "The course is hard to follow. The instructor seems to know lot about longitudinal data analysis but she cannot communicate with students effectively.",
    "This course is a very useful course and teaches the longitudinal analysis. It's the required course for Biostatistics students and some students from other public health department will also take the course, but most students are Biostatistics students. The professor keeps asking if students not form Biostatistics can understand the class, and no one is willing to talk. The class has 20 minutes overlapping with another required course for Biostatistics students. All the students have to come late and it is very annoying because the professor literally starts the class 20 minutes late and cuts the whole class to 1 hour instead of 1 hour 20 minutes. The classroom of this class is a huge lecture hall without blackboard, which seriously and materially impairs learning experience. Under these extreme hostile learning circumstances, the professor still refuses to change the classroom and the time of the class. The professor also refuses to use other tools that project the handwriting into screen claiming that there is not enough time for writing formula. If more time is distributed to actual teaching instead of waiting for other students and asking if anyone can understand the class, I think it will be enough time to derive some formula. This class is difficult in terms of the underlying mathematics, the lab materials, the software implementations. But this class is not detail driven and only provides a vague and fuzzy description of knowledge. It is literally the worst class I took at Yale.",
    "A better text book is needed More class time may needed every week",
    "The teacher cannot explain things clear. She is a good person but not helpful at all. I cannot learn anything from this class.",
    "Course was good, particularly useful for technical aspects of re: assessing repeat measures and longitudinal model building. A bit overwhelming as a non-biostatistics student. Having the theory and software code in one presentation was sometimes helpful but not always clear. Midterm format a bit different; perhaps a mock exam or a quiz prior to midterm might help with preparation.",
    "This course was very hard at first. You need to spend much time on it yourself and at last you could make it through.",
    "I would have liked more of an emphasis on multilevel modelling, other than longitudinal."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Cannot link the simple practical examples given to the theory beyond the basic equations. Is unable to transition from the simple equations to the higher concepts involved in fitting the data i.e. various covariance\/correlation matrices, interclass correlation, etc.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0I think she needs to improve her communication skills. At the same time, she is not able to convey information effectively.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0It is without doubt that this is a very difficult course but Prof. Lin does not provide good slides and textbooks for us to better understand the topic. In fact, she basically lets us read the slides and textbooks and learn by ourselves instead of providing useful insight into understanding these topics. Prof. Lin is good at explaining basic concepts and making examples. However, she is not good at defining mathematical formulas and explaining the mathematical concepts. It is true that there are also some non-biostatistics students who took this course, but it is not an excuse to not teach the basic mathematical and statistical ideas and concepts. She just glimpses through every important concepts spend the most of time in class asking students if they can understand what she was talking. It is better to explain these concepts instead of spending half of the time asking students whether they can understand it. My suggestion to this course is that the professor should spend more time preparing the course and asking student's questions and concerns. The course slides should be re-prepared. This course should based on careful and rigorous derivation for students to understand the topics. Otherwise all we learn is simply how to write some SAS codes and even don't know what the output means. A classroom with blackboard is necessary. More course hours should be distributed. Instead of meeting once a week for 1 hour 20 minutes, it should be meeting twice a week and each cession should be 1 hour 20 minutes without other interuptions.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a01. It would be better if the instructor can use the blackboard and chalks more often. 2. It would be better if the instructor can explain things more directly instead of giving unrelevant examples. 3. It would be better if we can have a brief introduction every time before a new lesson.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Please revise the PPT and make everything clear. I understand NOTHING and that is definitely because I am not intelligent!",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Eager to engage, understanding of different technical abilities of students. Not always clear but willing to use examples and probe students re: the meaningfulness of concepts.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr.Lin is a good professor in this field of study, obviously she masters the through knowledge. But she is probably not an excellent lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Clear communication with the students would be helpful. More detailed and comprehensive slides would also be helpful."
