   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very diverse and interesting",
    "Way too heavy on the CDE, not enough on the SBS. Also, I realize this is a time for people to learn about research in the field, but for those of us who don't necessarily want to do research, talks from people like Tim Mercer are much more valuable. Please try and focus more on this side of public health in future seminars.",
    "There was a variety of topics discussed, however, i think it may be more interesting to have more outside speakers who aren't necessarily affiliated with Yale.",
    "I enjoyed this semester's topics",
    "The lectures were interesting and informative.",
    "The only thing I did not like about the seminar was that some of the invited speakers were faculty from whom we've heard many times talk about their research. Those topics weren't necessarily new and thus not very interesting and stimulating. I would like to see more faculty from different institutions or from other schools talking about a variety of topics.",
    "I had heard at least one of the speakers in another course (Measurement Issues) so that lecture was a bit repetitive. Also, many of us had already taken the required SBS course with Jeanette Ickovics so hearing her lecture again was incredibly repetitive as her talk was not much different from her class! I preferred lectures from professors who did not teach required first-year courses or professors who did teach required courses but spoke about research they did not tell us about in their classes (eg. Rob Dubrow).",
    "I do not feel that this course contribute substantially to my education at YSPH.",
    "Speakers were Epi driven, I would have appreciated more SBS speakers throughout the year.",
    "The seminars were very interesting.",
    "There was interesting mix of speakers this semester. I really enjoyed having lunch with Jewel Mullen.It would be neat if we could suggest and have other outside speakers brought in. I am not sure if there is funding for this.",
    "The spectrum of topics covered in seminar is very broad. Some were more enjoyable to me than others perhaps due to interest but also mainly due to the nature of the speaker. Some speakers were difficult to understand when they used complex terms beyond what I might have learned before.",
    "strengths: a diversity of speakers; the frequency of seminars this spring semester was far more reasonable than fall semester'slimitations: some instructors were not particularly enthused to be speaking, nor prepared to speak to students who may not be familiar in the subject area. Lunch should be provided.",
    "Great speakers this semester!",
    "I enjoyed the speakers in the seminar. However, I would have liked to hear some speakers from outside of Yale.",
    "lectures were not very interesting and they were mostly presentations we have already seen in other settings.",
    "This class's biggest strength and weakness was that it was a largely a review of Epi 1. This was helpful in reinforcing concepts, providing alternative methods of approaching the same concepts, and taking time to go into certain topics in more detail. On the other hand, some parts were very redundant, especially if the concept had been fully understood in Epi 1.",
    "I thought that most of the topics were interesting and usually enjoyed attending. I think a proper lunch would be nice instead of just cheese and crackers since the seminar is held at noon."

    "Learning more about the opportunities in the public health field is definitely valuable",

    "Good to explore diverse areas of public health.",
    "This course brings in speakers from various topics in CDE\/SBS to discuss their research.",

    "Interesting speakers presenting on their public health research in epi and sbs",
    "I would recommend this seminar course to another student.",
    "Useful to take if concepts from Epi are shaky.",
    "As a required aspect of SBS\/CDE I think the topics are interesting, but there could be more involvement. The students come and listen and are exposed to some research ideas and opportunities, and it was nice to see what the interests are of the faculty in the department."
