   "comments": [
    "David is a very exciting professor. Just watching him talking about a subject he's so passionate about is very engaging. To me personally it was interesting to get to know my classmates from the aural perspective.",
    "The format of the class works really well for the subject, and I feel very privileged to be part of a great class. Not only do I know have an affinity to sound design, I also learned so much about what goes into it, and its not an easy job I must say! By the way, kudos to David Budries.",
    "Overall I enjoyed this class. I have taken a sound design class in the past, but David made me have a better understanding of the \"feeling\" of sound that I really appreciate.",
    "The prompts that were given were very useful to direct students to specific elements needed for sound design. Discussions were also useful but could be more so if a part were to have aural examples and contrasting examples to give students a better idea of what they should be looking for. This was partially brought out during discussion of student inputs but other time some additional example would have been useful.",
    "I think this class has a great balance of listening to and discussing work that students bring in and instruction from David. I think that I have become a better listener and more attuned to the basic principles of sound design.",
    "I appreciated that this class focused on listening and building a vocabulary that we could use to discuss work with sound designers. I felt like I got exactly what I needed out of it.",
    "An appreciation of what goes into recording music and sound through unpacking the sounds we brought into class.",
    "I enjoyed the class, and all the exercises were very helpful to develop an ear for sound. I think all exercises had a clear goal to learn different functions of sound.",
    "For me this class opened up my overall understanding of just how complex sound design, creation of content and even the technical aspects of speaker placement is. It's given me a stronger sense of what sound designers go through on any given production and has increased my awareness of sound design as a whole."

   "comments": [
    "I did not feel there was any logical structure in the course which is why it was hard to follow or remember what happened the week before. I also felt that the class would have a bigger impact on me if there were fewer people in class. In such a large group, by chain reaction or not, people get bored or stop paying attention. I felt while for some people the class is a bit too difficult or irrelevant, for sound designers - the class is too easy.",
    "I think a useful addition could be during the portion of the class when David explains the 'drier' topics of sound. I think at this part of the class, it would be helpful if we could actually hear the differences in 'timbre' etc. There were some examples that David let us hear, but I think there could be even more particularly harder to understand concepts like 'brightness' or 'light'.",
    "Student examples that are generated should be uploaded to some database so that we can all listen to and remember what others did and general comments about what was submitted. Again this will allow more ear training rather than having to remember what was done in class by the other 20 people.",
    "I think the class is great",
    "I wish there would be more exercises related to plays as a way to apply knowledge we learn from the class. I also feel there are many technical terms to learn that I am not sure if I completely understood, and also if they were necessary to learn to understand the main role of sound in a production.",
    "No, I think the class is a very well structured class and David does a great job of breaking down the basics for those who aren't familiar with certain terms or techniques. I think it would've been great to spend some class time in the recording studio and getting from hand experience in what it's like to be behind the microphone as well as sitting behind the console and seeing those recording techniques we discussed in class put into practice."

   "comments": [
    "As a non-sound design students, I felt very tethered to only finding sounds on Itunes or Youtube. I was very interested in using programs to create my own sounds like cue lab, but as a non-mac users, I also do not have access to the programs and gaining entrance to the lab is also difficult on our schedules.",
    "A personal challenge for me was to learn some of the software that others were using. By the end of the semester I had a much better handle on, for example, q-lab than I did at the start.",
    "nope",
    "As a Costume designer, I had difficulty feeling that the content of the class is at all relevant to my own work. I felt that a lot of the concepts were very elementary, especially having been a student of music\/violin for 11 years of my youth. I loved David's energy and passion about the topic, but I can't help but feel like my time would be better spent learning more about costumes.or for that matter, more about digital technology and imaging.",
    "It was difficult initially to find sounds and to figure out ways in which to edit them together as someone who doesn't have a clue where to find good editing software let alone the time to learn how to use it. Once I was able to bend YouTube to my will that made things easier, but I think it would be nice to have a suggested list of free to use, simple editing software in the syllabus for non-sound design students to use if they so desire."

   "question_text": "Do you have any comments about the teaching\/learning environment?",
   "comments": [
    "Since all we do in the class is learn how to understand and hear sound work - the table was an unnecessary barrier. I think the class would be much more impactful if students were just sitting in circle with no table between us.",
    "Though I did not talk very much, I enjoyed the openness and encouragement of class discussion.",
    "The use of handouts was very effective. It would also be good to have a database of example of sounds\/environments to refer to as part of the class.",
    "David is great at making a welcoming space for learning",
    "I liked the format of show\/tell followed by lecture\/listening. It kept me engaged.",
    "The teaching environment was very open and welcoming, however when i did try to contribute to discussion, i would realize that by asking a question, the instructor's intention was not often to promote conversation or discussion, but mainly to act as a vehicle to push forward the lecture. I would have loved if these questions would have led to more discussion, as it would have kept me more engaged as a student. Perhaps I would have felt like the subject was more relevant to me as a visual designer if there was more of a discussion, if my opinion in class mattered. As it was, I realized the point of class was to sit and listen.a good sentiment, but as a result i felt myself disengage.",
    "David is a mad sound\/music genius and approached each class with a clear goal of what he wanted us to get out of that day, and what he wanted us to focus on and learn. While that class room isn't ideal I think it worked just fine for class given the speaker placement in the room."

    "I think the class is a very random mix of people, while some want to know way more than what is being taught, others don't care at all.",
    "Some students did not take the prompts seriously. Discussions sometimes lagged when students did not participate with reactions to what was being played.",
    "Loved this class. Homework was enjoyable, learning environment was encouraging. Exactly what one would hope for in an intro level class."
