    "I reccomend it.You can learn about Latino\/Chicano history and culture, not to mention increase your understanding of yourself\/heritage.",
    "Take it to read a lot of interesting and engaging Latino books. It does not require that much time and is relatively easy as long as you remain on top of the reading. Two papers a presentation (that does not require so much work) and weekly short blogs - the professor is very understanding and sympathetic and smart. A good survey of Latino novels and culture that keeps you engaged at all times and even goes so far as to tackle the unconventional artistic forms of theatre and spoken word. Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's absolutely amazing. The professor, Professor Rasmussen, is phenomenal. She makes the readings interesting and fun. She leadsclass discussions in such a way that everyone feels comfortable to talk. I really felt the class chemistry was the best I have ever experienced at Yale, and I think that's because of Professor Rasmussen's leadership in the classroom. Take this class, it will make your life happy. =)",
    "Take this class! Take it! Take it!",
    "Chicano Lit is a great class where you get to readall kinds of great Latino literature and talk about it in these awesome, interactive, discussions. You learn from Professor Rasmussen's contextual and literary instruction, as well as from the insights of fellow students and their experiences. I would definitely recommend the course!",
    "Intro to Chicano\/Latino Lit is a great course if you have never been introduced to this body of literature. The pace of the course allows for great discussion and more in-depth coverage of each work. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "This is an awesome class!!! Take it, whether you're interested in Chicano studies or not. The material is really interesting, the workload is totally manageable, class discussion was always interesting, and Prof. Rasmussen is great.",
    "Take the class. It's fun. Not that hard in terms of work load. It does get slightly boring at the end.",
    "Take Latino\/Chicano Lit. if you are looking for a class with great reading that you rarely find in other lit. classes that do not focus on ethnic authors or 3rd world feminists. With that said, beware of the misnomer in the title, because even though we do cover some non-Chicano authors, the scope of the class really focuses on Chicano authors.",
    "You get to read good Latino literature books and have great discussions in class about the books.",
    "yes, definitely. i'm not a big reader, but the course seem interesting. great lit that i had no exposure to, and i'm grateful that prof. rasmussen came here to offer the class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!! ABSOLUTELY!! you will NOT regret it. Yale needs more courses like this on latino studies and professor Rasmussen is amazing. No student should graduate from Yale without at least a baseline familiarity with Diaz, Cisneros, etc.",
    "Definitely recommend! These texts are a must-know, even for people who don't typically venture into things \"Latino\" or literature classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that was interested in Latino&Chicano literature. The course offers a nice variety of literature and I think that all the books are enjoyable and not difficult to read. The course is primarily discussion-based so reading the material is important. Papers aren't very long and the group project is really fun."
