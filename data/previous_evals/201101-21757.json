    "Well, if you need to take it for the econ major, obviously do. If you are taking it for the heck of it, take it with Sigga",
    "In the lectures, Alonso greatly summarizes the context of every chapter and reads it verbatim in class which makes the book less necessary. I would definitely recommend this course because students learn the economics that is constantly on the news, the only probably is you have to take micro first.",
    "This is a do-it-yourself type of class, which you should be very good at by the time you've gotten to Yale (and if not, this might be a good time to try it). There's no real value in going to class because the ppt slides you get correspond exactly with what Alonso is saying. Office hours were pointless and unhelpful. However, if I'm not mistaken the curve is more generous than the Lecture equivalent. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the course unless you have some background knowledge or like to teach yourself.",
