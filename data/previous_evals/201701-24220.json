    "The readings for this course were fantastic, but I wish we had spent more time with the 19th century, and even more time with Hoffmann. I found it hard to pin down my audience because not everyone had the same level of musical knowledge. The readings generated complex ideas that my level of German did not allow me to express adequately. Having the course keep the readings in German but make discussion in English might have helped, but then my German would have improved less."

    "This is a fantastic course for anyone interested in German musicology of the 19th centuries. While the readings are quite difficult, don't be scared off by the first ones, I found myself getting better at reading much faster. This class will improve your reading and writing skills, but assumes that you have sufficient speaking skills to get by. The 9:00 start time was difficult, but the more people take this course, the better it can be."
