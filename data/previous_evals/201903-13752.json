    "I learned what green building is, not only its definition, but also its applications. I learned how to work on a building level to improve the overall performance of an architecture, to increase the thermal comfort, and to save energy.",
    "This course provided a valuable and eye-opening introduction to the green building industry and key green building practices.",
    "Learned about everything there is to do with the green building movement--generally speaking, including the actual metrics that define green building as well as the peripheral issues such as rating systems, economics, etc. We also got to learn from practitioners which was a really enlightening perspective.",
    "So much about the science of buildings. I learned how important making our buildings more sustainable is. I learned what are the important things to think about when upgrading a home.",
    "From this course, I gained both a broad understanding of green building design, and knowledge about detailed building issues such as building energy efficiency, building envelope water and vapor protection, and heating\/cooling systems."

   "comments": [
    "I did not expect to learn so many practical skills and knowledge but the course taught me much more.",
    "The scope of material and skills taught in this class exceeded my expectations.",
    "It was a well-rounded survey of issues with green-building, which is exactly what I hoped to get out of it.",
    "Exceeded my expectations.",
    "The class exceeded my expectations. The speakers were excellent, and Paul Yost's lectures and choice of content covered the material well."

  {
   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Because the class is so practical, it brings Architecture from the altar to the ground. It shorten the distance between the discipline and my life. Now I see architecture in a whole new perspective. I feel like I'm learning the bones and skin of architecture in architecture school, whereas I learned its organs and how everything works together in this class. I think some topics in the class could be addressed more. And it could add some theoretical readings about green buildings including the debate and arguments around it.",
    "The field trip to Brattleboro was one of my favorite parts and definitely the most memorable. Speaking and touring with industry leaders there, as well as hearing from them in class, was the class' greatest strength.",
    "Strengths: The classes were very interactive. Professor Yost is great at engaging us with his teachings. The field trip to Vermont was fantastic and it was very nice to be able to see some of the lessons from the class first hand. The final project was really fun to do. I loved that we had the freedom to pick what we wanted to pick for the project. Weakness: Some of course was somewhat disorganized. At one time there were 6 syllabi on Canvas. It was a bit confusing to keep up with what was due when. I did like that Professor Yost was flexible with some of our assignment due dates.",
    "It seemed that a technical background might be useful to follow the detailed discussion of building performance, it is possible that other students are less interested in these details and would benefit more from increased content that relates the study to other typical FES topics such as power and policy. Perhaps there could be two courses on this topic, one that is more technical building science, the other that deals with green design in the broader sense of environmental study work."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings are very helpful and could be beneficial for life time.",
    "This is a great class to get an understanding about where we spend 80% of our lives and what contributes to 40% of the worlds emissions. The final project can be made to something really fun and something that you can really dive into a topic that you are interested in.",
    "Keep up with the weekly readings and assignments, including reading the entire \"How Buildings Work\" book at the beginning of the term. Developing this base knowledge early on allows much greater understanding of the content to follow. Also, take advantage of Peter Yost's office hours to develop assignment topics early in the course; the work load will be much less if you are able to link the topics of all the assignments."
