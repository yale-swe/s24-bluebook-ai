    "Capstone is the highlight of Global Affairs. I thought I took a lot of interesting courses so far, but the Capstone was much more than just a course. Our project worked with a national lab in California to draft a comprehensive policy proposal for additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing. To replicate the national security decision-making process, we took an inter-agency approach, with each student researching and representing the perspective of a particular stakeholder in the process. Examples included government agencies such as the Department of State and the Department of Commerce, as well as private entities such as the National Association of Manufacturers. We visited our client at the beginning of the semester to discuss expectations and goals and eventually also made a trip to DC to meet with relevant officials from various departments. What we learned through our research as well as through such discussions helped guide and enrich our final proposal that was presented to our client. I definitely learned and grew a lot through this course. It wasn't easy. After all, Capstone topics tend to be pretty heavy and the project is a team effort that requires much collaboration. However, I was blessed with a great team and an amazing advisor and I ended up thoroughly enjoying the experience.",
    "Absolutely. Definitely make sure to look at who the advisors are for Capstones though they make such a huge difference, regardless of the topic. Professor Graham is a superstar, and if he's leading another Capstone next year I cannot recommend taking his highly enough. The Capstone project itself was challenging and required a great deal of work, but our amazing professor and great team definitely lessened the burden.",
    "Take whatever capstone Tom Graham is teaching.",
    "Some projects are better than others, unfortunately.",
    "It's the capstone so I assume you have to take it. Well, it's definitely much more enjoyable than a senior research paper, but your mileage will definitely vary with your instructor and topic. Personally I enjoyed my experience. Sign up for a capstone topic with actual real-world significance and hope for the best."
