   "comments": [
    "An introduction to the fundamentals of the German language, with a focus on grammar and vocabulary. German is a strange language, but it's well-taught here, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning it. The class was also really enjoyable with various projects, videos, and songs. The workload is incredibly manageable.",
    "Take it! you will learn a lot about the German language in just one semester and the work is really light!",
    "I would recommend Introductory German to someone interested in picking up a new language. The workload is not too difficult, and you'll leave the class with a basic understanding of German.",
    "This class was a wonderful way to knock out a language credit. I took it because I wanted to learn German, not to fulfill the requirement, but it was never too much work. I really enjoyed it.",
    "Natuerlich!",
    "Take this class if you already took German in high school. No one will stop you and you'll get an easy A.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best L1's at Yale. Also the entire department is really attractive.",
    "I would recommend it, but be prepared for a lot of grammar rules. The grammar, though, is the fundamental basis of the language.",
    "I would recommend this class very highly to another student, as I learned a great deal from a great teacher, the class was a lot of fun, and it has made me very interested in the German language when at first I had a hard time deciding which language I wanted to take in college and wasn't sure how I would like German."
