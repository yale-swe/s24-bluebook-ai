    "John Rogers is one of the most incisive and kind-hearted professors I've had the luck of having at Yale. Utopia is a subject matter that may not be immediately attractive to students. And some of these texts are very strange and inscrutable (in particular, Looking Backwards and Blazing World). But professor Rogers deftly navigates and elucidates every one of these works. And don't worry, the utopian oeuvre also includes masterpieces like Gulliver's Travels and We as well as strange gems like Herland. There is a book and several essays of reading per week, along with one 5 page short paper, and a 20 page final paper. These are all manageable (and frankly familiar for English majors). The final paper has a stream of built in deadlines, constructed to help procrastinators from hurting themselves (what I mean to say is, thank you). Professor Rogers reads every piece of work closely and gives comprehensive and generous feedback. I have become a better logician and manipulator of prose as a result. I have left this course enriched in my knowledge of the subject, but even more than that, a lover of a genre I originally was ambivalent about. I feel so lucky to have taken this course in my final semester at Yale. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great reading, great prof. Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENGL 414 to a fellow student, especially if the idea of the utopia is of any interest. ENGL 414 was an absolutely fantastic course. While I was not as familiar with the more philosophical elements of the class, these elements helped provide an effective framework that remained useful throughout the rest of the course. The genre of the utopia is also an incredibly strange one, but the class helped to work its way through the strangeness of the texts in a thoughtful and thought-provoking manner. I wish we had been able to ride a few more speculative fictions at the end of the course (perhaps an even more modern utopia than Zamyatin`s We) but I think we were able to cover a fair amount in a short amount of time.",
    "I would highly recommend it! It made me think about lots of new themes and exposed me to a whole new genre that will influence the way I think about literature, politics and science.",
    "Amazing, amazing class. John Rogers is a joy to have a class with and the syllabus is fascinating with a mix of better known texts and things you wouldn't know existed if you didn't take this class. You should absolutely take this class as a senior requirement or just for fun!!",
    "This course like the genre marries many disciplines, including political science, philosophy, English, history, and WGSS. It is impossible to be bored by the syllabus, which while heavy on content pre-1800, does include such a variety as Plato, Sir Thomas More, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Margaret Cavendish, Jorge Luis Borges, etc. As a student outside the English major, I found the reading and writing workload very manageable, including the final paper, given that a WR credit is awarded. I would also strongly recommend any course taught by Professor Rogers whose criticism of my writing and facilitation of discussion were equally helpful and pleasant.",
    "It's a fairly good course, but make sure you're okay with the sort of books you'll be reading (not exactly fine literature).",
    "A survey of the utopic genre which brings you in contact with a number of fascinating texts that you might not otherwise encounter anywhere else in the English department. Utopic literature is weird - and delightful - and Professor Rogers could not be a more encouraging and knowledgeable prof with whom to take the course.",
    "Take the course if you can; the other students will be engaging, Professor Rogers is erudite, charming, learned, and interesting. The syllabus is amazing. You'll learn so much; you'll produce work you're actually proud of."
