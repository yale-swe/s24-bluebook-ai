    "For someone who does not love philosophy, this was a really enjoyable course. Professor Kapustin makes students think by asking important questions, but then synthesizes student responses so they are understandable for everyone. Sadly, I heard that Professor Kapustin is leaving next year - he is the main reason that this class was so successful for me.",
    "A wonderful, rigorous, and insightful introduction to 7 historically important interdisciplinary thinkers. Definitely recommend. One of those best classes at Yale that we are paying the tuition for.",
    "I am so sad professor Kapustin is leaving Yale. This class was mind opening in the way that I dreamed Yale would be. I learned so much about the evolution of intellectual thought in the Western world and Kapustin has this way of getting so excited about the material that is very engaging. He definitely draws out nuances and contradictions and makes you think really hard about the readings. Classmates were very on top of readings, and it seemed like most people did some, if not all of them so discussions were good.",
    "EP&E 215, as the name would suggest, is an overview and in depth look into the classics of ethics, politics, and economics. We read authors ranging from Aristotle to Hayek. You read about 70-100 pages for week, write a midterm and final paper and participate a lot in class. The final paper is more creative. Yes, I would definitely recommend EP&E 215 to any non-EP&E major who is able to get in. The material is important to get to know, even as a non-major.",
    "I'd recommend this if you're really into political philosophy and liked DS. If you have to take this course for one reason or another, take it with Boris Kapustin. Kapustin is truly brilliant. Don't get scared off my the intro lecture during shopping week. He's pretty intense, but sort of remains in his own sphere. He's not intense with or at students. He just really cares about the material. So, don't be scared! Take it, I would say, if you want to read the authors on the syllabus. Work: It's a lot of reading, but you don't need to do all of it. 1 midterm paper, 1 final paper. Medium level of work; could be a lot if you do all the reading.",
    "This course has been, without exaggeration, the best that I have taken in my Yale career thus far, and I am not sure that very many in the future can come close to topping it. The course covers a wide swath of intellectual history, from Ancient Greece (Aristotle) to the Scottish Enlightenment (Hume, Ferguson), and 19th (Bentham, Hegel) and 20th (Hayek, Schumpeter) century thinkers. Moreover, true to the major for which this course is required, the ethical, political, AND economic dimensions of each authors philosophy is considered, making this course multifaceted and enriching. Yet, at the same time, the course did not sacrifice depth for breadth, and I felt that I came away with a strong and in-depth grasp of each author. Prof. Kapustin is a tremendously compelling and engaging lecturer; his insightful lectures at once dissect the texts and elucidate their significance in intellectual history. Prof. Kapustin is also quite helpful and accessible as well, providing thorough feedback on writing assignments. The workload is quite reasonable, with only a 6 page take-home midterm and a 15-page final paper, and the readings, while often difficult, are manageable and elucidated well by lectures. Here are my tips for succeeding and getting the most out of the course: 1) Do the reading and take thorough and well-organized notes (this helps much in actively participating in discussion, in writing essays, and in enjoying this course intellectually) 2) Make sure to send your essay outlines for the midterm and final essays to Prof. Kapustin; he provides very helpful feedback on them 3) Start writing early, especially the final paper, as this can definitely take a lot of stress off of this course 4) Enjoy reading and studying these truly classic works of political philosophy! While this is a required course for EP&E majors, I would strongly recommend anyone who might be able to get in to take it; the course, the works studied in it, and the professor are not to be missed.",
    "It's compulsory for EP&E majors but also take it if you are wavering between EP&E and other majors.",
    "Kapustin is great! Definitely take classics with him. He is a great lecturer in section and allows for very free discussion. IT is quite an experience and the assignments are straightforward: one 6 page take-home midterm exam and a final paper",
    "Take it without a doubt! Excellent readings, wonderful professor, not too stressful.",
    "Classics is a requirement of the EP&E core where you will read philosophers and political theorist's perspectives on the relationship between ethics, politics, and economics. We read works from Aristotle, Hume, Ferguson, Bentham, Hegel, Hayek, and Schumpeter, discussing the ideal state, democracy, property, utilitarianism, the master-slave dialectic, capitalism, and socialism. It's a wonderful class and one that attracts non-majors sometimes because of the interesting readings and class discussion. You are generally assigned ~70 pages of reading a week, which everyone normally does, and you basically answer Professor Kapustin's in-class questions on the material to help work through the key arguments in the readings. Unlike Professor Kagan's intro ethics class, this course is very much focused on close reading and analysis of the authors and not exclusively philosophical concepts (detached from their appearance in an author's book). Though there is probably some overlap between this class and DS classes or intro political philosophy classes, even if you are reading some authors for a second time, Professor Kapustin really does focus on particular arguments and aspects of the readings, so you will definitely come away with something new. BUT, as a heads up, this class feels very intense (even though you only have a mid-term essay and a final essay). That's because, to some degree, the stereotype about EP&E majors being section assholes sort of comes alive when everyone is literally scavenging for quotes and thoughts to seem clever and well-read. In some cases, people use language more complicated and convoluted than even the authors do to describe things that could be explained in way fewer words. If you take this class, please try to contribute to a more collaborative, less aggressive class environment that is less about proving your intelligence to your classmates and professor and more about admitting that you found some of the reading difficult and working through tough concepts and mutual confusion together. It'll make you and everyone else much much better off. Also, this class seems to have a little bit of rightwards bias, so get ready if that's not your thing. It may help you understand the assumptions that are critical to the conservative viewpoint which might help you defend your own perspective or equip you with the knowledge to create a strong intellectual takedown of the right. Overall, it's a great course - 10\/10, would recommend!"
