    "It covered a lot of different topics and you learn a lot about whatever you present on. It's a good science credit, but not the best experience overall.",
    "yes if they want a relatively easy science credit.",
    "A great science seminar for non-science majors.",
    "This is a solid class and easy way to get a SC credit. It is BARELY any work. You have an annoying PSet once a week but it will take 2 hours top. You will learn some cool facts about how certain technologies work (electricity, cars, planes, radio, tv, medical imaging, etc.). This class will not teach you some overall concepts or underlying thought as Dr. Prober hopes it will. That being said, Prober is super nice and easy to work with. You will do a group presentation for about 30% of your grade and it is pretty easy and a cool way to learn more. I recommend this if you need a quick SC credit."
