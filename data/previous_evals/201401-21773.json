    "Take this course if you want to study classics or Greek literature. It spends 10 hours a week preparing you to read anything.",
    "This is a LOT of work, it deserves to be two credits. Keep that in mind when choosing your other classes. I would take this course again, if I would have had a lesser workload in the semester. Also ,you finish the Plato's Apology in one semester!",
    "The course title sums it up well. Take \"intensive\" seriously. You will work a lot, but you will know two semesters' worth of a language at the end of one. If you learn languages best by constant drilling and slow steps, as I do, this probably isn't the class for you.",
    "I am not sure whether I would recommend this course; if I could do this semester over, I would seriously reconsider the decision to take Turbo Ancient Greek. I didn\u2019t think it over sufficiently beforehand, and once I jumped into it, it was a major shock to the system. It is an enormous amount of work, especially at the beginning but really throughout. It was easily the hardest class (and semester) I have ever had at Yale, and this is after two semesters of DS. I had had no prior acquaintance with classical languages, which I think was a minor (but not a significant) hindrance. Knowledge of Romance languages helps very little. I think the biggest hurdle was really the time and the drudgery. Greek is a much more complicated language than English and the grammar simply takes a lot of time and memorization to grasp. The promise of this course is to have you reading Plato\u2019s Apology by the end. True, we did finish reading it, and there were flashes of understanding, but still, it is a very exacting course of study. Professor Robinson was very kind, very patient, always willing to meet before class to help students. At times I felt he was prone to call on students he knew would do well, and so inferred (sometimes incorrectly) that everyone knew whatever material we were discussing that day. One note of warning, if you decide to take Greek 125 and Professor Robinson is still teaching it: Professor Robinson is receptive to student feedback, but be direct. We, for instance, got him to institute a five-minute break an hour into class, but we always had to remind him to give us the break; he sometimes forgets those kinds of things, so be sure to be clear. Also, if you are someone who cares about the way other students in class behave, beware: there\u2019s likely to be some section assholery in Greek 125. And please, please don\u2019t take 5 credits when you take this class; it is hellish, and you may very well end up dropping the fourth class\/fifth credit. And please, don\u2019t do this for the wrong reasons! Only do this if you have to for your major or you truly truly care about the classics. Otherwise you are going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place because this class isn\u2019t really droppable.",
    "A huge course commitment. You may love it or hate it, but more likely do a bit of both.",
    "It is what it is, an intensive course in Ancient Greek. Do it because you're very motivated to learn Ancient Greek--whether it is Homer, Plato, or Sappho you want to read some day--otherwise there's probably a better way to spend 10 hours of class at 9:25 each morning. Be prepared to keep up to pace because it's almost impossible to catch up if you fall behind midway. Assessments aren't cumbersome and the reward of being able to read the Apology in class in the last month is worth your work. Again, think twice if this is the thing you want to do."
