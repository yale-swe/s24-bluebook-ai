   "comments": [
    "Good for a fun fifth class. Same stuff as SCIE 030 -- a range of lecturers that vary in quality and interestingness. Not a heavy workload and a lot of interesting topics covered.",
    "Sci 031 is a seminar that is taught like a lecture. It is nice that modules change every three weeks so you get to learn a little about a broad range of relevant topics. I wish that the class included more discussion\/interaction between students. Expect little to no work the first two weeks of a module and a lot the third (quiz, project or paper, and usually a p-set).",
    "There are a lot of great freshman seminars, but if you are willing to try something a little different than the typical seminar, this is a great course. It is also very very accessible for people who have very little background in the sciences and probably don't want to study science in much depth at Yale.",
    "While it only meets once a week, the Friday meeting time takes a toll on you. The assignments every three weeks can sometimes be challenging and highly time consuming. Overall it is not as easy as you would expect.",
    "Workload pretty light, food on Fridays was awesome if you could sit through the hour and a half on Friday afternoon. I liked second semester a lot actually. The workload is basically none for two weeks and everything on the third week.",
    "This class is a great freshman seminar. There is very little work, and there are cookies every class. Win win.",
    "SCI 031 (a continuation of SCI 030) is a great class for both science and non-science majors who are interested in learning more about cool and up-and-coming fields in science. The units (3 weeks long each) this year ranged from astronomy to genetically modified organisms to statistics to hydrogen energy and fuel cells, and I was highly interested in all of them.Pros:- Homework load is very light - only homework\/small project and a quiz every 3 weeks at the end of the unit. No midterms, no final!- Broad coverage of cool subject matter- Coffee and tea and cookies and brownies at every class!- Small seminar class (~16), all freshmen. I really enjoyed getting to know my classmates, and I'll really miss this group next year!Cons:- Offered Friday afternoons this year from 1:30 - 3PM - can be hard for some people- Sometimes hard to do the psets with so few classes on a subject, BUT this can be fixed by either meeting with the professor or working with classmates - and working with classmates is definitely the most fun and easy way to go.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. Especially id your are not interested in the sciences, because it is a great way to be introduced to such a wide variety of them.",
    "If you are at all interested in cutting edge science and you don't take this class, you're making a mistake."
