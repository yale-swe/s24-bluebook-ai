   "comments": [
    "The course actually taught me a very intricate, specific, and technical understand of the immune system and all its parts. I was initially surprised by how of the course was actually focused on learning the biological mechanisms that make up the immune system--I expected the class to be more surface level and focused on different diseases and experiences of diseases. It actually does a great job of explaining diseases and their symptoms and then connecting those stories to the mechanisms that create them.",
    "A broad understanding of how our immune system functions as well as a variety of diseases that either initiate or result from an immune response.",
    "Specific ins and outs of the innate and adaptive immune system. Focus on Polio, HIV\/AIDs and TB.",
    "In this course I learned a lot more about the intricacies of the immune system. I had learned a general overview in high school biology, but being able to look at specific mechanisms and cells gave me a greater appreciation for the body's defense system. I liked that in addition to discussing scientific concepts, we also focused on social concepts. This included when we read the book documenting the polio vaccination drive and how it affected US society, as well as going to the Art Gallery and seeing art related to HIV\/AIDS.",
    "I felt that this class provided a deep insight into the world of immunology and the many different parts that make the immune system function. I feel as though I can explain immunological concepts with decent comfort.",
    "All about immunology and microbes. Pleasantly surprised that we learned a lot about the history of certain diseases as well as the biological background. Was able to put the information into perspective!",
    "I learned a lot about the immune system and how my body functions.",
    "I learned in depth about the immune system, both the anatomy and physiology.",
    "This class gives a comprehensive overview of the innate and adaptive immune systems of the body and how our immune cells respond to harmful pathogens.",
    "The function and processes of immunological systems.",
    "We learned in-depth about the immune system and the various cells and mechanisms responsible for an immune response to different pathogens. We also learned about other related topics including Polio, HIV\/AIDS, and Henrietta Lacks\/HeLa cells.",
    "More than I can write here. The class explains so incredibly much about the immune system and our health. But I wasn't drowning in facts. It was not hard to take it in, it was just a lot. And all so incredibly relevant because it's our bodies and it's about stuff that happens all the time. Like, I understand all about vaccines, and allergies, and big public health campaigns like for polio.",
    "I developed a deep understanding of the immune system",
    "By taking this course, I gained a better understanding of the innate and adaptive immune system, alongside the array of intricacies in diseases and viruses. Not only did I learn how to manage my time wisely through challenging, weekly Problem Sets, but also gained much needed insight into my career path in the long run."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course is very interesting and does a great job of teaching both the science of the immune system and the importance of the immune system in culture. I think at times the class felt too repetitive (always a scientific lecture followed by a discussion or review of the previous lecture), so it was hard to stay engaged.",
    "The content of this course is very thorough in providing a broad introduction. I think it is great as is.",
    "The content is interesting but might feel overwhelming for non-science majors. The content is covered pretty quickly and reading outside of class is necessary to stay on track.",
    "It was really difficult to learn when questions were often not answered and the class was structured on reading directly what the slides said. The class was not very engaging and I ended up teaching myself the material by doing my own research.",
    "I think one of the largest strengths of this course is that it is a seminar. The smaller class size and focus on discussion not only helped me to understand the material being taught, but also helped me to get to know my classmates well.",
    "A strength of the course was the small class size, so it was easy to ask questions and interact with the professor. Although I liked this, I do feel as though there could have been a little more room for student to student interaction in more discussions about the lectures rather than discussions about just readings.",
    "Strengths: The professor, workload, teaching methods Weakness: Nothing!",
    "Strength: This course teaches you a lot about the immune system. By the time you finish, you will be able to understand academic papers (to a certain degree) and even how different immunotherapies work. Weaknesses: Immunology is a very hard subject. It will be difficult to keep up in the class, and the PSETs can be difficult because sometimes expectations are not clear. At first, this course did not seem very science-heavy, but it does get increasingly harder.",
    "The strength of this course was the discussion based format, because I learned a great deal through the discussions that combined with the topics of the daily lecture. A weakness was the unclear grading of problem sets, as I never knew what answer Professor Kavathas was looking for.",
    "The seminar style of the class makes it easier to ask questions and understand the material; however, for non-biology majors, this class has a pretty fast pace and it can be difficult to keep up at times.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kavathas is a wonderful professor, and I enjoyed the structure of the class where we would start with a review of the previously learned topic, then move to the lecture on the day's topic, and end class with a discussion on the assigned reading. Professor Kavathas always made sure that everyone had a chance to speak during class discussions, creating a very positive classroom atmosphere. This class had the most welcoming environment of all of my classes so far. Also, I really enjoyed the trip to the art gallery to look at HIV\/AIDS-related artwork. Weakness: Sometimes, there were few opportunities to work with learned material. Some of the concepts were more abstract than others and sometimes it felt a little rushed to only discuss them twice (during lecture and during the review in the next class).",
    "Prof K was a big strength. You could tell from the first day she wanted to be there and cared about the material and us. She gave us a big course packet with information about the material (like explaining cell types and such), which was really useful during the semester, and printed the powerpoints each class for us to take notes on. It moved logically and was full of really interesting information. Field trips were great!! I also really appreciated the books on polio and Henrietta Lacks. Really important stuff to know. I can't think of an improvement.",
    "I liked that I learned both about the science and the social impact of the diseases we studied",
    "One strength of this course would have to be the discussion. After a dense reading on the history of Polio or that of Henrietta Cells, I got the chance to dive into class discussion on the texts, not only exchanging ideas that I considered fruitful to my understanding of the topic, but also getting the chance to hear the voices of scholars with similar interests as mine. One weakness of this course would have to be the lack of one-on-one help. While answering Problem Sets, I found myself stumped. While I depended on the help of other students to have some of my questions answered, I attempted to ask the teacher for assistance as well, but never received concrete feedback that answered my questions."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to science majors and non-science people alike.",
    "I would very much recommend this course, especially if you are on the fence about taking a science course. This course was very inspiring and the subject matter was fascinating.",
    "If you like science and you want to learn the content (not just get a science credit) , Yes! There are also people that went into the course with out any intent to explore the sciences and came out very interested in doing so.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this to other students. Everyone told me that I should take a freshman seminar and I was really excited for this course. Im really interested in immunology and wanted to learn more. This class was not engaging and the structure did not foster a productive learning environment. The professor clearly favored some students over others. For the students she didnt favor, she often ignored their questions.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they have a good understanding of molecular biology and an interest in the immune system. This course can get rather technical with immune system mechanisms and components, but if the student is willing to engage and ask questions to improve their understanding, they should enjoy the class.",
    "I would recommend this class if the student has a deep interest in understanding how the immune system works. The concepts can be fairly difficult to grasp at first, but if a student is willing to study and work towards the concepts I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it was an extremely informative, fun first-year seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in biology who want to have a better understanding of how our bodies respond to disease. A strong biology background is helpful, but not essential.",
    "Yes if you are pationate about biology. No if you are not.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, regardless of major. A lot of what we learned was good knowledge to have on the functions of the immune system and on the history of popular diseases.",
    "YES!! First-years, this is a perfect first-year seminar. It is super interesting no matter what major you are. It's a SC credit if you need that but even if you don't, it is so interesting and relevant. Diseases are a big part of our world. You're going to (or already) know someone with cancer, or HIV, or the flu. You should be able to understand them on a basic level. This class will do that for you. And Prof K teaches it in a nice way and is fun to be around.",
    "yes! I think everyone should know about the immune system because it impacts everyone.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student fully interest in the topic and with a schedule that allots them enough time to devote."
