    "Great class, a lot of work, very little structure though, so be prepared, but it is a great experience and you learn a lot. Prof. Musser is very helpful and talented and will offer great advice when consulted.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to people who have the patience and the ambition to make a film on a subject they care a lot about.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone wanting to work on their own documentary for a year. The resources it provides you are a very rare privilege, and all the people involved invest themselves totally into your production.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Take the class only if you have a burning need to make a documentary. It's difficult to make a movie while at Yale, so you've really got to want to do it and not just want to have done it. There's remarkably little structure, so you've got to be self-directed."
