    "The only reason I do not give Dana the highest score for overall instructor, is because he is very aware of his ability to apply pressure to us as students through the course's grading scheme and assignment structure. I think he takes pleasure in knowing how uncomfortable these things are for us students, but that this is indeed the best way to learn the GIS material. Dana is engaging, professional, encouraging, creative, and overall made to be a grad school professor. I hope to take his class next semester as well.",
    "This is an excellent course for those who want to learn GIS. There's just enough instruction to guide you in the right direction, but you really learn GIS by experimenting\/playing around with the program and getting familiar with how things work.",
    "While the lectures were helpful, for the most part, the assignments were often time consuming and not necessarily building applicable skills. The instructor does not seem particularly interested in the environmental bent of our school, and the assignment for our final project reflected that. The TA was also kind of swamped towards the end of the semester (handling so many students and their questions) and I really felt like we were working with pretty limited GIS staff resources. Can we hire a full time GIS professor at F&ES?",
    "Dana is a character. He is very responsive, but in his own way, which is not usually very helpful.",
    "It was hard to understand what exactly Professor Tomlin was looking for in homework assignments. Even though we were able to view other students' assignment submissions, I was often confused as to why my submissions were routinely described as \"average.\" I wish we had more applied assignments, as if we would be working with a particular client for a GIS project. Ultimately, I felt like a came away from the course with a decent level of basic GIS knowledge, but I desired more applied work.",
    "This was the first software-based course I have ever taken, and I was very nervous to do so as someone without a strong computer background. The first half of this class was really hard for me, and I depended a lot on assistance from the TA. But, after an initial steep learning curve, I came to really enjoy the work, became much more comfortable with the software, and was able to problem solve on my own. I don't know that everyone in the course really got to this point (especially because this class is a really new way of learning for many students), but Dana's teaching style worked very well for me. Dana is a great teacher - very clear and thoughtful, well-designed assignments, accessible to students.",
    "This course is essential to many courses and career paths that students at FES may embark upon. However, the speed and coursework is extremely heavy when compared to those given from other classes. I'm unsure on how to improve the class given the density of information and time processing it requires but I do know that there is scope for improving the pedagogy and student\/instructor interaction. It's also interesting that the class portion of the course was almost redundant given that the majority of learning took part outside class and was to be completed on ones own motivation and the instructors material. It would be nice to have a more theoretical backing to ArcGIS while in class rather than go through the same material as we would do out of class."

    "I now have this whole new skill set and a renewed faith in my ability to learn complicated tools like GIS. This course offers the unique experience of getting to know your peers through their work and working together through difficult problems remotely, two things I had never had before in any other class. Dana does not overwhelm the course by making it both raster and vector or by making us learn python code, however he does give us the opportunity and resources we need to do this ourselves if at any point during the semester we want to up our learning experience.",

    "Excellent introduction to basic use of vector-based GIS. Tutorials included in each week's agenda were extremely helpful for learning that week's content. Final project was an effective method of assessing semester work. Grading style for weekly homework assignments was effective and allowed for flexibility related to student workloads.",
    "The best aspect of the course was the course's purpose: to become familiar with ArcGIS.",

   "comments": [
    "There should be a formal lab for this course, where we walk through the tutorial together sitting at computers. I understand questions can bog down lab sessions, but if you can control this aspect I think it would be very useful. It's very difficult at least the first few weeks to get a hold on the techniques used in GIS. It's also hard to work from the handouts alone without a TA. We needed more than one TA and halfway through the semester we got one, but it was a little late. If there cannot be a lab, having two TA's from the beginning would be very beneficial.",
    "more TAs as of day one more guidance of final project earlier NO poster competition. That was a complete waste of everyone's time and I don't appreciate students trying to be smart asses in there poster and getting a whole grade bumped up when there poster did not reflect teh time and work invested in the final project.",
    "The time spent during class needs to be re-assessed so that we spend more time on hands-on practice with the professor instead of theoretical lectures of the GIS tools.",
    "Applicability of homework assignments and final. My partner has worked as a GIS consultant for six years and really felt that how we were learning and using GIS in the class was not applicable to a professional setting, which is why most of us are taking the class.",
    "In short I wish Dana would be more explicit about his pedagogy and what that means compared to traditional classes. I like his end goal of getting you to be more proactive than reactive, but I really really dislike that he gives an aura of laissez-faire while he secretly has a very specific set of criteria that he doesn't make visible. If he would 1) write out on the homeworks that he is looking for you to show how you did what you did, and at what detail he is looking for in that regard (does it need to be a how-to manual for somebody who has never done it before or does it need to be a list of high-level processes that Dana would understand the details?) and 2) that he would do more to encourage those who aren't already inclined to go out of their way to ask individual questions to the teacher to do so, that would be much appreciated! He self-admits that he has designed the course for those who go out of their way to ask him questions (proactive instead of reactive). He provides absolutely no feedback on weekly assignments (he buckets them into \"great, good, average, weak, and terrible\"), and expects you to look at the great ones to know what you should do. Two problems with this: 1) there are few clear patterns that differentiate the different buckets. I would wager a year of tuition that if Dana sorted them 10 times, there would be 10 different arrangements. So I did not find these buckets as useful in feedback, 2) He doesn't tell you on the assignment what he is looking for - namely he wants you to explain to him HOW you did what you did, rather than simply make a map. Unfortunately, the assignments listed on the word docs do not list this AT ALL.",
    "There needs to be come lab time, even if that lab time is optional.",
    "Grading should be based on weekly assignments and the final terminal project instead of only terminal project.",
    "It was rare to use the complete three hours of class. In this sense, it would be nice if the class was divided into two sections. The first half could be the lecture of the instructor and the second could be in the laboratory interacting with the software. This would allow students to take advantage of the complete class and familiarize more easily with the contents learned during the lecture.",
    "It would help to give a quick overview of where each class is going at the beginning of class. Sometimes I found myself furiously writing down notes about a particular function without knowing how that function would eventually fit in.",
    "In some instances, a lab-based course would have been helpful.",
    "Communication about what is expected from the homework; more applied assignments.",
    "The one thing I might change about this class is the grading method; so much work goes into the weekly assignments that having the entire grade rest on our final project was a bit frustrating. Having two TA's rather than one makes good sense to me; I think we especially could have used the second TA earlier in the semester.",
    "This is really more than a 3-credit course, given the time required to master the material. The ArcGIS program itself can use refinement in its programming. That timeliness was stressed more than mastery can tend to compound weakness in working with the material.",
    "The course needs to taken for more credits. At least 4 credits should be awarded for this course. The final project and homework takes up a considerable amount of time and the grading system does not consider homework. With the entire grade being derived from the final project, the course puts a lot of pressure on the students.",
    "Rather than have the course taught entirely as a lecture, it would have been helpful to have a few classes taught in the computer lab so that there could have been more \"hands on\" learning with ArcGIS.",
    "The class itself wasnt as relevant to the learning process as the assignments were. Maybe we could have made a better use of our time reviewing cases or situations in the real world were the GIS tools are being used to solve environmental problems. Guest speakers would also make a big contribution. We rarely used all of the class time, so I se a big room for improvement in this sense. I also think that the applied side of the course (weekly assignments) should be better balanced with cartography theory. We should have a stronger background on projection systems, coordinate systems, scales, etc. Maybe some further readings on this field would help.",
    "n\/a",
    "The entire grade is your final project. Which is a pain if you've worked hard all semester and are burnt out by the end.",

I don't regret taking it although there were times during the semester when I felt like I will not be able to do the next assignment. In the end, what you learn is invaluable! You get to know how to do \"cool\" stuff. When you pick an article or a book and you see a map, you smile knowing that you can do something more sophisticated than what you are seeing.",

The assignments do not list this as a requirement, but it is the main purpose. 2) Dana is much better to talk with in person than in email. It can be frustrating to ask questions on piazza or via email because he takes your questions at face value. The good thing is he will make you ask better questions, the bad thing is it can be a very frustrating process. 3) Email\/talk to Dana often and on individual basis to get specific feedback on your work. Otherwise you won't get any useful critiques. 4) The weekly assignments do NOT count for any of your grade. Give yourself a set number of hours to do the assignment and don't spend more time on it, otherwise you will go crazy. 5) bring your computer to class to do GIS during lecture, and download the tutorials before class so you are ready to go when dana runs through them during lecture. Every word Dana says is carefully thought out, so it requires 100% attention, but it is a very dry subject and easy to overlook a few words and miss something. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification. Computer helps keep the focus. Also take additional notes on the agendas per his discussion in class. 6) Use piazza!",

It is a big contribution for students with no previous exposure to ArcGIS. If you have already worked with ArcGIS or if you are really good at learning by doing with new softwares, it is more recommended to take the Modelling Geographic Space course, which is less intuitive and gives you a more advanced perspective of working in the geographic space. Dana Tomlin is a very good instructor and the assignments are well designed to increase in complexity throughout the course. Dont expect a huge amount of cartographic theory, this is a very skill oriented course.",
