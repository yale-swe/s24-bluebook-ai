   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in teaching or researching in 20th-century U.S. history. It is also instrumental in preparing for the oral exams.",
    "I loved this course! It really shored up my knowledge of historiography of the long twentieth century from the Populist and Progressive Era and Spanish-American War to the Civil Rights Movement through the present.",
    "This is a crash course in 20th century US history. Essential for anybody doing research in this period.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student of American history as they are preparing for orals. The bibliographies we all help to build will be helpful in making a reading list.",
    "History 735 was structured around readings of both classic monographs and innovative recent scholarship on the social and political history of the US in the 20th century. Professor Gilmore encouraged students to put these texts in creative conversation with each other, in ways that thought critically about larger historiography. Within this focus on various historical arguments that have shaped the field, the texts themselvesand our class discussionsprovided a thorough overview of nuts and bolts issues that any scholar of 20th century history must know. (The most badass and wonderful moment of the class was when Prof. Gilmore responded to student griping about David Kennedys *Freedom from Fear* by writing New Deal acronyms on the chalkboard and making us define them, and then leading a discussion about how you have to know your stuff in order to actually making a critique people will listen to. I will remember this forever. We all got told.) The rigor of the reading schedule and the thoughtful structure that Prof. Gilmore has created for the class helps students to be better, more careful readers and to connect texts across thematic, temporal, and disciplinary boundaries. There is no doubt that the class prepares us to teach an introductory survey course. The assignments are practical in the best wayswe wrote three book reviews over the course of the semester (which offered opportunities to improve them), presented orally every other week, and compiled an orals list. I came into the class having heard critical comments about the tight structure that is the hallmark of Prof. Gilmores readings classes, and also from a history department at my previous school that is famed for cutthroat, unsupportive seminars where students are hazed. So I was nervous! But I found the structure to be one of the most anti-racist and feminist methods that Ive experienced, because the structure created room for everyone to participate and take risksas opposed to an open-season non-structure where arrogant white guys will inevitably take over. This did not happen in 735. Instead, this was a class that saw relatively equal participation across the board. This was a class where students were pushed to the edges of our interpretation and supported in the process, not just by Prof. Gilmore, but also by each other. Finally, the class built fabulous camaraderie among students doing 20th century history, across departments. It presented consistent opportunities for us to get together (both as discussion leaders and small groups) and discuss books and papers. By the end of the semester, there was solidarity and conversation among students not just about the coursework in 735, but also about our other classes that we didnt necessarily share. I read so many papers from fellow students, and they read mine. I really think this is partly an outgrowth of the supportive atmosphere that 735 created. So, it may be obvious by now: I would unequivocally recommend this class to ANY student. It was the best class I took this semester, for its content, for the discussion and the historical overview, for the relationships it helped facilitate. I looked forward to class every day and was sad on the day when I couldnt be there. I feel very lucky to have been in this class.",
    "735 is a required introduction to historiographical questions in 20th c. American history. I would recommend the class, with the understanding that it is less structured and more demanding than most.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. It provides a superb foundation in American social and political history with an eye to formulating your own historical analysis and preparing for future teaching in the field.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to another student, even one not necessarily pursuing a specialism closely intertwined with the topics covered. This is because the nature of the reading and writing requirements was challenging and valuable beyond the utility of the content of the course itself.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a solid starting place in 20th c. U.S. history.",
    "Broad survey course of twentieth century history. I would recommend this course to another student."

   "comments": [
    "This class was very important in deepening my knowledge of the history discipline, and the field of American history in particular.",
    "It really shored up my knowledge of historiography of the long twentieth century from the Populist and Progressive Era and Spanish-American War to the Civil Rights Movement through the present. felt that I'm more comfortable with various fields of historiography outside of my focus on post-WWII history.",
    "This is more of an \"orals course\" than a \"dissertation course,\" but on that count it was immensely successful.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the discipline and provided a strong foundation in the field. Certain course readings have very much influenced my thinking as well as exposed me to new questions, sources, and themes that I am eager to pursue further in my own research.",
    "The course (re)introduced me to the major questions of 20th century US historiography, and provided a number of readings that have prompted further inquiry for my own research. The final project was also an excellent assignment in this regard because it both made sense as a capstone to the class and also will serve me going forward in concrete ways.",
    "The opportunity to create an orals list was helpful preparation for the next phase of the program, as was the frequent opportunity to read and discuss authors in conversation with each other. It allowed explicit engagement with debates in political history, and helped me understand how historians in a field different from my own frame questions and significance.",
    "I learned a lot about how books are constructed and how to put different texts in conversation with one another. I improved my academic writing and learned how to write book reviews. I feel like I understood a lot more about the process of constructing orals lists by the end of the class and through the final project."
