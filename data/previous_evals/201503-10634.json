   "comments": [
    "For anyone trying to get a good grasp of Latin American history and the motors of rebellion, as well as its consequences, this class is a must.",
    "Hist 807 is an incredible introduction to resistance studies as applied to Latin America. Professor Joseph leads a great seminar where everyone is comfortable participating and the level of discussion is very high. Some highlights of the class were James Scott, Henri Roph Truillot, and much of the modern scholarship on resistance studies.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student seeking a new approach to a Latin American survey course and a deep engagement with Latin American politics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student, because of the lens provides a way to think about resistance, rebellion, and survival historically.",
    "All students interested in rebellion and related questions should take this course. Historians have much to learn from anthropologists, and vice versa. I especially appreciated the anthropology readings because I had not encountered most of them."

   "comments": [
    "This class expanded my working knowledge of Latin American history and politics and gave me several potential research questions to explore in the future.",
    "It gave me a clear sense of the types of evidence to use when making arguments along the lines of resistance, rebellion, and survival.",
    "Although I loved this course, I had already read most of the historical monographs. I propose updating some of the readings. Two suggestions immediately come to mind: 1) Michelle Chase's Revolution within the Revolution: Women and Gender in Cuba, 1952-62 (UNC, 2015) 2) Natalia Milanesio's Workers Go Shopping in Argentina: The Rise of Consumer Culture (Duke, 2013\/15). Finally, I would like to thank the professor for his commitment to making Yale an inclusive community for everyone and for his efforts to promote collegiality both in and outside the classroom. I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner! For the IT people who prepared this evaluation, please note that I had a number of problems submitting it. (I am a PC user.) I initially wrote detailed comments, but after they were deleted twice before I could submit them, I opted for a briefer endorsement of this course."
