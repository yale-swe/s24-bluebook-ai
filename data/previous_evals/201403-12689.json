   "comments": [
    "This is a difficult course, and it's a lot of work. I would not recommend it unless you need to take it. This was Prof. Gomez's first time teaching this course, so it's possible the difficulty partially stemmed from that.",
    "This is a fairly easy course that does not require a lot of prior knowledge to understand, as Gomez is an excellent lecturer. Not a lot of work, and the few problem sets are very easy to work through. Definitely take this course, even if you are a non-engineer who needs distributional requirements.",
    "If you have to take it you have to take it. If you want to go into energy or environment field at any (read ANY) capacity, you should take it. If you are looking for a gut class this is not your easy science credit. It will make you cry.",
    "Don't take this if you're not ABET MechE, at least not with Professor Gomez. The material can be conceptually difficult, which is fine, but lecture moves very quickly, and if you haven't read ahead (which is hard to do since we don't always know what sections will be covered) it is easy to get lost. The book is also not great - I often learned a lot more quickly from a bit of Wikipedia reading. Problem sets are long, incredibly tedious and not at all rewarding, since the bulk of your time will be spent crunching ugly numbers rather than solidifying your understanding of the concepts. The exams, structured similarly to the homework problems, were super stressful and much too long to finish in the given time. The highlight of the course was getting to tour one of Yale's power plants, which was fascinating. All in all it was an incredibly frustrating course that will take up more of your time than it's worth, which is a shame because the material is fundamental and actually pretty interesting.",
    "You probably have to take this class if you're a MechE or ChemE. If you think you can \"get out of it\" and just take other classes which have Thermo as a prereq (as I thought about doing), this was all new material to me, and it intersected a lot with Fluids (I anticipate it'll interact a lot with other classes too). It's fundamental, and it's not stuff you know from intro physics. I'm glad I took it. Gomez is hilarious, and gets that it's not that serious. He sometimes moves a bit fast, and his tests are really difficult (\"no one walks out on my tests\"), but he cares and he checks in with how students are doing as he lectures. He also will know your name, which is impressive. Overall, a good, fundamental class, but really hard. Find some friends to pset with, and go into the exams with perspective.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have an intense interest in thermodynamics. If you're taking it you most likely have to anyways, so learn to enjoy it and everything will be easier.",
    "A great course overall. If you're reading this, you probably have to take this class for your major, so I won't try to convince you to take it. It has been one of my favorite classes in the major though, so fear not. It's tough and you really have to work hard throughout the semester to succeed, but it's not too bad if you keep up. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Gomez is great and super patient during office hours.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you have to take it for your major. The material was often boring to me until the end of the course when the concepts were related to real world applications. The quizzes and tests are tricky and written poorly. I was often lost in lecture which was mostly theory.",
    "This course is hard. Don't take it for fun because there is none to be found here. Take this course when you know you'll be able to put in the time for it because you'll need that time. I know that during my \"thermo-semester\" (as it will forever be known), when people asked me how my week had been going, my answer would almost exclusively depend on how hard the thermo p-set was that week. That is was thermo is.",
    "MENG211 covers the basics of thermodynamics and its applications. This is a very difficult course that I would recommend only if it is required for your major. That being said, I found the material to be very interesting, and despite the difficulty, I do feel that I have learned a lot.",
    "MENG 211, although it could be frustrating with extensive (>12 hour) problem sets and highly theoretical lectures, is an important course that will introduce you with ways to analyze thermodynamic systems. Additionally, Professor Gomez, really is a great professor who cares about his students and is always willing to answer any questions. Most students, if ABET MechE, will be required to take this course regardless. Even if you are not required, I would definitely give this course a chance.",
    "Extremely difficult and not enjoyable. Do not take it unless you have to.",
    "Very interesting, very tough, and a lot of work. However, doable.",
    "Interesting at times but unnecessarily hard (problems weren't challenging but long and required information synthesis and sheet brute force). Not my cup of tea.",
    "This class is hard. There really is no way around it. If you do not have to take it for your major, steer clear. If you have to take it, know it will not play nice with your GPA. Gomez is a pretty good professor, but his tests and quizzes are hard. Stay on top of your studying, do not take anything lightly. It has to happen, so try to make the best of it."
