    "A very very strong introduction to the Novelas ejemplares. I would highly recommend it.",

    "An excellent course on Cervantes' Novelas ejemplares. Excellent professor. If you're interested in Cervantes or in Early Modern Spanish literature, and if you want to have the opportunity to read Cervantes' Novelas with a truly great professor, take this course.",

    "I feel like I have a better handle on Cervantes, although the course is a bit limited in scope. I think I learned how to read with a better eye for detail, but I would not say that it directly contributed to my dissertation or research in terms of the material covered.",
    "This course has deepened my overall knowledge of Cervantes, Golden Age prose fiction, and the intellectual\/cultural\/political context of 16th and 17th century Spain.",
    "This course has helped me gain a better understanding of the breadth of Cervantes' work as well as deepened my knowledge of the history and literature of Early Modern Spain. Given the relevance of Cervantes, I expect this course to contribute to my dissertation research.",
    "It help me because Cevante's is an author that one must know.",
    "It prepares you well for the doctoral exams."
