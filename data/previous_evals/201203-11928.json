    "I definitely would because I learned do much about the language in such a short period of time.",
    "The method used by the Yale French department to teach L1-L2 is really good, and you learn a lot in the first semester, without having to spend lots of time cramming and memorizing new words and vocab into your head like you would have to with other languages or teaching methods. I would really recommend taking French at Yale if you're interested. That said, like all L1-L2 classes, the workload is VERY heavy and will consume a lot of your time. That said, if you love learning languages and want to learn French, Yale is going to be one of the best places to learn the language.",
    "French 110 is definitely a fast-paced class, with weekly tests and ground being covered quite quickly. It's good in that you learn to speak a considerable amount of French in only a semester, and the large amount of practices certainly helps. The weekly 'presentations', in which new material is presented in a larger lecture-like format, were weaker: the material tends to get rather boring when you don't fully understand it and don't completely follow what the teacher is saying.Vysosias is a pretty decent teacher, who's really quite accepting and patient with people who take ages to form a comprehensible statement in French.",
    "French 110 is a great course! You end up learning an immense amount of French in just one semester. To do well and keep up with the material, you need to work for an hour or more every day, but the work is very enjoyable. Classes are small, which makes them more personal and fun, and if you want to learn a very valuable new skill such as the French language, you will enjoy doing the work for the course.",
    "You really feel you can chat in French after only one semester. But the weekly tests are a bomb.",
    "French 110 is very rigorous, and you will spend a lot of time working on it, but you will learn French very quickly in the process. If you are willing to deal with the workload, then this is the class for you.",
    "This was a great class, I would definitely recommend it! By the end of the class you learn a lot of french and can understand even more than you know. But, be prepared for a lot of work. Every night you have at least 30-1:30 minutes of homework. But, as long as you get into a routine, it isn't too overwhelming, and doing the work on time definitely helps with the tests.",
    "If you love French and don't mind spending a lot of time on it, then take it! Although there is a lot of work, it's not terribly hard work. For example, I found myself procrastinating on work for harder classes by working on French.",
    "French 110 is a solid introduction to french. I've taken spanish at Yale as well and must admit the french department is definitly superior due to the Capretz Method which, in my opinion, is excellent and very effective. Rather than learning a bunch of vocabulary but being unable to acutally structure a sentence, the method teaches you practical french and builds your confidence so that you feel comfortable speaking right away. However, the rumors are definitely true: french is A LOT of work: homework every night, class every day, and compositions and a test every week. However, if you want to learn french it is worth it and very rewarding. DO read the evaluations and make sure you get a good professor though. Make sure to pre-register beacause the best professors go fast."
