    "See above answer. This is a class about modern Iran taught in Persian. If you study anything to do with Iran, you should probably take it. If not, well, you won't have the skills, so don't bother.",

    "This course contributed greatly to the development of my future research because it covered a wide rang of primary source material that is essential to any project of 19th or 20th century Iran."
