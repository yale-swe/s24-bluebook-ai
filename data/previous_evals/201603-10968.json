    "I learned a lot about China and the challenges they face today from a less biased perspective than I usually hear about things in the news.",
    "The Next China taught me a mixture of Chinese history, principles of economic growth, and international relations. I now know how to evaluate a country's economic trajectory, and have a greater understanding of the codependency between China and the United States. I feel very knowledgeable about a nation that I previously knew very little about.",
    "None.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of China, and how it became the nation that it is today. We covered very relevant topics, and I now feel as though I can speak eloquently about China and its economic issues.",
    "It's a really informative and insightful class. I learned how to view China issues from global mindset and it's really fresh for me to look at the history of China from western education point of view.",
    "Good intro to China, especially economically and less so politically, but fairly biased towards professor Roach's opinion (though he did acknowledge this), and got repetitive.",
    "Need to know some general theories of macroeconomics, and be in touch with the news.",
    "Actual learned a lot about China and found many of elements of the class very intriguing. It's crazy how different of a world China is compared to the US and it is interesting to learn about our role in it.",
    "Super interesting class about China. Learned about China's history, its economic path and way forward for China.",
    "This course presented a wealth of valuable information regarding the current state of the Chinese economy and its relationship with the US. The material required for this course definitely improved my economic literacy as well as taught me to think critically about the economy and evaluate its broader cultural implications.",
    "This has been my first economics course in four years, and I loved it. There was a super long final paper, but it left me with a sense of pride in addition to the regular old exhaustion. I really appreciated the many different variables that we considered in our discussions on the Chinese economy.",
    "By taking this course, I learned more about China's role in the world economy, and how this role may shift in coming years.",
    "If you've been following the news (specifically international markets\/trade\/economic policy) at all, you might be aware of the importance of China's economy. Do yourself a favor and take this course. It'll inform you. It'll contextualize the importance of China's economic transition from a producer economy into that of a more consumer driven economy, and it'll make sure that you understand why the U.S. should be wary of its current dependence on China's economy. I'm super happy that I decided to take this course. I feel that I am now a better informed citizen.",
    "!A: excellent econ elective and primer on china and international finance\/development. EXAMS MUST BE CHANGED. Pick 4 out of 5 essay questions is lazy and unnecessary. Does NOT differentiate between students who did the reading and studied key facts and those who did not. EXAMS must have multiple choice: easy to grade for graders and that way we actually have more efficiently distributed grades. The grading on essays is ARTIBRARY as usual and feedback is nonexistent from the TAs. I was very disappointed with the feedback\/section\/grading aspect of this course, even though I LOVED the material of the lectures and thought it was useful. THE LECTURES: I think a reshuffling for next year is necessary. Dedicate maybe 2-3 lectures at the end of the course on CURRENT trumponomics and china issues as well as KEY policy, tech regulation, and meetings that are happening NOW instead of inserting a slide at the beginning of each lecture like this semester. The material before the first half of the course should focus solely on history instead of going into the labor-saving growth, the imperative to transition, services, total factor productivity, etc. Then make the latter half of the course on the 12\/13th plans, topical issues such as corruption, aging, environment, AND then the current trump issues. This would be the best format and IDEAL for what people want. Fix grading, exam format, and sectionor make section optional if you arent going to change it. Its a waste.",
    "This course was a great overview of China's current economy. It takes a look at China's past, present and future, and does a good job meshing China's politics and current events, with its current economic activity. After taking this course, my understanding of China's current society increased. It's macro-economy is a good framework at evaluating many of its society-based problems. It has increased my interest in Chinese society and culture as well.",
    "I learned an immense amount about he Chinese economy with relation to the US. Loved it.",
    "I learned a great deal about East Asian economies and how economies throughout the world are intertwined. I was able to apply principles learned in Macro to a lot of the concepts we discussed in class.",
    "I learned of the impending problems in Chinese Economics and the co-dependency of the United States and China. How to solve these problems also addressed.",
    "Learned to reason about Chinese economic history",
    "I really liked the research paper aspect of this class. It taught me how to do research and plan out a long project. I plan on using the skills in the senior thesis next year.",
    "I learned about how China's past has and will affect its future. I learned of the problems China is facing, how they can fix them, and if they don't the impact it will have on the global economy.",
    "A brief yet broad introduction to China, especially the economic and political aspect. Recommended for students interested in China but don't have much prior knowledge.",
    "Vast amount of information on China economy, politics, and Chinese society in general.",
    "I learned much more about the Economic planning and policies of China. The course provided an interesting overview of China's development, and Professor Roach made the class even more useful because he is so well connected and knowledgable about the subject and therefore was able to give current updates throughout the semester.",
    "The course provided a very interesting analysis on China's economy, but the professor and lectures started to get repetitive towards the end of the semester.",
    "An overview of the history and future trajectory of the Chinese economy",
    "Great overview of the current economic situation in China.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount in this class. I now have an in-depth understanding about China's economic history and current conditions, and a foundation upon which to make evaluations about its performance in the future. I feel so much more informed than I was before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures were very good, but maybe could have been a bit less redundant in the beginning of the semester. Discussion sections were completely useless. I think doing student presentations during discussion sections wasn't helpful for learning the class material because we never had time to discuss anything that we learned from class or the readings, and I think discussing the readings in class would have been more productive.",
    "Strengths: Professor Roach uses a clear structure for the course, has useful readings, and incorporates current issues (often from newspapers the day before) to construct a meaningful and informative class. Weaknesses: The lectures can feel very drawn out and a little too reliant on the slides. I DO NOT feel like the midterm was graded fairly. Someone who never went to class got a perfect score on the midterm, while I went to every class and did all the reading and received a lower score. I don't think we are given the tools to write a 15-page paper. The grading also takes too long. I also thought section participation was weighted too greatly on the presentation, which I didn't realize until the end of the class. I wish there was more incentive to attend class immediately after the midterm.",
    "The course was a rather tedious and very large lecture. Most of the class was very repetitive and not engaging.",
    "Strengths: Interesting, relevant information; An engaging, knowledgeable professor. Weaknesses: Tough grading.",
    "I like how the class is organized with historical review and current issues discussion. The only thing to improve is adding more discussion or interaction with students during the class. Also it would be better to have Professor or guest speaker to join our discussion section.",
    "Good intro to China, especially economically and less so politically, but fairly biased towards professor Roach's opinion (though he did acknowledge this), and got repetitive.",
    "Very well structured, not much to change given the course's objectives.",
    "Strengths: very interesting content Weakness: 1) It is hard to gauge the extent of one's knowledge of the course material as the course proceeds. I would introduce something like weekly quizzes. 2) Although TA's are impartial, the same paper or midterm could get a different score depending on the TA it was randomly assigned to. The difference could be as much as a letter grade.",
    "Great discussion of what is and has been happening in China.",
    "Strengths: - Professor Roach's lectures are very engaging and interesting. Even though you cannot do all the reading assignments, you can benefit a lot from his lectures. - Lecture slides are very resourceful.",
    "This course was very well organized and insightful. I enjoyed the material in lecture and appreciated how even the most specific topics were seamlessly incorporated into the bigger picture. Section was also quite helpful.",
    "More guidance on writing the final paper would be appreciated. Other than that, this class was well organized for easy learning.",
    "Professor Roach is an expert in this field, and he therefore presents a compelling and complete view of his vision of \"the Next China\" in this course. I think that the IMF guest lecturer also strengthened the course, as he presented a somewhat different perspective than Professor Roach. The lecture slides for the course are very helpful and clear. I believe that the major weakness of the course was its sometimes repetitive nature, and I would suggest that the course could be combined with another topic in order to mitigate some of the repetitiveness of the lectures. Another weakness of the course was the lack of feedback on the final paper. Because the final paper is due so early in the semester, it would be nice to know our grade on the paper before the final exam.",

    "The combination of both politics and economics was a great strength of this course. I appreciated the use of politics as case studies for China's macro-economics. I also enjoyed the framework of this course as it comprehensively broke down China's past, present and future economies, as well as major obstacles in its aspiring economic transition. One suggestion for improvement, however, is that Roach's takeaway eventually becomes repetitive with every lecture.",
    "The course was phenomenal overall but can seem a bit repititive at some times. However, that may just be the nature of he subject.",
    "This course was really enjoyable overall. One thing that could have been expanded on is some of the themes that were discussed in the course since there were some overarching themes that were revisited almost every lecture. However, these themes were very important.",
    "Roach is very very knowledgeable and the course matter is very relevant.",
    "Lectures can get repetitive, but good content and fabulous readings. It is unacceptable that paper grades are not given to us by the end of term and that we receive no feedback about them. The fact that midterm and final essays are graded based on whether a specific correct set of points were mentioned is also silly. They should be graded holistically. I received 0 feedback during the entire course",
    "I thought the class was really interesting, but, sometimes, it felt a little repetitive. Once you understood the model all of the answers seemed to be kind of the same.",
    "I think it was a great class. The grading may have been a little harsh, we'll see. My TA was tough, but I ultimately learned a lot.",
    "Professor Roach is clearly a leading expert on Chinese economy. The structure of the course was very clear and organized. It's a comprehensive overview of Chinese economy, politics, and society. That said, the lectures were not particularly engaging.",
    "The class gave a good overview of Chinese development, Professor Roach presented the material in an organized and helpful manner, and tests were fair. I also really enjoyed our guest speaker. The way the midterm was graded could definitely use improvement - I had no idea where or why I missed points, and my TF did not grade it and could not decipher why I did in certain cases either. Even just a brief note on why points were taken off would be helpful to improve understanding of the content and where I was misunderstanding or misinterpreting what I learned. I would also have appreciated getting my final paper back with feedback.",
    "The topics are interesting but the information gets repetitive. Also what students are expected to know for the midterm and final is not very clear.",
    "It would function better as a seminar given that most people stopped attending the lectures as they realized all the content was provided through the slides",
    "Lectures were quite boring but the material\/readings were really interesting if you are interested in studying China.",
    "The course content is great, lecture is interesting and generally feels like we're learning useful economics that's applicable to the \"real world\". Professor Roach is very interested, seasoned and incredibly knowledgable teacher, but really boring. More guest lectures by dynamic people could be helpful.",
    "This course is strong pretty much all around. The lectures are wonderful. They create a logical and helpful framework that allows you to conceptualize all of the important material of the course. The readings are also good, although there is literally no way to read them all. There is a good balance between exams, a paper, and section."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course as a good class to take credit-d because the lectures are interesting and it isn't too much work week to week except when you are working on the paper. However, I felt that the grading was very arbitrary and there wasn't any clear feedback for how I was doing in the class, which I found frustrating.",
    "I would recommend this course, but I just wish that our own TAs graded our tests and papers, that would make communications much easier.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to expand their knowledge of modern-day China, specifically with respect to economics. None of the material was too complicated to learn. The clear format of the class, along with the fascinating readings, set you up for success.",
    "It's an Econ credit that doesn't require you to complete all the readings. The large paper is not very fun but doable.",
    "Yes! A great, engaging economics class.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend to those students who got high interest at China and suggest to prepare for readings.",
    "Good intro to China, especially economically and less so politically, but fairly biased towards professor Roach's opinion (though he did acknowledge this), and got repetitive.",
    "Yes - China is the future, and anyone interested in knowing how the world might look like 50 years from now should start with China.",
    "If interested in learning more about China and their own current economic issues and resolutions, great class to take.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone that is interested in economics. This is not a class that talks a lot about global politics, but rather (very strictly) global economics. There is a heavy focus on data, but it really is an awesome, engaging class.",
    "Very relevant class. Learn a lot. Good professor!",
    "A great econ class. Take it! Professor Roach's lecture are interesting and engaging. Not a gut class! Fair bit of work! But manageable! Awesome!!!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all economics majors, especially given the current state of the US economy and the global dependence upon China. China serves as an excellent case study of an emerging economy, yet its rich history and political practices keep things interesting. Lectures can be a bit dry, but I was very pleased with the course overall and felt my economic literacy was greatly improved. Take this course if you are interested in learning more about Chinese economy (and global economy, for that matter) on a macroeconomic level.",
    "This is a really great class to learn about macroeconomics with somewhat less bias -- if you're not from China, you're more inclined to examine its inner workings without a blind spot. The workload is acute -- there are readings throughout, but the presentation and paper are huge time sinks, so time management is key if you want to take this course.",
    "If you're interested in the topic, Professor Roach is an expert, and this course is worth taking. It can get repetitive at times, but this is because Professor Roach presents a strong thesis which he supports in numerous ways throughout the course.",
    "A decent course. Shop it and see if you like it. Pretty much what you see is what you get. Not a gut, and I think it got harder this year. Section was not terribly useful because it was student presentations (don't worry, they aren't huge projects). Midterm, final, 15 page paper. The paper was due right before Thanksgiving Break this year, which was brutal, so get started early. Professor Roach loves graphs, probably more than anything in the world. The exam questions are not screwballs. They're just designed to get you to elucidate on the main simple themes of the course. I liked that Professor Roach would start each class with a slide on current events. Very nice.",
    "Yes!",

    "I would recommend this course to students who are genuinely interested in learning about China's current economy. I would say, however, that a good foundation of macroeconomics and a decent understanding of Chinese society\/culture\/history is needed to fully understand the course, and to truly learn something about the course. The workload isn't bad (though it gets pretty heavy towards the end of the semester), and each lecture is truly interesting. It combines China's political and social situations with macroeconomics, making it a comprehensive course on modern China. Roach is a great professor who knows a lot about this subject, and it shows with his lectures. The TFs are amazing, as well!",
    "Yes, I knew nothing about China going into the class and now feel like I have an extremely good understanding of The Chinese economy and its future.",
    "Yes, I would! The subject matter is fascinating and applicable to current events, and it fit well into the presidential election.",
    "Yes!",
    "Roach is dope, lectures can get repetitive, you will receive no indiciation about your grade or standing the entire semester, though. No need to show up to class or even really do the readings. Sections are mandatory and drag on. All negatives aside though, it's a chill class and if you do the readings or show up at all, you'll learn a lot about China. Great econ credit with a low workload if you can stomach the lack of feedback",
    "This is a great class. It has really helped me understand China's place in the world right now and going forward. I think that anyone with even a cursory interest in global affairs of any kind should take this class!",
    "Yes, take this course. Not too time consuming but you can learn a lot of very valuable information about China's future and its impact on the global economy as a whole.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student, especially those interested in China. The course is really comprehensive, and you get to learn it from a real expert.",
    "This is a very well-taught class--Roach knows his stuff, and has tons of interesting things to say about China. Excellent class, especially for people interested in economics but not too fond of math. It felt like I was finally applying some of the things I'd learned in micro and macro to read-world problems. Not much work, readings aren't strictly necessary, and exams are straightforward. Since the research paper is on anything you like, it's quite interesting. Would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in China itself or anyone who will be working\/thinking globally after college (which is probably most people). China has a huge influence on the US and the rest of the world, and it is important to understand how the country is operating. This course will give a good overview of China's Economic development decisions and will touch on policy and political leaders.",
    "This would be a good course to take as credit\/d.",
    "Interesting overview of China's economy. Low workload and lectures aren't highly attended, but the 15 page paper is a lot of work. Good econ elective",
    "Not a gut!",
    "Definitely take this class with Professor Roach if you get the chance and are interested in China! And sign up for the section with Andrea Chen as the TF!",
    "Great as an econ elective,also for anyone interested in learning about the economic-political climate in China. The course content is great, lecture is interesting and generally feels like we're learning useful economics that's applicable to the \"real world\". Professor Roach is very interested, seasoned and incredibly knowledgable teacher, but really boring.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. China is going to be extremely important to the world order for the rest of our lives, and a class like this that gives you an understanding of its economics, history, politics, and potential future issues\/positions is absolutely invaluable. Professor Roach is so informed and qualified, and you will be very glad to have taken his course. I feel so much more informed about so many things that are so important - definitely worth your time."
