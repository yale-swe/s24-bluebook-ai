    "Would definitely recommend. Interesting, thoughtfully put together class.",
    "Easy class. Taking it Credit\/D\/Fail is a breeze. But for your sake, please invest at least a little bit of time and thought into the course. The topics are ones that are so relevant today and will really make you a well knowledge individual. Also, go to lecture. Professor Latham is one of those professors that really does try to help students understand the topics of the course. Amazing class, must take. Midterm is also very easy, but depending on your TA you could get graded a little harsher or even more leniently.",
    "Recommended. Think thoughts.",
    "As a senior who was ready to leave yale second semester, I took this class credit\/d, but have enjoyed it so much tha tI am actually doing really well in the class. When a class like this keeps you so engaged, it is hard not to have fun and want to learn more.",
    "The issues we discussed in this class are important for everyone to know in today's world. I would recommend this class to every Yale student. It's engaging and the material is relevant.",
    "Yes. Low work, awesome material.",
    "If you're even vaguely interested in medicine, take bioethics 100%. This class is amazing and very interesting and very well-taught. Even the readings are super interesting, because it's from a casebook and there's a good deal of drama involved with the cases, and I never do my readings but I did them all for this class. You can get the book in a PDF form online for cheaper than the paper version, and it's easier in my opinion that way to just read in the evenings. Tests are fair and grading is fair (though depends on your TF). Not much in way of assignments... just a reading response, two essay midterms, and one essay final exam. One of my top 3 classes at Yale.",
    "Fascinating lectures, although towards the end Latham starts discussing public health and global health, and it's evident that's not his strong suit (if you want something amazing along those lines take Health of the Public or Intro to Global Health). The only work was 2 midterms which could be studied for the day of.",
    "A fantastic course! Essentially an overview of the legal grounding of various issues in modern bioethics such as withdrawal of life support, abortion, assisted reproduction, public health, human subjects research, organ donation, physician-assisted suicide, among others. The format is lecture style with a mandatory section, and the grading is simply two midterms and a final. (The midterms have two essay questions each, and the final has four.) This is a great class to take if you want to know more about the ethical questions surrounding medicine, and as such in my opinion is an important class for premeds to take. Also, it's pretty easy, so don't fret too much about your grade. The exam questions are pretty standard and essentially cover the main points that you'll find in your notes (and no reading IDs!!) so it doesn't take too much effort to do well. Latham is awesome, and seems to know the answer to every single question asked by any student. Ultimately, you'll leave this course shocked at how much you feel you have learned about bioethics and yet wondering why you still don't have an answer to a single one of the issues presented.",
    "Definitely recommend. Take it take it.",
    "Find someone who takes really good notes if you are not going to go to lecture. An A- trap for those who think they can get away with not putting any effort in. Interesting subject material, easy to follow. Important issues. Great lecturer. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Dope. Take it.",
    "Absolutely. It was a fantastic course full of very relevant and very interesting material",
    "Bioethics and Law is a very interesting course -- highly recommend!",
    "I recommend this course to people interested in Law without any knowledge of law itself.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE!!",
    "Love this class! The amount of reading is totally not reasonable for students to actually complete - the book you're supposed to buy is MASSIVE. That said, I didn't do any of the reading (didn't even purchase the book) and still felt prepared for all the exams because I pay attention in lecture and take good notes. The subject matter is fascinating, and Prof. Latham is an awesome lecturer. Very glad I took the course. I LOVED going to lecture, and the one time I had to miss class I was really upset about it.",
    "Absolutely!!! I know many people discuss this class as a gut, but that should not be a reflection on the quality of teaching. I'm convinced that people often do so well in the class because Latham is incredibly engaging and clear, certainly not because the material itself is easy.",
    "This is a great class, and Prof. Latham is so engaging. I would highly recommend it, regardless of major since the exams are also very fair and straightforward. The textbook is also not necessary reading, so there is not much work.",
    "SO INTERESTING. This would be a great fifth class for any student. Very pertinent issues that anyone (not just future lawyers and doctors) should be well versed in. Professor Latham is one of the best lecturers I've every had at Yale. TA's can be hit-or-miss though.",
    "a good introductory course to bioethics i'd recommend to others",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "I definitely think it is a class that one should try and take before leaving Yale. It's really interesting for pre-meds and non-premeds alike.",
    "\"Bioethics & Law\" is a fun, enjoyable lecture class with a pretty light workload. Of course if you don't keep up with the reading or if you miss a lot of class, it starts to feel boring and tedious because you won't know what's going on and won't be able to form opinions and engage with the material. You'll get a lot out of bioethics, and you'll learn a ton from Professor Latham, if you're ready to take this class seriously. Otherwise, it can still be an easy fifth class to round-out your semester, but it will become one of those boring, tedious gut classes.",
    "Very interesting class that is unlike any other course at Yale. I would especially recommend this class to science majors or pre-med students who want to learn more about the current legal issues in the scientific world, or the history of some of the current laws. Very easy for the amount of information you learn. Just 2 midterms and a final and a short non-graded assignment before each section. However, a lot depends on your TA and how harsh they are with grading the exams.",
    "Fun class, not too much work but very enjoyable. The subject material is super interesting, and while all the readings aren't required, they're also quite interesting. You get what you put into this class, and if you put in a lot, you learn a lot at the end.",
    "Take this, especially if you are pre-med and looking for a class that is outside your comfort zone, but also in your topic of interest",
    "Very interesting class, if you have any interest in science-y things and are looking for another class to take, I highly recommend it. Taking the class credit-D requires doing none of the reading - I expect I'll have a B+\/A- and didn't try hard. Easy material - two midterms and a final, no papers to write. Latham is an amazing lecturer. He keeps it interesting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! If you can only take one more elective, just for fun class in your entire Yale career, make it this one. It's relevant, it's interesting, and it's easy to do well if you actually put in the work and show up to lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It is so interesting and it's not too challenging or time-consuming. It really gets you to think about a bunch of important issues.",
    "Chill course, take it CR\/D though!",
    "Take this but make sure you get the right TA",
    "always prepared with answers and was the greatest grader ever",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Very easy work load, and very rewarding. You'll learn a lot, and enjoy the class along the way!",
    "Take it!! You'll learn a lot and it's not hard at all.",
    "Definitely take this class! You learn so much about the healthcare system, but it's not a struggle.",
    "Bioethics is a very interesting medical and law class! Even though there wasn't a lot of work, the class is super interesting making one want to read the readings and go to class. Recommend taking for more than just an \"easyish\" grade.",
    "Phenomenal credit D class. Interesting class that covers broad issues in bioethics (abortion, organ transplantation, surrogacy, etc.) in a very accessible and engaging way.",
    "Great lecture and pretty easy, but WARNING: grading is entirely arbitrary depending on your TA, and it's a 'gut' that gives most people B+\/A- grades. Possibly good to take credit\/D",
    "Great, interesting class. If you go to class and participate in section you will understand the topics and want to learn more about them.",
    "Recommending it to all my friends! A must at Yale!",
    "You should take this class AND go to lecture. The topics are fascinating and Latham is one of the most engaging lecturers at Yale.",
    "This is a good class. Professor Latham is a very good lecturer. The subject material is genuinely interesting and relevant to our lives. The work load is light: two midterms and a final, along with a super brief less than one page response to a question before section. The section responses were only graded on completion, not content, and you were allowed to skip two. If you are interested in the material then definitely take the class.",
    "Bioethics and Law provides you with fundamental knowledge that will help you better understand US healthcare and law. It gets you up to date on current medical issues, and helps you understanding the history behind decisive court cases and public opinion.",
    "If you like law, good job. It's heavy on law, not so much on bioethics, and the readings don't really make it a gut if you're willing to read law texts.",
    "Would highly recommend! Latham is a great lecturere and keeps the material interesting. Taking this course made me a more well-informed person about many issues in public health, end of life care, abortion, etc. Take this course if you want to learn about a broad range of topics in bioethics and if you want to see how the law reasons (for a person with no political science background, this course was eye-opening). The weekly workload for the course is rather minimal, but studying for exams is a time intensive process.",
    "Great credit D class for a heavy semester. General survey of the main cases and concepts important to bioethics.",
    "YES TAKE IT",
    "Great course. Would definitely recommend.",
    "PLSC 257 is an engaging course about the law and American bioethics (topics such as abortion, embryonic cell research, health care, etc). I think almost anyone can enjoy this class, even if they're not a \"political science\" person -- its about interesting topics that affect us all. Professor Latham is a wonderful lecturer and section was always interesting! I would definitely recommend!",
    "Bioethics and Law is great. Take it. It's a perfect fifth class, and it's information that every American citizen should be aware of. The material is interesting, Latham is great, and the exams are fair.",
    "Worth it if you're at all interested in bioethics or just need an so credit",
    "The size of this class really shapes its dynamics. The grade is only determined by two midterms and a final, and they are all predictable and straight forward. Even if this format is a bit boring, I found the course material very interesting, and I would recommend this class to others.",
    "Great course. You can learn a ton if you try hard enough. Latham is cool, but definitely shop the TFs for the course. It can drastically change your experience, so pick someone whose style you prefer.",
    "This is an interesting course taught by a great professor, with the added bonus of a low workload (two midterms, short weekly responses, and a final). I highly recommend it!",
    "definitely a good class to take",
    "This is an amazing course-- I was hooked from day 1. Latham is an amazing lecturer and he knows what he's talking about. It doesn't require much work, but if you want to do well--read the book. It's an easy A- and hard A. It's a little lacking in structure in terms of grading. Sections are taught soooo differently it's kind of ridiculous. And TAs grade very very differently. I would've appreciated more standardness across the course. You could get lucky or screwed over very easily.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. Not only is it interesting, but it's also very little work, meaning you can actually enjoy lecture since you won't have pestering assignments in the back of your mind. Definitely a class everyone should take at some point.",
    "The class is very interesting. Latham is an awesome lecturer. There is virtually no work, but the midterms are graded kind of strictly. Would recommend to anyone in any major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for the material. Super interesting, and Professor Latham is an excellent lecturer.",
    "It's a great course. I think everyone should take it. You not only learn about important issues in bioethics, but you also gain at least a broad understanding of the American legal and health systems, which is fundamental knowledge that everyone should have. I took it credit\/d as a second semester senior--beyond showing up for lecture and section and memorizing a few cases for the exams, you don't have to do much if you're not taking it for a grade.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE. Great class for people with interest in political science or medicine or biology or human rights in general.",
    "Amazing take it please! Best class I've taken at Yale. Doesn't even feel like a class it's so fun and interesting.",
    "This class was interesting and fairly easy. The topics discussed are relevant to healthcare in modern society. Latham is a great lecturer. Section was boring. 2 midterms and a final - all writing with no surprises.",
    "A bit disorganized but really interesting if you have some curiosity about the realm of bioethics and how law regulates that.",
    "I would recommend this course, the topics are very interesting and the professor is really engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 257 to another student, regardless of year or major. Everyone should know about some of the most controversial bioethics cases, such as organ transplant\/physician assisted suicide\/abortion rights\/etc. If anything, the class will teach you how to think and opine. I really enjoyed this class, which overall wasn't a lot of work - there are two midterms, one final, and discussion questions to answer prior to section each week (the latter depends on the section).",
    "Absolutely a must-take course!!!!",
    "A good undergraduate law class. Take it if you care more about 'law' than a discussion of 'ethics'. Everyone who wants to take this class will get a place, resulting in a huge class size. The lectures are captivating, and at three exams, the workload is very reasonable.",
    "A great 5th class, but definitely take it Credit\/D if you don't have time to commit to studying for it. The grading among the TF's is extremely variable.",
    "I would describe it as a very heavily focused on law take of bioethics and would recommend it to another student. I would say that the grading is pretty dependent on what TA you have and that it's a lot less bioethics than I had expected.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I recommend it! It is minimal work (short weekly reading responses, midterm and final) and the lectures are interesting.",
    "Bioethics and Law is a huge lecture class (over 500 students). I get the sense that this class gets over-hyped, similar to Intro Psych. Some of the lectures were a bit uninspiring and provided only a superficial overview. The workload was very light (two midterms, one final). The supplementary readings, especially the court cases in the Bioethics and Public Health Law Textbook, were completely unnecessary as the exams only called for a very superficial understanding of the cases. Discussion section was mandatory, which was a bit of a pain. Also, the midterms were graded very harshly. I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about US health systems and bioethics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students because I believe everyone could use some knowledge on the health legal system in the U.S..",
    "Great, interesting, relevant class that doesn't have a lot of work",
    "FANTASTIC course. Everyone should take this course, it is manageable, easy, and if you take good notes and actually come to the phenomenal lectures you will get an A. I took this course as an extra fifth class and I'm so glad that I did because it had some of the most interesting and engaging material that I've ever studied. The class is massive and this is perhaps its biggest weakness because there are some students that are super into the course and others that are asleep and totally absent during lectures. Latham does a great job of engaging the class and making the lectures a great part of my day, but it would be even better if this material could be delivered in a way that wasn't a massive lecture. Nonetheless the lectures were amazing and if you took good notes and paid attention there was no need to do the readings and you could still ace the midterms and final. I loved this course and I wish there were more like it I could take.",
    "Good intro course with interesting legal cases.",
    "It's great.",
    "Yes-good course and not hard. Pretty basic stuff, but very relevant and interesting.",
    "An extremely interesting and necessary course. The grading can seem arbitrary and questionable, but no matter what you will learn a ton.",
    "A good course: very interesting and engaging with a lot of cool and relevant material.",
    "Loved this course, showed me that I want to work in public health in the future.",
    "Super interesting and entertaining course. Professor Latham is awesome and the tests aren't too bad if you pay attention. Text book is also very interesting and a fun read. Take it for a great social science credit.",
    "Really good course - don't be confused though. It's not exactly a gut - you have to work hard to get a good grade. The workload isn't' too extensive, but getting an A is not easy. Extremely interesting, even if you don't need it for a major or a requirement - definitely recommend it.",
    "Great lectures.",
    "A class that is definitely worth taking. As a second-semester senior, I took the course Credit\/D. However, the material was so interesting and so well presented in lecture and section that I paid attention and opted to do the readings. I ended up doing far better than I needed to because the course material and the instructors (Professor Stephen Latham and my TA Andrew Walchuk) were so engaging.",
    "Take the class. The lectures are great and the workload is low. Latham is also a phenomenal professor.",
    "This class goes into the details and history of many bioethics and law issues. Sort of helped me to form educated opinions about certain things presented in this class. Not a very difficult class. but I actually retained a lot of info and and basic understanding of the constitution in law pertaining to bioethical issues. Prof. Latham is a great lecturer and makes every class interesting somehow.",
    "Highly recommend the class, fair exams and interesting topics.",
    "Very applicable and interesting",
    "Aaaand I thought I would like this class. The workload is certainly low, and I didn't go to half of the lectures (I took it Cr\/D). It was super easy to scrape up a passing grade without any work. However, sections were a complete waste of time and I found that this course was way too \"law-heavy\"--I didn't learn enough about BIOETHICS, since everything was just court cases. Would have been better with more ethical discussions, and more of a focus on ETHICS in general, since the course felt so hard and dry like every other Poly Sci class.",
    "I'd highly recommend the class to any student, but especially to STEM kids because the topics covered are very engaging if you like science.",
    "This is a great class. I took it as an extra credit and really enjoyed it.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in the course material.",
    "Bioethics and Law is one of the must-take classes at Yale. It is a huge class, and it is most definitely worth it. Professor Latham is an excellent professor and his stories are entertaining. The material of the class is fascinating. As a science major, I liked having this class to look at some science-based issues from a different perspective. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if it is not in your major. It's an incredibly manageable course that really makes you think after each lecture.",
    "I highly recommend the class. It can be interesting for anyone interested in law, public health, medicine, research, or bioethics of course. The class is not a lot of work, and the lectures were always enjoyable to listen to.",
    "I would absolutely recommend PLSC 257 to nearly anyone, regardless of previous experience or interest in law. This course conveys highly important material in a very engaging way and is taught by an excellent professor and a great group of TFs. Especially for students new to the subject matter (as I was), this course encourages a different sort of problem solving and will definitely deepen your understanding of our current medical and political systems. It is certainly worth your time to take this class.",
    "Bioethics and Law is an interesting course that is applicable to all students regardless of major. The course covers several current topics-- abortion, physician assisted suicide, end of life care, refusing life-saving treatment, etc.-- and focuses on how U.S. state and federal law has developed around those topics. The lectures are incredibly engaging, and professor Latham specifically mentions all the cases you need to know in lecture. Therefore, the reading isn't necessarily mandatory so long as you look up the case briefs and details of the cases mentioned in lecture. This was a manageable 5th class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Easy workload, but not too gutty because the material is fascinating, super applicable to real life, and the prof is also incredible. I almost didn't take it, then shopped it the second day and decided there was no way I couldn't not take this course. DO IT DO IT DO IT",
    "Pretty simple class. Material is easy to understand and also pretty interesting.",
    "Bioethics and Law is an excellent course. Looking for an easy 5th class? Eager for a bit of exposure into law? Interested in being informed about some of the most contentious issues that America still grapples with? Take this class. Latham is a great professor and lecturer. Definitely recommend!",
    "A must take at Yale.",
    "This is an amazing class. The workload is low and the topics are really interesting. Take it for a fun social science credit.",
    "Bioethics and law is the perfect class for C\/D\/F. If you're taking it for a letter grade, you will probably get an A-. Take it pass fail!",
    "I would recommend it, Bioethics and Law teaches you about a variety of bioethics issues that are very important, whether you are a polysci major, a biotech student or an aspiring doctor. The topics are very interesting.",
    "This is a must take course. You not only learn about the legal and moral dilemmas of the medical field and learn about interesting cases, but you get to see how often the medical field is applied to your life.",
    "Great course. Prof. Latham is a fantastic lecturer and I always felt enthralled by the material as he taught it. Other than the lectures, which are a reason to take the course in and of themselves, this was not a great course. My TA was very bad and we had to submit weekly questions on the readings that were never even discussed in section. Plus, there was no grade for section so it felt pointless going. I'd recommend auditing it or credit D.",
    "Bioethics is a fabulous course to take!! This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. I thought the information was interesting, lecture and section were engaging, and overall it wasn't so much information that I felt like I couldn't learn it all. I left the class with a better understanding of Bioethics and how the law works, and I'm so glad I took the class. It's a great class to take regardless, but could also fit into a five class schedule. Professor Latham is great!",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend the class--though perhaps as a Credit\/D. Not too much work and interesting lectures and section discussions.",
    "It's a really informative course. Because bioethics is a pretty specialized field, this class makes you question and grapple with moral questions you might not have encountered before.",
    "A great class to learn about the law, issues that we will face in the future in bioethics, and to develop the proper mindset hink critically about ethical and moral debates.",
    "Definitely take it if you can. The class incredibly engaging and clearly applicable regardless of major.",
    "I already recommended this class to other students.",
    "I took this class because I thought it would not be too hard, because health care in the US is hella confusing and I wanted to begin to understand it, and because I wanted an introduction to thinking about things through a legal lens, which can be useful. It totally met all these expectations, and in addition lecture was quite interesting and the information was immediately useful. The worst part is section. Unfortunately, too many people take the class because its easy, and so there are a lot of people who don't care at all, and so nobody really wants to talk during section, and the poor TFs find themselves painfully pulling words from students' mouths.",
    "I walked into this class on a whim, after having scoured the Yale Blue Book for a course that fit in a free time slot. After sitting through one lecture, I was convinced I had to take this course and proceeded to work my schedule around it. Professor Latham is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject, and the topic of bioethics is incredibly fascinating. I was excited to have an actual casebook as our textbook, and often found myself poring over cases and the Notes sections following each case because they were so intriguing. In terms of workload, it's definitely manageable: two midterms and a final. That's it! Section depends heavily on the TA, but mine was great and I had an enjoyable experience so choose wisely.",
    "This is a pretty good class, and I would recommend it if you're looking for 5 classes. The subject is pretty interesting and the workload is not very heavy",
    "This class is fun, you learn a lot, and it's not much work (depending on your TA). The most you'll have is one page a week double spaced; you'll probably have less. Would totally recommend; I took it with a STEM major friend who also loved it.",
    "Great class! A must-take! The material is so important; the class is not too difficult or too much work; and Latham is a very engaging lecturer",
    "Great class you should take",
    "I would strongly recommend PLSC 257 to anyone at Yale looking for an interesting social science credit. The material is extremely interesting. If you are interested at all in philosophy and ethics, then this course can provide some insight into how those are applied in policy; for those interested in policy, it doubles as an exploration of how different ethical systems have shaped our system of bioethics. In addition, Prof. Latham is among the best lecturers that I have had at Yale; his lectures are entertaining and engaging. The workload is also quite light, with just two midterms and a final exam. There are also ungraded discussion section questions and prompts, but these are not too time consuming, and the reading is generally quite interesting. Overall, quite highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend Bioethics. It's a fascinating class. Be aware, though, that choosing a good TA does make a difference, and that the tests are difficult.",
    "Excellent class, absolutely take it",
    "This is where law meets healthcare meets government. It's a really cool class with a great professor, you just ned to be interested in the material and want to make the most out of it.",
    "an introduction course to the realm of bioethics which was taught by an incredible professor and had amazing discussions.",
    "2 midterms, one final, weekly short responses to readings that aren't graded. Each midterm has 2 questions equally weighed and the final has 4 questions. Make sure to take excellent notes. All info comes from lectures for exams!",
    "Each section is required to have a certain distribution so if you have a section where the students work harder you are more likely to have a worse grade. Overall grading is arbitrary. Interesting topics and not too difficult to understand, however grading is a deterrent.",
    "Very interesting class. Easy to engage in. A must take. Interesting topics. Something everyone can relate too but also related to the laws behind it all.",
    "Again, interesting course material but very arbitrary grading.",
    "MUST TAKE! Definitely take this class before you graduate if it is offered. Even if you do not have an interest in political science, this is an amazing introduction to an interesting and growing field. Learning about many of these topics, including organ transplantation and abortion, will make you a more educated person in general and they make for lively discussions in section. Workload is very manageable if you stay on top of assignments. There are weekly discussion responses due to your TF (usually right before section meeting) and they usually consist of questions related to course material\/readings -- you are also allowed two \"skips\" on these responses. Section attendance is mandatory but TF's are pretty flexible about letting you attend another section time if you have a conflict. Readings are assigned out of the textbook and are not necessary to do well in the class, but will make your exam responses stand out if you have additional information to supplement the lecture notes. There are two written midterms and a final, and the questions become more open-ended as the course progresses. However, they are extremely fair and if you put in the time you can definitely come out with an A- or A in the class. I would not say that bioethics is as much of a gut as people go in thinking it is, but if you keep up with the material and GO TO CLASS (pretty much everything you write on exams will come from lecture notes), you will find that it is a light workload and that you won't need to stress about exams.",
    "An awesome class that has great material and a great professor",
    "Super interesting course. Big focus on judicial precedents, so enjoyable for someone interested in the history of bioethics. Light workload and overall a fun course.",
    "Great class, very very interesting.",
    "I learned so much about controversial topics such as the structure of the healthcare system, contraception, abortion, organ donation, embryonic stem cell research, patenting, etc. Bioethics and Law is a class every Yale student should consider, no matter your interests. There's something to learn for everyone.",
    "Yes! It is interesting and not too much work. It would be a fun class to take with your friends.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone at Yale. I learned so much and enjoyed every class.",
    "Good class to take if you want to learn about bioethics or get a feel for a law undergrad course. Not as gutty as you would expect so study hard for the exams.",
    "100% take this course! It isn't too much work but is very interesting.",
    "PLSC 257 is a great class that explores the history of bioethics and law in the United States. Every lecture is amazing and interesting. I would one hundred percent recommend this class to all students even if they are not a political science major or a history major.",
    "A fascinating class with a wonderful professor. I would highly recommend it for anyone at all interested in the field. Fairly light workload and really worthwhile material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The course material is super interesting and I learned a tremendous amount. Applicable to anyone interested in law, ethics, technology, medical issues, and the intersection between them.",
    "Bioethics is a class that everyone at Yale should take. You'll learn lots of relevant, interesting information that everyone should know. Latham is a fantastic lecturer; don't miss the opportunity to take his class. Section provides a format for discussion and debate about the topics covered in class. The readings are essentially optional, though they're all really interesting!",
    "I would recommend this class to any student even if they are not seeking to major in political science.",
    "Exceptionally relevant and engaging information and set of questions that we should think about and discuss more often. Great and digestible deivery of material by Professor Latham. Readings are not necessary, but I wish I had done more of them, as much of the case law assigned was actually super helpful and surprisingly comprehensible. TAs differ in grading harshness, so don't treat this class entirely as a gut because it's not necessarily an easy A.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Good political science class and raises interestin discussions.",
    "The description is self-explanatory, the class is great. Don't take it if you have difficulty following along when there are no slides or anything (Latham just lectures in class, very traditionally) or if you are prone to skipping class (I am and I paid for it on the midterm). That being said Latham is an awesome professor and the topics are incredibly interesting. I absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Yes - definitely take! It's one of those classes that teaches you so much that I'd recommend taking this class before you graduate!",
    "I would recommend PLSC 257 to any student. Even for someone who is not pre-law or pre-med, it is a fabulous class that everyone should take.",
    "Bioethics and Law is a great introduction to the law in the United States behind medicine and public health issues. It is much more of a law class than an ethics class: the professor would occasionally mention how one practice favored one ethical code over another, but the majority of the course talked about how the law works. It focused on court cases but also mentioned regulations from federal agencies and legislation. It is not much work at all, but the grading places a lot of emphasis on the tests (the final was 50% of the total grade). It is a great class for anyone remotely interested in law, medicine, or public health, and it is not too much work at all (you can probably do very well in the course without doing all of the readings). The sections are very helpful at understanding the material.",
    "Great class to learn about the intersection between law and medicine. Interesting topics covered, like assisted suicide, abortion, and organ transplantation. It's a lot of memorization, but it's manageable. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! Super interesting lectures (Professor Latham is awesome) -- I literally never got bored in lecture. It's about controversial topics in health policy and the history behind them. Just a really, really great class and not difficult material-wise at all. I learned so much.",
    "Amazing class!!! The lectures are so interesting and Latham is amazing. Everyone should take this class before leaving Yale. Bioethics affects all of us - debates over abortion, end of life care, organ donation - and I'm so much more informed and interested than I was before taking the course. It also taught me a lot about the legal system in an actually engaging context of healthcare law. I never thought I could sit through a 50 minute lecture on public health systems, but when 50 minutes was up I didn't want to leave. Such an amazing course. However. This class was described to me as \"the guttiest gut.\" That may be true in terms of workload - the readings are completely unnecessary to success in the class - but not in terms of ability to get an A. I would've enjoyed the class much more if I had credit\/D-ed it, since the final exam is worth literally 50% of the grade.",
    "Great class whose material all should be exposed to. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend the course as a 5th credit. You learn about many interesting current topics and are pushed to form your own opinion on many matters that the world is facing. The material learned may be hard to apply to any specific job or major, but you leave the class knowing you learned.",
    "A great class ! Even if you aren't pre-med or pre-law, it's so interesting to know about how our legal and medical systems interact, as well as where medical developments will go in the next few years. Highly recommended",
    "An amazing course! I learned so much about the legal history of the US. You learn why abortion is illegal, where that legal precedent comes from, what's happening right now at the Supreme Court, and where bioethics law could go. Cover topics from stem cell research to public health responses to Ebola. Great course for freshman who need a relatively easy intro to a poli sci or for upperclassmen who need a good course that's pretty easy but you learn a ton!",
    "I would absolutely recommend bioethics and law! What a fantastic course. I learned so much about healthcare and why it is the way that it is. I left the course feeling I had gained knowledge on a very relevant topic that I could use in day to day conversation. Loved it!",
    "An easy lecture based course. I'd recommend to pre-meds or anyone interested in bioethics as long as they were okay with the grading format.",
    "Bioethics is a great way to learn about both the legal and medical systems in the U.S. The court cases you learn about are crazy, Latham is awesome, and all you really NEED to do is focus on the cases he mentions in lecture (reading the textbook is helpful, but you can get away with out doing it). Just 3 examsuhh thank you sir, may I have another.",
    "Good class",
    "It's not a guy but it is a class you can easily get an A in. Just go to lecture and do the occasional reading and you'll be fine. Keep track of the cases and readings, which isn't too hard because most of the material is actually really interesting. If you need a social science definitely sign up to take this.",
    "Must take.",
    "would recommend if you get the chance take it",
    "Its a great course! Steven Latham is an amazing lecturer. Totally would recommend it. Requires almost no work during the week, and you only have to study for two midterms and final. But more than that, the material is incredibly interesting and broadens your realm of thinking.",
    "Overall, the course is a great introduction into bioethics and teaches a lot of important life information, spanning from the US healthcare system to the US public health structure. I learned how to apply constitutional law to contentious health issues and utilize precedents set by past cases to evaluate the constitutionality of different legal decisions.",
    "I would say that this class is an introduction to the very pertinent and contreversial topic of bioethics which is involved in each person's life. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Very informative and applicable class with a manageable workload taught by a great professor. Would recommend it to everyone!",
    "Bioethics and Law is a very interesting course that I would recommend to anyone, regardless of your major. The information is accessible, and presented in a clear way that makes me feel like I will actually remember it. Professor Latham is a fantastic lecturer, the amount of work it not overwhelming at all, and you really learn a lot in this course. I would highly recommend it!",
    "Bioethics is 10\/10 Captivating professor, engaging TA, fascinating material, fair tests - couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable class. I was excited to attend every lecture, and all of my friends who shopped it all stayed. The class was held in the Law School Auditorium, which was always packed. Extremely grateful that I took this class, as it gave me greater awareness of the ethics and the history behind many current events such as medical research, abortion, and assisted suicide."
