    "The classes taught by Maureen were honestly, pretty pointless. The slides she used are ancient and she covered very basic material that is already covered in the intro of the classes that were required pre-reqs for this course. The classes almost need to be eliminated-- they served no useful purpose. Maureen also required that each group meet with her once a week, and again, that was a pretty big waste of time. Maureen is quite nice, but I don't know if she's cut out to teach a class like this. She had little to offer in helping guide us in the enviro-biz consulting world.",
    "Perhaps making all sessions mandatory and having a no-laptop policy would ensure that guest speakers have students' full attention.",
