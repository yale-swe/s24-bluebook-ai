    "Reading and engaging with themes of race, gender, and class in American history at a deeper level than usual survey courses of US history.",
    "I learned how to interpret primary sources that I hadn't in the past. I also learned how to make connections of greater trends in public health over 3 centuries.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of public health in America",
    "I learned a lot about the history of public health and how that affects current policy in the U.S. This country's health-related history also shows us a lot about human nature in general and shows us patterns that emerge over and over again.",
    "I learned a great deal about public health in America.",
    "I learned a lot about recent history and was able to connect many themes about health to broader themes and timelines.",
    "Learned about the history and current practice of public health in america.",
    "I learned how to try to absorb a large amount of information and random facts from scattered and messily labeled powerpoints that are tangentially related to the topic over a short amount of time :-)",
    "In this course I gained an overview of how major historical moments in the past two centuries impacted public health. This course emphasized history more than public health, which I valued because I have taken several courses that focused more on the public health topics.",
    "I learned a lot about different public health interventions and strategies that people have used over the past few centuries.",
    "This course provided a surprisingly in-depth view of major historical public health periods and movements in America. From topics such as smallpox, cholera, and tuberculosis, to movements such as the Civil Rights', feminists', New Left's, and New Right's (just to name a few), we covered a huge (often overwhelming, if you aren't a History major or at least used to history courses at Yale) amount of information. The information was very interesting and worthwhile, but not always presented in the most engaging manor (lectures with powerpoints each class, with only a few additional multimedia pieces).",
    "Was considering an HSHM major and I feel that this class is a good overview of what the history of medicine has to offer; great overview of major health movements and events in American history; also the first history class I've ever taken here at Yale, so it was personally really cool to me to be exposed to primary sources, papers, and discussion sections for a first time in a while",
    "I gained an understanding of the major themes of American public health. The course is truly incredible - Prof. Rogers hits almost every aspect of Public Health in America. I learned about the doctor \/ patient dynamic, racism in Public Health, HIV\/AIDS, healthcare, feminism and women's health, infectious disease, and much, much more. I feel so much better prepared for any discussion about public health or any further academic pursuit in HSHM.",
    "I really enjoyed the content but know how to type fast because Professor Rodgers speaks very quickly",
    "I gained knowledge about the history of public health in the United States. I found the course to be an enlightening HSHM course, which gave a new look at events or people that I previously learned about in other courses.",
    "You learn how to read patterns in history, how to write papers, and how to synthesize mass amounts of information.",
    "memorization, writing, connecting themes and describing in a logical manner",
    "As I embark into more public health-focused courses, this course gave me a great foundation for entering those spaces. I believe that history can have an extreme influence on the present, so I appreciate all that I have learned in this course.",
    "A lot of insight on public health! Loved learning about such a big time period",
    "I learned about the history of medicine and diseases, spanning from the Yellow Fever that swept through colonial American to the HIV\/AIDS in the 1980's and the obesity epidemic of present day. I also learned to write a research paper that explores the interplay of public health and sociopolitical issues.",
    "The course offers a comprehensive overview of the historical changes in diseases in the context of health policies.",
    "I learned about trends in public health over American history with a focus on major epidemics from various time periods.",
    "I got a good background in public health in America."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were pretty well organized (term sheet given to the students for each lecture), most of the readings were quite good. I didn't think the two books were very good, though. I would ditch the books and have more readings in the course packet.",
    "Lectures were interesting, but the slides were not as detailed as I would have liked them to be. Even after going to all lectures, I would go back to the lecture slides and sometimes have holes in my lecture notes that I could not fill simply by the lecture slides.",
    "The balance of work in this course is odd. Most of the grade is determined by the last few weeks of class, which is a difficult distribution. It's hard to have a paper worth 40% of the grade due just a couple of days before the final, especially because these two things make up 2\/3 of the major assignments\/exams of the entire semester.",
    "Very cool material. Wish it would have had a few more lectures on present day issues, but the material overall was interesting.",
    "Interesting course content; professor lectures too fast and always starts before the official class start time. Also, 70% of the grade is determined by the last two assignments (final and final paper), so you have no idea how you're doing in the class. I think the course could be improved by weighting those two less and adding smaller assignments throughout the course (we have none currently).",
    "The course was well taught. Professor Rogers is a great lecturer, and the TFs seemed to put a lot of effort into creating activities for section.",
    "I think this course is somewhat disorganized and the overall themes are hard to parse out.",
    "This course is pretty good. On a petty level, the professor started class early every. single. day. which is obnoxious if you have a class right before it. Secondarily, the class is very very backloaded with work, as the final paper is 40% of the grade, and the final exam is 30%.",
    "The course material was very interesting and engaging. But, 70 percent of my grade was due at the end of the semester, which made it difficult to understand how I was doing in the class. Also, the answers that were expected on the exam were much more involved than any history class I've taken and the timing for the exams was hard. I liked the class but I had a very difficult time figuring out what was expected of me.",
    "I enjoyed lecture. Prof Rogers is a fun lecturer, though can be slightly disorganized in her presentation at times. This class also does not require much work. However, this means your grade is often unknown and you can become easily penalized for small mistakes on one assignment. I also found section uninteresting and poorly run.",
    "Strength: Naomi was an interesting and eccentric lecturer. I enjoyed it. Weakness: Lack of information regarding requirements and messy powerpoints. Topic often weren't connected or connected poorly.",
    "This course emphasized historical context in discussing public health, which I think made it a strong history of science and medicine introductory course. At times the history seemed to drown out the public health, so I think that making a more deliberate effort to tie the history to the public health would improve the course.",
    "The content for this class was interesting. However I think it wasnt taught in a very coherent way, it felt like we were rambling a lot. More succinct curriculum would help",
    "As someone whose first history course at Yale was Public Health in America, I was overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of information covered every day. Professor Rogers stood at the front of a large room and lectured each class - it was often difficult to hear her, as she only turned on the microphone a few times over the course of the semester, and she doesn't speak very loudly. Each lecture was a mad rush to try to hear and type everything Professor Rogers said - there wasn't much time for reflection and contemplation of information (of course, you can do this on your own time, but it would be nice to have some of that during class, too). The pace of the class was just a little too much for me. (Also just a note: the final paper is with 40% of your grade! It's a research paper on any public health topic before the twenty-first century.)",
    "Strengths: good overview of major medical history events which was really good since you got a taste of everything that this field has to offer, not a lot of evaluations (like exams and assignments) which can contribute to a lighter workload but also can be a weakness, my TF was amazing and going to section was very productive and sparked interesting discussion about the themes and topics addressed in class; professors posted terms that were relevant to each PPT which was very helpful in studying for exams Weaknesses: the professor can go through her lecture slides very quickly and sometimes that causes a lot of anxiety and too much focus on getting the material down instead of listening and giving full attention to the material and analysis at hand, guest lectures also were the same way; not a lot of assessments besides a 10-page research paper that counts for 40% of your grade and 2 midterms, and participation (which I feel should be at least 15% since everyone does make an honest effort to participate and involve themselves in discussion section)",
    "The lectures can for sure be more interesting because the content is extremely interesting",
    "The course covered a lot of material and variety of topics. There was something for everyone. I also liked how we would connect ideas from earlier in the course to later on. One weakness of this course could be its organization based on theme rather than chronology, which sometimes made things a bit harder to follow.",
    "It's overall a great course with interesting material taught by an engaging professor. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Terrible disparities in grading between TAs",
    "Lectures were always engaging. I greatly enjoyed section. However, I think having a final 10 page paper and final exam was a lot of work at the end of the year. Additionally, I do not feel like the IDs on the midterm exam were fair (this was improved on in the final exam - there was more of a mix of specific people and events).",
    "The material was very interesting, but the class was organized badly. The lectures were a little discombobulated, and I don't think the assignments were well spaced out.",
    "Strengths are the subject matter Weaknesses are the disorganization. Sometimes I was left wondering, what does this have to do with public health?",
    "The course is very well-organized! There was a rhythm to it every week: 2 classes with lectures, where we got to hear Professor Rogers speak and share her knowledge, and 1 section with a TF.",
    "Strength is that you learn lots of materials. Weakness is that none of the topics is deeply investigated.",
    "Instead of a 50 minute lecture, it should be an hour and 15 minutes! The information provided during lecture is too much and too interesting to be stuffed into 50 minutes! Eliminate section, basically a waste of time.",
    "This class seemed like a standard history class to me with its focus on events and themes. I think that the information was presented in a way that was easy to understand and that the individual topics that we discussed were well-organized. I also appreciate that the slides and term sheets are posted online. I think that the main weakness of the class for me was the tests. Though the IDs were terms that were mentioned in class, sometimes I feel like they were too minor to be explained in detail and\/or that we had not been given enough information about them to give a satisfactory answer. I was also not given any feedback on the midterm (i.e. no comments in the grading about why I had been deducted points). Because many people had the same problem, my TF agreed to meet with us and to help us understand the grading of our midterms if we desired, but I still think that, considering that I seemed to be consistently making a minor mistake, the grader should have left some indication of what was wrong.",
    "Very interesting material, sometimes not always sure how it related to public health."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in public health, take it. Not as gutty as you might think, but also not that hard.",
    "I would recommend this class. The only challenge is getting feedback throughout the course. As it is a very back heavy course, it is difficult to get feedback early on.",
    "Yes! Good survey of American public health, course description is pretty accurate. Primary source reading material can be genuinely very interesting and cool and you will leave with a solid sense of the contemporary public health landscape.",
    "Not too much work",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I learned a lot, and I feel like I'm actually going to remember it in the future. Also, this course has enabled me to make more informed decisions about my political opinions regarding public health issues.",
    "I would recommend taking another history class that is a bit more organized. Also, the final paper lacked a clear prompt, which was frustrating.",
    "This course is a puzzle to me. The material is very interesting, but the class is infuritating in that the professor zooms through the powerpoint slides. there is a final exam and a research paper, and there is no time to actually get an in-depth look at the exam material. It is also full of pre-meds looking for an HU requirement, which can be both a good and bad thing.",
    "It was an interesting course, but it was very difficult to determine what was expected of you.",
    "This is a great Cr\/D HSHM lecture, so I would definitely recommend taking it Cr\/D if you are interested in public health or HSHM. Would not recommend taking it for a grade, as there are too few opportunities to even get a good grade in the first place [grade breakdown was two (rather challenging) exams + one research paper]. I was much more relaxed approaching this class with the knowledge that getting a C would do me no better than getting an A. The extra effort required to get an A does not pay off in the long run and I was very happy and interested in the material approaching the class with this mindset.",
    "Do not take this class fellow student. The material and the idea of the material were fascinating indeed. However, the structure was poor, confusing, and not something you want to have to deal with.",
    "Probably not. A pretty unnuanced version of American history, with some public health figures\/events thrown in. A lot of students felt the exams were harshly graded, which made it way more stressful than it needed to be.",
    "I think this is a good introductory history of science and medicine class. I would recommend it to anyone considering the maipr or people interested in pursuing a career in medicine or public health because it provides an important historical foundation to the medical and public health professions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course because I learned a lot, had a really great TA, and thought that Professor Rogers was a fantastic lecturer.",
    "A pretty good 5th class, workload isnt too bad and the subject matter is interesting. Not going to be the most fun class you ever take at Yale",
    "I would recommend this course if you know you want to get into a class with loads more history than current public health theory. I came into it thinking there would be more modern-day public health information than there really was, so it was an adjustment getting used to the copious amount of history being thrown out. The course is fast-paced and impersonal, although sections provide a bit more time to develop personal opinions to the topics - just know what you're getting into!",
    "Yes I would. Extremely helpful course for anyone interested in public health that teaches how the current state of public health and related issues have evolved to inform why they are as they are today",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to see what the history of medicine is like since this course gives a good overview as to what happened in public health ever since 1793 and stretches all the way to the 21st century. It's a very eye-opening and comprehensive course. The workload is not as bad as other classes but there are also not a lot of assessments which puts pressure on to do well on all of them.",
    "Any student who wants to learn about the American Public health system from a variety of different approaches should take this course. Prof. Rogers is an enthusiastic lecturer whose expertise and passion for the subject is clear from the first lecture. The class is very well structured and taught; make sure you LOVE your TA as I did because that will make or break your experience (they grade your research papers \/ provide feedback for them!).",
    "Ya I would recommend it! It definitely isn't stressful or anything",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great HSHM survey course, which covers a lot of really cool information, events, and people. If one has any interest in history, medicine, public health, politics, gender studies, or activism, definitely take this class.",
    "It's a great course that gives you a clear overview of the history of public health. The professor is engaging and the material is interesting. I'd recommend to take it!",
    "Yes. This course does exactly what the title says it will. Luckily, my section was amazing and also added to the content I got from this course.",
    "Yes definitely! It gives a great overview of not only the American public health system from 1793 to the present, but also other important aspects of American history throughout the same time span.",
    "If you're interested in public health or healthcare, it's a pretty easy class that will give you good background knowledge. Don't take it if you're actually not interested in the subkect, as you will have to do many readings - if you don't do them you will have problems at the end of the course (when literally all the assessments are).",
    "Yes! Just be aware that its a little weirdly organized at times",
    "Yes, yes, yes! As a Computer Science major, I took this course because I was genuinely interested in public health and history and wanted to see how these two areas connected! This course is a wonderful overview of public health and the readings are fascinating so sometimes it does not even feel like work. Also, Professor Rogers is a wonderful lecturer and so the classes go by before you even know it--sometimes, you want to stay and hear more!",
    "Would recommend if you are interested in HSHM and public health.",
    "Yes, the class was well taught and pretty interesting.",
    "Yes. Prof. Rogers is a great lecturer!",
    "I think that this is well set up as a history class - the topics discussed each week are interesting, it is pretty well organized, and you will end up learning a lot of information. That being said, the lectures aren't always the most exciting unless you are passionate about the topic and I think that your experience of how good and approachable the class is will depend on your TF.",
    "Yes it was interesting.",
    "Do not take this course. Please do not take this course. Half of the topics were not actually about public health (for example, we talked about the Chinese Exclusion Act, National Origins Act, forced busing into suburbs, and women getting into medical school), while we did not talk about important parts of the history of American public health (for example, we never mentioned the polio vaccine). When Prof. Rogers talked about scientific breakthroughs in public health, she often presented them at a very surface level. It was clear that she had negative views of many of the scientists making the breakthroughs (this was particularly obvious when we talked about AIDS and she called the disagreements over who discovered the virus embarrassing). The entire course was just a load of unnecessary information presented at a very surface level. There was no analysis. We would go through lists of names and dates relating to a subject and be expected to memorize all of them, while the sections and tests never went into detailed analyses about why any of this was important. Talking about fewer topics in greater depth would have been more productive. For example, we went through the entire history of the Civil Rights Era and public health in one lecture, when we could have easily spent an entire class just on the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. Prof. Rogers often presented her unsubstantiated opinions as facts, which the class could have done without (for example, The CDC was cocky before the AIDS epidemic and This [overweight former slave] woman on the screen probably isnt going to answer the government reporters questions). This made the contrast between the level of analysis presented in classes, sections, and tests even more stark from what we were expected to produce in our papers. Prof. Rogers also had a bad habit of starting lectures five minutes early and ending either five to ten minutes early or five minutes late. There was no consistency. I also had a terrible TA, but I have heard that the other TAs were better. Overall, again, please do not take this class. There are better ones if you are interested in history or public health. Take a course in the School of Public Health if you are interested in public health, or take an American History course if you are interested in American History. Do not take this course."
