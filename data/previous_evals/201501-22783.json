   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in Buddhism, take this course. Professor Quintman is excellent and willing to help no matter what. The work is totally manageable, and the discussions make the time fly by. Definitely a great seminar. If you aren't a religious studies major, it was also a great class to offset your other coursework - it made the reading more enjoyable rather than mundane.",
    "YES. Wonderful course. Definitely take if you have any interest in: religion, psychology, cognitive science, gender studies, and East vs. Western cultural differences.",
    "This is a fantastic course for anyone of any background level looking to learn more about the Buddhist Tradition. Professor Quintman is very approachable, interested in the perspectives of students, patient, and clear in his explanations. One of my favorite courses during my time at Yale.",
    "This course is not a course on how to meditate-- it's much better than that. Take it if you're at all interested in learning about human nature from a perspective outside of the traditional Western viewpoints we encounter in most other classes.",
    "Buddhist Mind & Meditation provides a opportunity to think a really different way (unless you're already immersed in Buddhist studies, of course). I really enjoyed class discussion, and Professor Quintman is really invested in the seminar",
    "YES"
