   "comments": [
    "The class topics are all interesting in their own right, but the course covers so many different time periods and technologies that not much time is spent on any one topic. For some this may be frustrating because you don't get to learn much in depth information, and the material moves rather fast. It is imperative that you attend lecture since there are no class notes, and the lectures almost always include information outside of the week's readings. If you do not like memorizing people, places, dates, etc., then this may not be the class for you. While a lot of emphasis is placed on broad themes, you are expected to know specifics.",
    "Take this class! The information covered will be useful to people with a wide variety of majors\/fields, because it focuses not only on the inventions\/innovators themselves but also on the social, political, economic, medical, and cultural issues surround them. Also, a lot of the material is really relevant to current events.",
    "I would recommend the course... not a bad workload, interesting material.",
    "Yes",
    "Hums 323 was terrific! I write this having just completed the final exam and reviewing the course material collectively. In preparing for the final, I realized just how profoundly this course has changed the way I view the advancement of science -- in terms of the role of the military, philanthropy, individuals, etc. As someone who plans to spend their life in scientific arena, I feel very enriched!",
    "No, little work, but so so boring, and frankly a waste of time",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who really likes American history because it is a great overview of the science and technology of our country's history.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it doesn't require much work to be done but a lot of studying may be required.",
    "if you are very interested in the material, yes, but the lectures are not great",
    "I would NOT recommend this course. The readings and materials are interesting, but the lectures are painful. The professor does not introduce the material in an engaging manner and reads from a script. The workload is low, but it's a long, boring, and painful semester.",
    "This was a good class. If you're interested in the topic, you'll enjoy going to lecture - you start at Franklin and the years before America received its independence, and go all the way up to Facebook. The only weakness was the lecturing style of Professor Kevles. It seemedlike he read most of the lectures verbatim off of a pre-written document rather than just having notes like most professors have. This wasn't really a big deal, but I feel like the lectures would be a little more interesting if they were done more on the fly. Otherwise, it's a good class overall, sections were interesting, and you should take it if you're interested in the topic.",
    "Yes but only if you are interested in this specific kind of history or a science major looking for a history course."
