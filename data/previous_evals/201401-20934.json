   "comments": [
    "Physics 201 is a medium level introductory E and M class, that focuses on the vector calculus parts of Maxwell's Equations. Taking Physics 200 before it is not necessary.",
    "I imagine the class will be very different with a different instructor, but certainly if Jack Harris teaches this class again I would highly recommend it. The course was paced excellently. We were introduced to Maxwell's equations, vector calculus, and some basic techniques for tackling differential equations, all in a way I can see myself actually remembering. Best class of my freshman year.",
    "Take the course if you want a comprehensive introduction to mathematically rigorous electricity and magnetism",
    "Basically just the 2nd half of the 200 sequence, not terribly difficult but a solid foundation for physics\/science majors.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking PHYS 201 if you're looking for a good grade but aren't a physics\/engineering\/math major because most of the people in this class are engineering majors. The material is very math-y so it can sometimes be very dense. I took it to fulfill pre-med requirements and found that the more proof-based math portions were difficult and not particularly useful for pre-med purposes. That being said, if you're really interested in physics and want to learn a lot, Prof. Harris teaches extremely well.",
    "If you need to take JUST a phys course, this is too hard. If your area of interest includes physics, go for it. you will suffer but you will enjoy.",
    "Good course if you are interested in physics or if it is required. Good class environment. Not an easy class.",
    "PHYS 201, taught by Professor Jack Harris, was a great course. Although difficult at times, with the help of physics study hall and Jack Harris's very good lectures, it was a class from which I learned a lot. It was not an unreasonably difficult course. You get a good introduction to electricity and magnetism which is wrapped up nicely with a discussion on quantum mechanics and its similarities and differences to classical mechanics.",
    "This is the right level if you took AP Physics B, but if you took C you should take Physics 261 because I hear it's better taught. Physics 201 was kind of a dull class for me, as someone who doesn't really like E&M, although I was baffled to hear that some of my friends were actually enjoying it, so I guess to each his\/her own. I think it's probably fair to say though that this class is not one of Yale's gems. Maybe Tipton will teach it again soon; he was clearer.",
    "I sincerely wish Prof. Golling had continued teaching this class. If you're taking it, I know you probably don't have a choice, but this was one of the worst classes I've had at Yale. Not due to difficulty or material or anything like that. I just feel like the professor just didn't really care. So many of the psets had last-minute corrections that hours of work were wasted, and there were no lecture notes (he used Golling's from last year, which didn't match this year's class well) and no practice exams. Overall, I feel that Yale just really needs to work on improving its intro physics classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course as a good introduction to electricity and magnetism",
    "Quite a bit of work. Coming out the other side, I still don't really understand E&M or quantum, but oh well.",
    "Class is ok. You will learn some interesting things and also some weird and ostensibly useless things as well. Lectures are generally very good. Professor Harris is a great lecturer and also a very good advisor. However, Problems sets were often very difficult in strange ways and unrelated to what we did in class.",
    "It's a good intro Physics course. Definitely requires a lot of work. But overall is a rewarding class to take.",
    "If you are good at math, take 260, if you just need this for a requirement and don't feel like going above and beyond for your grasp of physics knowledge, take 180. If you're willing to work, struggle, fail, and then succeed, take this class.",
    "This is a very challenging class, but if Jack Harris is teaching, be sure you already know differential equations very well. He teaches it in class, but my lack of familiarity with the subject made the tests and homework very challenging (I did not get a good grade--gasp!). I am a STEM person (took PHYS 201, AP Physics C mech+e&m in highschool), but I still didn't feel that I was on this course's level. Prof. Harris was generally and excellent lecturer and taught the subject very clearly, but I feel that it was a little bit too hard for people without a huge math and physics background. Many people dropped to 181. Good class, but very hard, psets weren't terribly long, but midterms were brutal. Don't take this if you don't like differential eqs or vector calculus. Do take it if you want to taste what higher level physics is like.",
    "PHYS 201 is a good continuation, and Jack Harris is a great professor. Be prepared for a lot of math in the class, and make sure you go to lecture - he taught it differently and the book wasn't helpful at all.",
    "A large chunk of the course is doing nasty multivariable calculus problems with Maxwell's equations, don't take without Math 120! Jack Harris is great at portraying the larger picture. You get a taste of how classical, relativistic and quantum physics are related in this course, which I thought was the coolest.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any one who interested in physics.",
    "Personally I found PHYS 201 to be considerably more difficult than PHYS 200. Reasons might be that electromagnetism, which takes up almost the entire course, is not my favorite topic and I also struggled with the calculus. If you really love physics you should take 201, but if you don't want it to get more difficult than PHYS 200, I would recommend 181 instead.",
    "Basic introduction to electromagnetism. A must take."
