   "comments": [
    "Lots of knowledge and insight about the Civil War era and its many influential thinkers, poets, and effects on modern life. Some skill development via the writing assignments, but I found them mostly perfunctory.",
    "An absolute gem of a course. If you take one history course at Yale, make it this one. If you are a history major you are doing yourself a disservice by not taking this.",
    "Learned a great deal about the social climate, politics, surrounding the civil war",
    "I now have a more-than-basic understanding of the causes, course, and consequences of Civil War and Reconstruction. I have improved my ability to analyze primary and secondary source documents, along with the strengths and weaknesses of various types of media that cover the Civil War and Reconstruction.",
    "I learned about the international aspects of the Civil War, but most of the other information I knew from my APUSH class in high school, we just went in much more detail.",
    "I learned about the causes, course, and consequences of the Civil War. I also learned how to evaluate primary and secondary sources and use them to construct an argument and an essay.",
    "How to write a history paper",
    "I was able to learn a great deal about the historical significance of the Civil War and especially its memory today. Professor Blight made many different arguments for the course, causes, and consequences for the war, and in such a sense was able to open my eyes to the complexity of the tensions during the era and why the war was fought to begin with. I learned to analyze primary source documents more clearly and thoroughly, and to engage in meaningful discussions on what I read throughout the week. Speaking and writing were critical to success in this class and I firmly believe my skills in these areas were significantly improved as a result.",
    "Strategic reading skills, primary source analysis, analytical and precise writing.",
    "In this class, I learned the skill of \"strategic reading\", which is something I wish I had been taught my freshman year. I also learned about the causes and consequences of America's bloodiest war.",
    "I learned how to glean history from literature and poetry of the time, rather than reading purely historical academic texts which I enjoyed. I also learned to write more effectively in history.",
    "I learned a lot about the Civil War that no other history class has taught me, namely how it affected the people who fought and the generations to follow. The class taught me to incorporate nontraditional sources into historical discussion, like poetry and literature.",
    "Learned a huge amount about the history and even more about the historiography. The material in this course is \/vital\/ to understanding anything about politics today, and the strings between 1865 and 2017 are highlighted repeatedly and made absolutely clear to an attentive student. This is one of the best courses at Yale.",
    "I learned about a different side of Civil War History that was not taught by the textbooks. I learned how to read and incorporate primary sources into essays.",
    "My high school didn't offer APUSH, this was a great way to learn a bit more about the facts of the war, its legacy, and its relevance to our modern lives.",
    "Not much!",
    "I gained significant knowledge from this course. While I had learned about the antebellum era, Civil War, and Reconstruction era in high school, I had never learned about them at the college level. As such, the breadth and depth of my knowledge of those eras increased substantially because of the course.",
    "As a non-history major, I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot about the Civil War I did not know from conventional teaching in high school. Blight's class offers a rich exploration of the complex dimensions of the Civil War that anyone can appreciate.",
    "This course provided an excellent introduction to Civil War history and memory. It focuses more on cultural and microhistories of the war than it does on military history, and Professor Blight does a wonderful job of integrating literature and poetry into the usual primary source texts.",
    "A knowledge of the causes & consequwneces of the american civil war, plus some skills re: writing history papers and strategically reading historical text",
    "I learned new ways of studying the Civil War.",
    "This course was a wonderful survey of the thoughts and ideas surrounding the cause, course, and consequences around the Civil War. Instead of focussing on tedious series of events, Professor Blight creates a wider picture that emphasizes personal accounts, literature, and images. The course is great if you are considering the history major and want to practice history methodologies. The TFs structured the reading responses and the sections like training sessions for writing and analyzing history.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot about why the US is the way is it today. I'm not American, and this gave me so much context for this country. I also learned a lot about historical memory and legacy, how to read and write different types of historical sources, and about the power of historians in shaping the way we view foundational events.",
    "I learned a lot about the Civil War, many details that I didn't know before and expanded my knowledge of one of the most important pieces of American history.",
    "This class taught me a lot about the history of the Civil War, Reconstruction. More importantly though, it taught me how to examine United States history and contemporary politics through a framework of understanding the Civil War's legacy. The process of writing the two papers for the class was also a helpful experience, as it forced me to think of the subject matter in a nuanced way-- instead of the basic \"Slavery caused the Civil War\" essay that many of us probably wrote in AP U.S. History.",
    "This course really expanded the way I had previously thought about the history of the Civil War and the Reconstruction period. Besides just learning about the facts or historic moments during this significant time period, we were encouraged to think critically about the causes, course, and consequences of the Civil War and how those factors shaped Reconstruction. It was interesting to view the subject matter from a variety of perspectives, whether it be through the lens of fugitive slaves or women on both sides of the war. I also learned about different mediums with which to record history and how those shape one's perspective as well as the different types of history there are out there. This was a really great class to delve into a deep analysis of the Civil War and Reconstruction, far beyond any U.S. history class one might have taken in high school.",
    "Professor Blight explores completely different aspects of the Civil War than those taught in high school and 'big history' classes. He doesn't focus on battles nor overarching strategy, but instead social history. His research area of civil war memory is fascinating, especially as he connects it to more modern issues of belonging and civil rights.",
    "This course helped me learn how to condense a paper. As a writer, I have a new appreciation for conciseness after the challenge of explaining the cause of the Civil War in five pages. While it was an annoying exercise at the time, I think that such assignments help to teach economical writing.",
    "Primary source analysis, critical thinking, and historical reasoning.",
    "This course made me really feel the significance of the Civil War, Emancipation, and Reconstruction as powerful and meaningful events in American history with moral and political resonances today.",
    "This course helped me sharpen my critical essay writing skills and work with primary and secondary documents to form arguments about the causes and event which we were studying.",
    "Detailed knowledge of Civil War and Reconstruction in the United States from 1845 to 1877, insight into the historiography of the Civil War and the importance of cultural memory, direct access to helpful primary sources and speeches from the time, critical thinking skills on how to analyze and critique historical literature and primary sources, good practice writing history essays (as helpful as my WR credits even though the course is not a WR).",
    "I learned an in-depth history of the events leading up to, following and during the American Civil War. Professor Blight tried to make connections between his era of study and today. The readings ranged from primary sources to biography to historical fiction and offered a multi-faceted impression of the War and its legacy. It was a great course to practice history writing and to review the material because the prompts were straightforward and drew heavily on events discussed in class.",
    "I learned a holistic overview of the causes, course, and consequences of the U.S. Civl War. The course begins with the causes of the Civil War: the growing divide between the North and South, as well as the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Dred Scott Decision, and John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry. It then explores the significant battles and decisions taken through the war, especially through the eyes of Lincoln. It lastly talks about the successes and failures of Reconstruction.",
    "I learned a ton of facts about the Civil War that I think, as an American, are important to know. More importantly, from those facts, I got a larger sense of the arc and significance of the war that I hadn't gotten before from learning about it in K-12 school. I learned historical thinking skills and how to interrogate how historical memory works and how the narratives we tell ourselves today about the Civil War developed.",
    "Basic overview of Civil War history; skills for analyzing primary sources; essay writing practice and selecting the most useful evidence",
    "I learned a lot about history of american race relations.",
    "I learned a pretty comprehensive review of the origins, causes, happenings, and aftermath of the American Civil War.",
    "This class offered helped me improve my critical thinking skills because of the wide range of readings which offered interesting or new viewpoints I had never considered. The class has two papers that require the use of primary source documents to synthesize a thesis and these papers helped me improve my writing skills. Finally David Blight offered indepth analysis of the Civil War and of Reconstruction that a high school APUSH class does not have time to do which helped me to understand the war at a more sophisticated level.",
    "This was a highly enjoyable course, one of the best classes I've ever taken actually, and beyond just many insights into the Civil War which my more general experience with US history hadn't provided me with, I learned many valuable skills such as strategies to get through a heavy reading load, historical writing skills, and critical analysis skills as applied to the historical readings we did and also just more generally to examine the biases of the course itself.",
    "I gained knowledge of the Civil War and Reconstruction period and insights into how the events of those periods affect our country today. I also gained skills in the study of history, especially in the use of primary source documents."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course's strengths are the Teaching Fellows and Professor Blight's depth of knowledge and experience in this period. It could be improved by respecting students' time more regularly (ending lectures on time) and providing a version of Blight's reading passages from lecture for students to access later on (i.e., even a reference sheet to some of the poems read in class).",
    "Blight does a fantastic job of assigning interesting and important readings from a wide breadth of sources and effectively expressing the events of the war through that. In lecture he is able to then expand on themes and social aspects of the war. I don't believe he has changed much and he shouldn't this course is one that can only be taught by Blight and should not be skipped.",
    "The course offers a robust and diverse amount of Civil War interpretations. It is truly comprehensive. Nevertheless, Blight suggests an overwhelming amount of material as supplementary. It was difficult to keep up with. On top of that, he wanted students to watch Ken Burns: The Civil War. I only got to about half. He also regularly goes over the 50 minute block. Luckily, I had nothing in the 11:35 time slot on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but I wouldn't be surprised if others were bothered by this.",
    "There was too much reading, such that it was impossible to truly digest one thing.",
    "I don't think this course can be improved too much, since it is already so interesting. Lecture was always fascinating, if a bit long. The course readings were sometimes dense, and the primary sources were not always the most compelling documents, but it's history so not much you can change here.",
    "Lecture had too much poetry. Readings were too numerous to decide what was actually important.. Good prof w lots of primary sources in readings and lecture that were fun.",
    "Strengths - a very, very well qualified group of TFs. These TFs were incredibly knowledgeable and definitely aided my undertaking of the Civil War through engaging discussions and helpful critiques of my writing. Professor Blight's lectures were also incredibly engaging and focused heavily on topics that were crucial to understanding the significance of the era.",
    "One of my absolute favorite courses. Not sure how it can be improved. Blight is as much an entertainer as lecturer. Sections were organized and conducive to conceptualizing and understanding the period at a deep level.",
    "The couse was taught by an excellent professor and there were great TAs. I just wish there had been a better sense of timeline when discussing the historical events.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot in section if you have a good TA, the readings are pretty interesting, the assignments are doable. Weaknesses: Lecture is pretty much useless. Even though David Blight is interesting, the lectures don't really help with the assignments or the exam. Because of that, there is a LOT of reading to make up for it.",
    "David Blight is an expert in the field and clearly could talk for days about the material. What frustrated me was that he spent the first 20 minutes of every class reading primary source or literature material and then finishing 10 minutes late consistently. While the literature was interesting, I felt it could've been cut down and I would've really appreciated more focused lectures (and ones that ended on time.) I thought the essay prompts were always fair, though the final exam essay questions could have been more focused. This class could benefit from a midterm exam and a non-cumulative final because it ended up being a ton to study\/memorize in the end. In addition, I found the reading load unwieldy. We were frequently assigned 300 pages per week, which is uncommon for a history lecture and made it really difficult to keep up.",
    "The course is not a military history course, which is its real strength. However, there were several major weaknesses. One, there was too much reading for a lecture course. If the number of secondary sources was reduced dramatically and a course packet of excerpts from primary sources and literature were added, it would be much more manageable. Relaredly, too much time in class was spent reading quotes from sources. Those quotes should be the readings we do outside of class and discuss in section. Finally, every class went long,, which is not respectful of our time.",
    "Too much reading - I dont think anyone actually did all of it",
    "As should be evident from every other review of this course, the content is fantastic. However, I'd like to note that there was not a single class where Professor Blight stayed within his allotted timeframe; most days, he went five to ten minutes over. This would be fine -- more David Blight is never a bad thing -- except that this class ended at 11:20 and I had an 11:35 class on the other side of campus which, thanks to the poorly-planned timing of this class, I was consistently late for.",
    "Strengths: by far the best parts of this course were Professor Blight's lectures. He is obviously an expert on the war, and his lectures were so engaging that I'd often get so wrapped up in listening to him that I'd forget to take notes. Weaknesses: I think the TAs were a hit or a miss, and the grading was a little weird -- everyone I know did way worse than they expected on their first essay and way better on their second. Sections sometimes felt like they weren't always that connected to the lectures.",
    "Professor Blight tends to ramble, a lot.",
    "There are several strengths of the course. The first is obviously its content. The causes, course, and consequences of the Civil War are profoundly significant events in American (and indeed world) history that are still highly resonant today. The second main strength of the course is Professor Blight. He is one of the titans of Civil War history in the United States and it is a unique privilege to get to learn about the Civil War from him. Unfortunately, the course also has several weaknesses though. I will discuss the weaknesses of Professor Blight farther down. But in terms of the course itself, the biggest weakness was definitely the workload. I don't use this word lightly, but the amount of reading assigned for the course was simply outrageous. This is especially the case given that it isn't a history seminar, but an introductory level history class. Administrators, teachers, and teaching assistants should be aware that there is a phenomenon at Yale that I've experienced and that I've witnessed with many of my peers that if there is an overwhelming amount of reading many students decide to do none or practically none of it instead of even attempting to read it all because they know they don't even have a chance of reading it all. This was the case week after week for Civil War, especially in the middle-end of the semester, which is a uniquely difficult time given the midterms and papers students had for this class and others. I think the class would greatly, greatly benefit from a very substantially trimmed down course load. I understand that there is an immense amount that has been written about the Civil War. But by assigning fewer entire monographs and instead focusing on primary sources and articles, I think the course would be greatly improved. The other main weakness of the course that I wanted to touch on briefly is the grading. I don't yet know what my final grade for the course will be, but the grading for the two papers was definitely a bit surprising in terms of its harshness for an intro-level class. This may discourage students in the future.",
    "Professor Blight can really go all over the place in lecture (although he has a great teaching personality) so you get much of the structural understanding in section. I think organizing each lectures to target the major themes and readings within the 50 minutes would help!",
    "strengths: interesting lectures, great books, fair final & papers. weaknesses: see instructor weaknesses, plus the syllabus listed too much reading to do in a standard week--our TF generally had to tell us what to prioritize, which for me is a good indicator that there's too much on there.",
    "Most of the lectures were very interesting; there could have been less reading.",
    "I think that the reading was excessive for this course. There was no way for me to get through it all in one week. Professor Blight also has a tendency to lecture past time. While his lectures are beautiful and I enjoyed listening to them, they can also spend a lot of time on literature, poetry, and personal narratives and less time on the actual material. I also wish we had a screening go the last episode of the Ken Burns series as a class.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures and learned a lot but there was an unreasonable amount of reading that no student realistically could've done all of it unless this was the only course they were taking.",
    "Blight is a fantastic lecturer and I was always excited to come to class. He is a particularly good storyteller and helped explain the Civil War as a cohesive narrative rather than a string of events. I also think the readings of this class are a great strength, as they are dynamic and lead to really great section discussions. The central weakness of the book that I would change is the decision to read \"The March\" by E.L. Doctorow. While I understand the purpose of reading a piece of historical fiction in order to understand the way in which Civil War memory has been skewed in popular culture, I think that the week devoted to reading this book could be better dedicated to a text that touches on the significance of the Civil War for black women (a perspective that this course really does not touch on that much). Confederate Reckoning discusses white women the slave narratives we read portray black men, but I feel like this perspective was missing from this course's discussions. I might suggest Harriet Ann Jacobs's \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.\" Also, I couldn't help but notice that in a class about the Civil War, there was not a single Black teaching fellow or female teaching fellow. This lack of representation suggests a bias in the selection process, and I hope this can be remedied in the future.",
    "I think using a portion of section every week to review the last couple of lectures would be great. Also I think that there was borderline too much reading.",
    "I thought this class was well structured in that it was divided into three logical sections: the antebellum period, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. In particular, I loved the selection of books in this course and how each seemed to broaden the viewpoints brought about in lecture. I found myself really interested by the readings and viewed the subject matter from different perspectives thanks to the readings. The papers were also well positioned such that I was able to really reflect on the completion of one section and put my thoughts onto paper. And of course, the lectures were phenomenal; Professor Blight really told a story through his lectures and helped the history come alive. As for the course's weakness, this is only a personal gripe, but I wish there had been some time at the end of the course dedicated to reflecting on slavery's place today (not just the memory of the Civil War, but for example, whether one would see the modern prison system as a rebirth of the slave system).",
    "Fantastic lecturing. No major weaknesses.",
    "Great class. One comment is that Blight appears to neither know nor care when the lecture ends however. We literally never ended on time.",
    "I enjoyed the multifaceted approach this course took to a period of history most American children learn at least three separate times before university. Looking at novels, primary sources, and secondary sources helped keep the subject interesting while also engaging us as historians. I think that the course could be improved by making more liberal use of the international lens of the war rather than confining it to a single lecture. The argument of the lecture and the assigned book on the matter seemed to be that there was this great, forgotten interplay between the Civil War and the audience abroad, yet the course only mentioned great players like Britain and France incidentally after that particular lecture.",
    "Professor Blight is a very strong and engaging lecturer but often ran over the scheduled end of lectures, which was frustrating and sometimes conflicted with later appointments, etc. Section was also engaging and overall the course was quite strong as a whole.",
    "The course gives a broad but thorough overview of both the Civil War and Reconstruction: certainly emphasizing a certain view of the war, but offering a broad range of perspectives throughout. The reading was at times a little too much to keep up with. Overall I was really pleased with the reading that was selected though and appreciated that it was a mix of primary sources and critical documents.",
    "Strengths: Blight's lectures are amazing - both informative and beautifully worded; material is very interesting; sections are very helpful and TF's are strong; essays are not too much work and interesting to write. Weaknesses: reading load is extremely high and very few people complete the readings each week; no information from lecture is posted online so missing class is difficult. This class was overall one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It could only be improved by consolidating the reading load to a slightly more manageable amount per week.",
    "Mostly interesting lectures covered many aspects of the time period and helped bring history to life. Sections were well run, which was very helpful for such a large class. Good selection of readings. Not a huge fan of The March, but its timing around Spring Break was well-planned. I especially liked McCurry's Confederate Reckoning.",
    "Strengths of this class include the quality of the material of the lecture and Professor Blight's passion for the Civil War. Also, the quality and breadth of the readings were fantastic. I really enjoyed discussion section as it expanded the scope of what we were learning. The only weakness of the class, I would say, is how Professor Blight would often get sidetracked, and either keep us later than intended or not finish all the material he had for the day.",
    "This was a great class. One thing I couldn't help but notice, though, and talked about with many other people in the class-- all the TFs were male and almost all of them were white. What's that about? I haven't taken a ton of other history classes so I don't know how common this is across the department, but I do know that this demographic was particularly troubling in a class on the Civil War, which different groups of people lay claim to in different ways but which has traditionally been the domain of white males.",
    "The strongest point of the course was the emphasis on primary sources. The lectures, while very interesting, sometimes got off track. The course would also benefit from weekly reading responses.",
    "lectures should end on time and be a little more organized.",
    "Strength: you cannot get more informed and engaging than Blight Weakness: too large a class",
    "David Blight is a fantastic lecturer who engages the class with anecdotes, pictures, and poems. The course readings cover a wide range of questions about the Civil War and Reconstruction which really broadened my understanding and how I think about the history. That aren't any weaknesses to the class that I notice but perhaps if there was more time the class could offer more readings about how Native Americans are relevant to this time.",
    "I think that by far the greatest strength of this course is Professor Blight. He is an amazing lecturer, making every lecture engaging and interesting, almost weaving a tale of the Civil War. Every single lecture I went to was unparalleled and kept my attention throughout. Another strength of the course was the assigned readings. I felt that almost every book we read and discussed added nuance and new and interesting information that we would not have otherwise gleaned from just the lectures. One recommendation I have would be to maybe focus the reading assignments and narrow them down to the most essential texts as it was at times overwhelming and thus I felt that I ended up absorbing less that I should have.",
    "Strengths: in-depth coverage of the causes, course, and consequences of the Civil War and Reconstruction and analysis of how things might have gone differently, engaging, extremely relevant and interesting material, great sources and books, interesting and engaging lectures, great integration of primary sources Weaknesses: often too much reading, more than plausibly doable, without clear prioritization of the readings"

   "comments": [
    "This course has achieved legendary status, and it's well deserved. Lectures are an opportunity to hear David Blight think and speak--don't expect them to be organized or comprehensive and enjoy them for what they are. Do the readings for context, but if you took any American history beforehand you will probably know enough to get by with lectures and primary source readers.",
    "If you have any interest at all you must take this class. In fact if you wish to be a properly educated American citizen you must take this class. The Civil War still dominates the American psyche and nothing can allow you to get a better introduction or delve deeply into the continuing pangs of its existence like this class. I implore you, enroll. You will not regret it.",
    "Very relevant, especially today when the meanings of the Civil War continue to be debated",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend the course. Granted, I took it Credit\/D and regularly attended lecture. Blight puts so much into the course that I couldn't not go to lecture. He's quite the character who might love citing a lot of passages that don't prove to be relevant at paper or exam time, but it's hard not to enjoy. There was a lot of reading some weeks that I frequently had the luxury of skimming or ignoring, but take note of that. It was hard to keep up with McPherson's \"Battle Cry of Freedom,\" for example. The same is true for the Gienapp and Lincoln documents, along with Foner's short history of Reconstruction. Still, I enjoyed it. The Civil War is worth learning and incredibly fascinating. I entered with a very limited understanding of the military history of the war.",
    "I think the content of this course is relevant to every American and its ramifications are still being felt today. So, to be an informed citizen, take this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student because I believed that it truly helped improve the way that I think critically about the world around me and about the opinions that other people have, especially when they differ from my own. This course opened my eyes to the complexities of many issues that led to the Civil War and as a result, I think many other people at Yale would would values such an eye-opening experience.",
    "Absolutely. Blight's lectures are as much entertainment as they are enlightening. You have 2 5-page papers and a final. It's relatively relaxed and extremely engaging. This class and Tim Snyders Eastern Europe lectures have been my two favorite at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend. It was an incredible course that stands out as one of the most memorable, well taught, relevant classes here at Yale. David Blight is an incredible professor.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was a great lecture.",
    "Only take this class if you are willing to be kept 10-15 minutes late each lecture after learning nothing that will help you with the papers or final and you are sure you'll get a good TA. The TA I had was great and taught me everything I learned in this course. There is too much reading because that's where 80% of the instruction is supposed to happen. Blight also made snide political references almost every lecture, and while I agree with his politics, it got old really quickly. He also talked audibly to the TAs and even the whole class for nearly the ENTIRE final exam. I have never been in an exam that was so disrupted and it's shocking that it was the professor's fault. The course material is interesting, it's the Civil War and Reconstruction. But just watch the Ken Burns documentary instead of taking the class. It's more enjoyable and educational. It says a lot that to study for this exam all I did was reread the chapters on Civil War and Reconstruction from my AP US History textbook. This course was barely more nuanced than a high school class.",
    "If you're really interested in the civil war, go for it. Blight is an expert in the field and you will do a lot of reading and come out smarter. That being said, I found the course really frustrating. Blight spends the first 20 minutes of every class reading some poetry or literature out loud, which while interesting often goes on for too long and means that we don't get to the actual material we were supposed to for the day. He finishes all his lectures 10 minutes late and then held classes during reading week, which I just found to be disrespectful of people's time. The TFs are smart and helpful, but the reading assigned for the class was frequently unwieldy -- 300 pages per week which I found unfeasible for a history lecture (and I've taken many.)",
    "This is not a military history class, which is great if you don't want to hear about battles all semester. However, there's a lot of reading, which can sometimes make the class unmanageable. Blight's lectures are interesting, though they always seem to run over time.",
    "Yes - awesome course, a Yale classic. Blight is amazing",
    "Absolutely take this course - a vital part of understanding modern politics and a necessary piece of any complete knowledge of American history. If you think you know about the Civil War now, take this class and reflect once you're finished.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Blight is an incredibly captivating story teller. I loved going to lecture and learning a different side of Civil War History that wasn't taught in our high school textbooks.",
    "I'm not entirely sure. Honestly, I think I would have gotten just as much out of the course if I'd audited it. That being said, it really isn't a ton of work (although studying for the final can be a little scary), so if enrolling is the only way you can convince yourself to come to lectures, go for it. If not, save yourself the hassle of sections and just come to listen to Blight.",
    "No. Take it on Yale Open courses if you're that interested in the subject.",
    "I may or may not recommend this course to another student. If the amount of reading, the course's biggest weakness by far, isn't trimmed down substantially, I might seriously caution other students against taking on such a large burden. However, the content of the course is fascinating, and that would definitely impel me to recommend the course to other friends that I know already have some interest in history and\/or race.",
    "Yes, it was great.",
    "Yes! I took this course Cr\/D which was great because I didn't have to keep up as much with the readings. I could go to lecture and enjoy the retelling of the Civil War through Blight's historian persona. However, this is not a hard class. If you do most of the readings and go to lecture and section, you can do very well.",
    "Absolutely yes.",
    "A fun and informative intro to the civil war. Not too much work (2 6-pg papers and a final), but there's more reading on the syllabus than you can probably do. Lectures are showy and fun but reliably go over time--don't book anything right after.",
    "Yes, for the lectures",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in Civil War memory and a more holistic study of the Civil War. This is a particularly good class for prospective History majors. David Blight is wonderful and you should take a class with him before you graduate.",
    "Absolutely take it. Must take to understand the US as it is today. Also great marriage between dense historical readings and more poetic, contextual lectures from Prof. Blight.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is an in-depth look at the Civil War and is very interesting to learn about how this event has shaped our country today. It is a lot of reading though and is probably one of the harder history classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to take an interesting history lecture! The class workload is doable but most importantly, the lectures our fascinating and generally the TFs seemed to be really interested in teaching the material. It is easy to believe that you already know all about the Civil War if you've already taken AP U.S. History, but this class will show you that there is so much more and will highlight the ways in which Civil War memory and discussion has evolved throughout the history of the United States.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I came into the course thinking that I had learned all that I really needed to know about the Civil War and Reconstruction, but I quickly realized that there were so many complexities and nuances that I had never even touched. This course challenged me to think about the war from an international perspective, from the perspective of Confederate women, or to consider the role slaves had in emancipating themselves before Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Whether you are a history major, someone who is interested in learning more about the Civil War like myself, or really any other student, this is a chance to study an important part of American history with one of the foremost scholars in the field. You really do come out knowing a lot more than you did before.",
    "This is a seminal Yale history course.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Blight is an amazing lecturer. It's not a difficult class, it's interesting, and overall a great option for a fifth class.",
    "This is a must-take while at Yale in order to understand this country.",
    "This course is good for someone who is not very interested in the minute details of history and wants a broader, more philosophical view.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student as long as they were willing to commit the time necessary to keep up with the readings of the course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in history or learning from one of the best professors at Yale. It is interesting, informative, and reasonable in terms of workload (if you prioritize the readings).",
    "This is a great history course to learn about the history of the United States and to gain a decent understanding of the 19th century, which is often underdiscussed compared to the 18th century and 20th century in the USA. I know the lectures look big, but section will help you ensure that you will learn the material and get something out of the class. It's a classic subject and well-taught.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in history. It really expands the discussion of the Civil War beyond what you would traditionally learn in an APUSH class, for example. The books that we read are very thought provoking and I found myself thinking about the material outside of class oftentimes. Professor Blight is a great lecturer and the workload is not too intense. Great class.",
    "A great class! I took it creditD as my fifth class, and I loved listening to Blight's lectures.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students and really other Americans. Hugely important part of our national memory to continue returning to, and Blight does it in really important ways.",
    "Absolutely! Great course if you want to explore the Civil War era from all angles.",
    "It's a fantastic class! Absolutely take this class. Professor Blight is an incredible story teller and every lecture is captivating",
    "yes david blight is very knowledgable and a good professor",
    "Absolutely. It's a necessary part of American history for one to know.",
    "David Blight is a great storyteller which makes the lectures so fascinating. The class only has two 5 page papers, which are not too hard to do with two whole readers full of primary documents. The final is reasonable, and if you go to lectures and sections and if you study, it's hard not to do well. I enjoyed every reading because of the interesting viewpoints they offered. The class often runs 10 minutes over, but I stayed every time just because the subject of the lectures were always so interesting.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course! All around an amazing class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I learned so much more about the Civil War and Reconstruction and how the events of these time periods affect our country today. The course was always engaging and we read really interesting books and discussed themes that are still so important and relevant today. Professor Blight's lectures are fantastic and he was always available to talk in office hours."
