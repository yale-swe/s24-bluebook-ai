    "Good class to take for a QR",
    "Definitely. If you need a Qr, definitely take this class. My class only had 5 people in it so we became a nice little group that could get individual attention from the Math DUS. The first half of the class is very easy and though the second half is more challenging, it's doable and thought-provoking. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. The material is actually pretty useful, it's not overly hard (though it gets harder than it appears the first few weeks - you will have to work on the homework). The exams are totally manageable (easier than the homeworks). Professor Howe has tons of office hours, and the class is a really friendly environment.",
    "It is a good course with a very good professor. It does move at a quick pace though so its important to stay on top of things."
