   "comments": [
    "This course enhanced my appreciation of the complexity of epidemiological methods and the myriad issues which must be addressed in questionnaire design.",
    "Good - I would have benefited from a clearer explanation of the expectations of the homework assignments earlier in the semester. It was initially unclear to me what the goal of the assignments were, and took me a few tries to get a handle on the expectations.",
    "Really great breadth of material, and just enough depth. Some of the guest lecturers were less than stellar (ex: Biomarkers!). I did really like the structure of the course and thought a good deal of the material was useful and interesting.",
    "This course provided a great overall of measurement issues in a variety of subject areas. I enjoyed having guest speakers come in to discuss specific areas of measurement, and the homework assignments properly assessed information learned in the curriculum.",
    "strength: diversified.Weakness: not in-depth. The homework questions sometime seem to be not fitting well with the content in lecture.",
    "This was a nice, broad overview of the important issues related to measurement of exposures and outcomes in epi research. It was a fundamental course with information that I will definitely use going forward.",
    "Class was a bit choppy because of all the guest lecturers.",
    "The course is a good introduction to methods for critically approaching measurement issues in public health. However, I would have liked a bit more depth rather than breadth. Each week introduced a new measurement topic, however, we never went deeper into the fine details as the semester progressed.",
    "I enjoyed the fact that there were several guest speakers. It allowed us to hear about several diverse areas of research from different experts. I would, however, liked more of a discussion on general measruement issues like bias, sensitivity, specificity, population characteristics, etc.",
    "This course covered measurement issues related to many different public health topics (CVD, obesity, nutrition, etc.). It was incredibly informative and best of all we got to hear from experts in each field about measurement issues specific to their field.I thought the homework assignments were really useful to help synthesize the material. The final paper was also a great way to delve deeply into measurement issues related to a topic of our choice.The only drawback to the course was the genetic\/molecular epidemiology lecture. The guest lecturer clearly knew his field very well, but it was very difficult to understand him and for those of us who don't have any background in genetic\/molecular epi, it was a very hard lecture to follow.It was not designed for a \"beginner\" audience.I would have also liked to have learned more about designing and evaluating a survey. We covered this briefly in the first two lectures, but did not go back to it afterwards. I am sure there are entire courses taught on designing surveys, but delving more deeply into the psychometrics of survey development would have been helpful, especially in writing our final papers.",
    "good",
    "I thought this course was excellent. It made me think about the practical side of carrying out research and made me see measurement issues in a totally different way. Some of the guest lecturers covered material that was not completely relavant to the course objective.",
    "The lectures were helpful in expanding on the main topics, and the homeworks provided a good exercise and frame of reference for completing the midterm and final assignments.",
    "I enjoyed how the course was organized with professors from different fields speaking about measurement issues in their respective fields.",
    "I really liked this course. I think Dr. White is an excellent instructor. I would have liked her to give more lectures because she is such a great instructor.",
    "The course was helpful in addressing measurement of disease processes, a concept with which I was unfamiliar prior to the course. It was helpful to have practicing professionals deliver many of the lectures in their area of expertise so that the students could relate to the issues involved with that particular area of practice.",
    "I really enjoyed all the guest lecturers and how the material applied to different chronic diseases",
    "Good information. Not all pertinent to everyone's area of study but good overall information.",
    "The homework assignments were fairly tedious and did not provide much value. I did, however, learn a great deal from the assigned paper.",
    "This course is very important, and I learned a lot about how to measure various issues within chronic disease epi. Most importantly, I learned about how to identify and use survey methods with good psychometric properties. I found this course interesting and invaluable.",
    "covers a huge breadth of topicsI liked that experts in different fields were invited to give lectures on their topic",
    "Good general overview of issues with measurement issues. Structurally the lecture order was kind of odd but I enjoyed the guest lecturers. Good way to have exposure a variety of faculty."

You learn about a wide array of topic areas - cardiovascular disease, obesity, mortality, etc. - via lectures from guest speakers. These talks, along with Dr. White's introductory and summary lectures, provided a great overview of measurement issues in an engaging and informative way.",

    "The course covered general questionnaire design and psychometric properties (validity, reliability, specificity, etc.), and then went into detail about measurement of specifictopics by bringing in guest lecturers.
