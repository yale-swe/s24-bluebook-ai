   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Japanese 140 to a fellow student. I will caution him\/her to use the material in the textbook as a springboard to other material.Many students in the class lack the discipline totry as far as possible to speak only Japanese. Some of them are also unmotivated, which tends to put a drag on the class.",
    "Very hard work, but effective way to learn the language.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend it if you want to develop your Japanese to a serviceable state.",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you are eager to learn Japanese or if you are looking for a good language class to take. I haven't taken any other language classes, but from what I hear, Japanese seems to be one of the more engaging ones. In addition to that, the professors are always fantastic! However, this class is a little heavy on the coursework, so think about how much time you are willing to put into the class. If you do not have much time to spare in your schedule, I suggest taking this class another time!",
    "It was a great course! A lot of work, but it's definitely worth it. The teachers are great and have really invested a lot of time and effort into creating varied assignments and making the class interesting. Be prepared for at least 2 hours of homework every night and a kanji quiz everyday--but if you really want to get better at Japanese, practice is really the only way to go. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "If you want to continue with Japanese, you really have no choice. But, hell, I'd take it even if I wasn't a huge fan of the language - it's too well taught not to be my favorite course.",
    "This course is excellently taught and very rewarding. Seto-Sensei and Maruyama-Sensei are entertaining and highly capable. They make the class fun while at the same timechallenging. The workload was high and sometimes a little mindless, but overall I enjoyed the class very much. My favorite class this year.",
    "I would definitely recommend Japn 140. I LOVE \"Sura Sura,\" the textbook. It's article based, which is great for reading and vocab skills. The senseis are also awesome, and class time is always interesting and helps so much with practicing grammar."
