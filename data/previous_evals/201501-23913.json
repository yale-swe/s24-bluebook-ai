   "comments": [
    "Great political science class with a view of some macro economic factors. Highly recommend.",
    "Highly recommend for basic political economy. Great for senior essay too. Layout of the course leads to final paper and the material is broad enough for a variety of topic selections.",
    "Good survey course of political economy. Take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I found the material to be interesting and applicable in a way that most other Yale classes I've taken are not. You learn about real world components of the global economy and as a result I feel like it gives you a great blend of economics and politics - and without most of the boring, theoretical parts. I'm not someone who has taken a lot of seminars and I was slightly nervous about this one being difficult, but it was very rewarding in the end.",
    "PLSC 136 provides a very enriching analysis of major topics in international political economy and trade and immigration policies. The class is fascinating and is designed to enable students to write strong, well thought-out and well researched arguments. I would definitely recommend PLSC 136 to another student. The course material and readings are very much worth reading and discussing and Professor Peters is absolutely incredible.",
    "Trade, Money, and Power is a good introduction to political economy and covers a lot of interesting material. If you have taken a lot of economics classes there will be some overlap but it is interesting to look at things from the political perspective as well."
