   "comments": [
    "Although at times bland, this class provides you with plenty of theory and history behind theater and performance. It's mostly comprised of readings and lectures, but if you are a potential theater major (or just want to take theater classes) this class will be a solid foundation.",
    "Yes -- take it",
    "As with many classes, the lectures can be dry at times, and there is a lot of material covered in each lecture. You cannot use a computer in class, so be prepared to be constantly writing. But (particularly for prospective Theatre Studies majors) do not let this course scare you from pursuing further courses in the Theatre Studies department (for most courses require this as a prereq). Everyone has to pay their dues: consider this class yours.",
    "A good overview of theater. It is a necessity to take the more interesting classes in THST.",
    "Theater Studies 110 is a survey course of performance\/theater across cultures between 2000 BCE to 1800 BC. The workload averages two plays a week, and your section will devise a studio performance.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student if they are interested in THST as a major. However, there are better HU credits to take if that is what you're looking for.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have to for your major, but otherwise I suggest 111 for people interested in taking a dive into theatre because the things there are more contemporary and interesting than these lectures and their content.",
    "This is not a good class. It fails as a survey course-- you don't leave feeling like you can talk any more intelligently about theater overall, unless you're discussing the costumes in Japanese kabuki theater or something else very specific. It's just not well-taught. If you like theater but are on the fence about the theater major, steer clear. True, not taking 110 and 111 bars you from taking other, better classes, but unless your 100% sure you want to be a major it's not worth spending 1 of your 36 credits on. With a different professor, this could be a fascinating class. But as long as Dominika is teaching it, don't take it unless you have to.",
    "This might not be the course you expect it to be. This is not a high school theater class; this isn't performance-based, it focuses primarily on the theory and history of theater. The class is not the most engaging class you will take at Yale, but it provides an okay introduction to theater theory. You need to be serious about wanting to do theater to take this course because there is a lot of reading which you need to do to keep up and the course itself is not really engaging. Be forewarned: this class is not for the faint of heart.",
    "THST 110 is a descriptive survey of global styles of performance art. It spans multiple cultures and mediums of art, involving theater, dance, and music. It incorporates a lot of reading dense texts. The professor brings in a lot of experts in their field to speak, which keeps the course exciting. The course is definitely more of a theater history course than anything. It is a refreshing take on theater.",
    "This course has some fascinating material. I love the inclusion of non-Western theater traditions, and especially found the Japanese lectures fascinating. Professor Laster didn't seem especially comfortable lecturing, but she did get better as the semester progressed. Guest lectures were generally well done, with the comedia dell'arte lecture being a highlight. If you're a theater studies major, you have to take it, so take it. If not, there isn't anything I learned that I regret learning. I only regret we didn't have time to go more in depth."
