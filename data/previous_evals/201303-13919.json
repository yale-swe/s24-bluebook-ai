   "comments": [
    "It's an in-depth look at a particular school of Russian poetry.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Russian 689 01 for a fellow student. Besides covering a substantial portion of the reading list, it also makes early 20th century poetry accessible in a way few other courses do.",
    "I would recommend the course. The Symbolists can seem daunting to understand on your own, and I feel much better oriented in my understanding of early 20th century Russian poetry in general having taken the course. If anything, we should have more poetry courses offered in the department, here I allude to 19th century poetry, as we are currently supposed to train ourselves in these fields independently. I'm all for independent research and singularscholarly accomplishments, but for the young grad student, some guidance can do wonders.",
    "I would highly recommend it. The professor is excellent and makes a topic that most Slavic students are generally either fearful of or not particularly knowledgable about come alive and become accessible. A great way for novices of Russian poetry to become acquainted with the major ideas and works of the symbolists.",
    "I would describe the class as a very discussion based survey of Symbolist poetry. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend taking this course not only for students in the Slavic Dept. but for also for students in Comparative Literature. The selection of materials offers a broad interdisciplinary perspective and contextualizes Russian Symbolism within similar artistic movements in Europe. All in all, a great course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was a great way to prepare for our exams, in addition to being a great course in its own right.",
    "I knew almost nothing about early 20th century Russian poetry, so this course absolutely deepened my knowledge of the discipline. Surprisingly, I believe that it was also help me in forming a dissertation topic. Overall, a wonderful course!",
    "This course has completely opened up an entirely new body of work to me, and I am excited to continue studying the writers we covered. Symbolism is no small subject to cover, and I think that Marijeta did a wonderful job of giving us the knowledge necessary to continue our studies in the field independently.",
    "It opened up new possibilities of including topics and works from the canon I never thought of including in my dissertation research, this will help broaden the appeal of my research and better connect me to the field of Slavic studies. Moreover, I was instructed in topics that will appear on departmental exams which would have been very difficult to learn on my own.",
    "I believe that all the students in the course were able to pursue their broader research interests, although no one was specifically interested in Russian poetry at the start of the class."
