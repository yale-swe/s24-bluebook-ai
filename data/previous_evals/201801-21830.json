    "Learned a lot about the different ways that gender impacts a wide range of sectors of society, sometimes in surprising ways. Learned how to write a social science paper, too (but if you're looking for a WR credit, be warned that getting into a WR section isn't easy).",
    "I learned how to think like a sociologist and understand different causes behind human behaviors and problems.",
    "I learned a lot about how women are treated in society and how aspects of the economy and social norms impact women.",
    "This class was interesting and I liked learning about women in all fields.",
    "Critical eye toward gender politics in modernity! Think that it was very apparent that we should be thinking about power across many fronts and should decide an argument for ourselves. Loved the historical backgrounds that were given and the intersectional lenses.",

    "None.",
    "This class was so relevant! I loved going to lecture and learning about the different topics!",
    "I learned a lot that I think about now on the daily as a woman!",
    "In this class, I learn a lot about different economic, political, and \"biological\" arguments explaining differences between men and women in society. The economic and political ones seemed well though out and insightful, so I'm happy I learned about those.",

Understanding of mechanisms behind these differences. Use of three lenses: economics, biology, power. Skills: analysis of ambiguous data and competing explanations \/ hypotheses to draw conclusions. Use of multiple lenses. Writing a social science paper. Insights: Women are out of political power mainly due to the demographic constraint of being \"like us\" - married with kids. Women in the highest positions of power might overcompensate due to a the iron lady explanation. Parental uncertainty is a motivator for male action and might explain a lot, like jealousy, lack of paternal leave. Lack of paternal leave is primary cause of wage gap. Policy solutions are not one-size-fit-all and have unintended consequences. Porn and prostitution should be completely legal.",
    "feminism! lots of life knowledge",

    "A good grasp on gender studies and political views on sex and markets.",
    "A keen insight on political science and its relationship with sex and markets.",
    "This was a good survey course about the state of gender inequality.

It did teach me some \"political science literacy\" in terms of describing and identifying phenomena that I had previously known to exist but did not understand in an academic context.",
    "This course provided three analytical lenses (Sex, Markets, Power) to analyze a variety of topics, including gender inequality, prostitution, politics, and a diverse set of themes.",
    "I understand the complicated interplay of gender equality with biological, economic, and political factors.",

    "Hands down, the best poli sci lecture at Yale! The class challenged the way I thought about sexism in politics, in the workforce, and society at large.",
    "I learned a lot about the various mechanisms and structural institutions which disadvantage women in society. I also learned quite a bit of history.",
    "I learned a framework for approaching issues of gender and how to think about these issues from a variety of perspectives.",
    "Fascinating course, and I learned a lot about how markets and political systems affect women in the United States. Professor Rosenbluth is awesome and remembers a lot of her students' names. Would highly recommend.",
    "Excellent class! This course teaches you how to think about the origins of gender disparities from the biology, market, and power lenses. This class gives you the information you need to make your own opinion and teaches you to think critically about it",
    "Deeper understanding of womens rights, nuanced discourse on pertinent\/relevant discussions that involve equality and inclusion",
    "How to apply a gender lens to various issues, and especially how gender works in nuanced ways along social, political, and economic lines.",
    "This class helped me examine several arguments and issues of pertinence in society, and among many communities today, from the three major lenses of the course: biology, economics\/markets, and power (social and political). From hunter-gatherer societies to the highly globalized market economies we see today, the course truly gave a comprehensive look at women's status and social norms over time and across an international context. Touching upon core issues like the female vote, bargaining power, constrained preferences, development and female rights, and more, the course pushed me to really look beyond my gut instincts regarding these topics.",

    "This course was an excellent overview of political science as it applies to gender inequities.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the challenges that women face and what are the sources of these challenges.",
    "Great overview of the changes in the US landscape regarding the economy and female involvement.",
    "I learned a great deal about gender, race, and class both in the United States and worldwide - this class, of course, focused on gender in particular. Viewing these topics from the three lenses of biology, economy, and politics was eye-opening, as it revealed much of what takes place in our world today. I learned a great deal from this course",
    "I learned a lot about how women have gotten to be where they are today, throughout history and through the three different lenses in this class. I now can think critically about feminist dialogues and debates and women in modern society, and can now confidently engage in conversations with actual facts and arguments to back up my opinion. I have talked more about this class and what I've learned from it than any other course this semester.",
    "I learned a lot about the gender disparity that exists between men and women in three different perspectives",
    "I learned how to evaluate economic, social, and political issues through the lens of gender",
    "I loved this course! By far the most relevant, interesting, and engaging class I have taken at Yale. Raises so many issues that ar crucial for any student at Yale, not only women, to be aware of.",
    "I learned how to read quantitative studies in a social science class and be able to understand key take-aways. Further, I now understand more about the biological, economic, and power frameworks of sex.",
    "I learned how to understand and pull out the main argument from scientific articles",
    "I learned how the three lenses... biology, economics, and politics, are intertwined and all effect one another.",
    "I learned a lot about how women have been discriminated against in society throughout history, and potential ways of remedying the situation. The class made me think about a lot of issues I never considered.",
    "This was a great class! Professor Rosenbluth is a wonderful professor and you learn a lot about looking at gender inequality through different lenses.",
    "Learned so much about gender and the REAL world. I loved this class so much",
    "I learned about how certain norms and attitudes towards women have developed and prevailed in society. I also learned how the structure of the economy affects women and their economic prospects.",
    "Really incredible course on gender and its role in the world. Nice historical framework to discuss current issues.",
    "Synthesising info and the dynamic of how women are screwed over which is valuable to know in life",
    "I learned a lot about gender in markets and just overall in the working world! I learned of explanations for things that I always wondered about, like the wage gap.",
    "Look at a wide range of issues from biology to politics to economics to social norms and their effects on women's subjugation through time",
    "A larger knowledge and understanding of why men and women arent equal and where it stems from.",

    "i learned an interdisciplinary approach to gender inequality but not an intersectional or nuanced approach to gender inequality",
    "more understanding of the power dynamics that exist in society",
    "I learned to critically evaluate the dynamics of markets and gender. This class was incredibly interesting and relatable to everyday life.",
    "I know a lot more about myself, as a woman and the tendencies that I have towards this society.",
    "I learned a lot about how politics and economics connect and how women fit into those spheres. It also helped me tie in my knowledge about biology to these things and how what we \"know\" and \"biology\" influence social norms and affect women, men politics and economics.",
    "I am able to look at controversial topics from the biological, market and power lens to understand why different problems were created and why they still persist in today's society. I think this class gives a great deep explanation for why there are different inequalities in different parts of the world, which is eye-opening.",

    "writing and analyzing about gender studies",
    "How to look at a debate and see multiple sides",

This class offers three broad lenses biology, economics, and politics to approach these questions and understand their roots in our institutions, traditions, and even our brains. Specifically, I learned about the neoclassical economic model of Becker and what it predicts about specialization in the workforce and in families, and critiques of that model; I learned about the differences in political economy between liberal market economies and coordinated market economies, and how these institutional differences impact whether women do better in the public or private sectors; I learned about evolutionary instincts like paternity uncertainty and minimal parental investment in offspring and learned how to apply those concepts to our current world; and I learned how to apply these different \"lenses\" to hot-button issues like abortion and prostitution.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths of the course were the extra credit quizzes during section. Weaknesses were that everything felt very surface level. The course was on white feminism. The professor only spend one class period talking about race, class, and gender effects on women in the labor market, and that is super important.",
    "Readings are pointless and most of them are not good. Like, the research design. Sometimes there is no external validity, so I wonder what is the point if we don't even talk about or discuss them. We might do it in section, but we could use our time in a better way reading better studies, or if we discussed in class their validity.",
    "Strengths: interesting material covered by a brilliant professor Weaknesses: a lot of people take this as a gut, so section can be a little dull",
    "Very interesting course",
    "Amazing course. Every single lecture was completely engaging and eye-opening, Great job of covering a broad base of material while also achieving some depth.",
    "the readings were very boring and long",
    "Thought that the lectures were superb. Loved having the quizzes as a check-in during section for extra credit! Wish there were more writing sections! I know a lot of people that wanted to take this course for a WR credit that did not get in but would have really benefitted from the process of writing an empirical paper.",
    "This course was interesting at times, but the lectures were a bit disorganized and I would often get lost during them. I wish we had gone into greater depth on a few topics, rather than trying to cover so many different ones in such a short period of time.",
    "I feel that the strengths of this class was that professor Rosenbluth really made sure that she fully explained each point and that everyone understood it.",
    "Would not change a thing!",
    "Strengths: well organized and enlightening lectures. Weaknesses: too much focus on memorizing the names of research paper authors. would have loved to delve deeper into their arguments and not just their names and theses.",
    "Only strengths!",
    "I really enjoyed lecture, but felt that section was unstructured.",
    "weakness = WR students did not have access to test material strength = good sections, quizzes",
    "Strengths: Very interesting material, and Frances presents it very well. Weaknesses: Not many.",
    "This course's strength was Frances and her engagement with the topics. She always came into class ready to talk about anything and everything that was going on in the world and in the class lecture.",
    "great class",
    "The course content was very interesting, but I found some of the lectures to solely be based on the content\/words shown in the powerpoint presentations. I also wish section time was more structured.",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures and readings. Weaknesses: lecture was huge, classmates not really engaged, especially in section.",
    "lectures could be more clear...",
    "Slides were hard to follow sometimes, didn't really seem to connect or flow. But the information was really interesting.",
    "I like how Professor Rosenbluth posted the slides on Canvas because sometimes games made us miss the class or she would go fast in certain places and it was nice to be able to go back and look at the slides. Also the pictures helped with learning.",
    "This course was not well organized at all. While the topics were cool and I WANTED to be interested, I felt so disengaged. There were a lot of tangents and a lack of clear points.",
    "It was great! The only issue is that the exams are very long and there was lots to write.",
    "I think that the material itself is interesting, but the slides are not clear, and the readings are sometimes too long given what we are supposed to take from them.",
    "This course offered a strong survey, but I do not feel it focused enough on women in the lower classes.",
    "The class has very interesting material, but was carried out very poorly. Lectures were unorganized, and dragged on too far at times.",
    "This course could really use a weekly assignment which gauges students' level of engagement. This could come in the form of a reading response. A strength of this course was its generous time-allotment for assignments.",
    "Excellent course, no complaints except maybe having more interaction throughout the semester in the lectures.",
    "Great overview for someone who hasn't had much exposure to gender studies.",
    "I felt I learned very little in this course.",
    "Lectures could be more interesting.",
    "great class and gut",
    "Strengths are its connection to modern issues and how it connects to young people Weaknesses are its too repetitive at times",
    "The course offers a sneak peak into a wide variety of topics but doesn't exactly explore each one at a deep level. Right when I feel like I want to learn more about an issue, we change to a new (and equally interesting) topic. Section was helpful for going deeper, but I think that more can be done to stimulate further engagement with the material.",
    "Amazing course, amazing lecturer",
    "absolutely loved this class!! highly recommend!!",
    "This class has the potential to be very interesting in telling, but the class is essentially the same information repeated over and over. Additionally, this class barely covers the basic, top-layer of issues. There was little to no in-depth focus. Oh, and the class is EXTREMELY heteronormative. There was only one reading regarding LGBTQ+ individuals, and it was rarely mentioned in class.",
    "This class is large, and the lectures are interesting. The topics covered are really amazing, and it's really nice that Professor Rosenbluth addresses the readings that she assigns. A weakness is that the reading assigned is not reflective or what Professor Rosenbluth wants us to know from the material (sometimes she'll assign 50 pages and in summary, she emphasizes a paragraph). Also, the review sessions held by the teaching fellows honestly just seem like an ego contest between Law students as opposed to a helpful time for us to learn and review material.",
    "good lectures that were pertinent to the exams, but sections weren't as useful",
    "The course seemed to meander but included a lot of important information about gender disparities throughout the world. It wasn't always clear how we were comparing different countries' or areas' approaches, though.",
    "The material of the course was really engaging and I learned more than I originally thought I would, and I think this class is important for anyone that wants to understand inequality and gender dynamics. However, I thought the course did not have an overall trajectory that made it easier to tie together concepts, it felt as though some topics did not fit an overall message or theme.",
    "I enjoyed the course.",
    "Professor Rosenbluth is exceptionally well versed in the material and approaches it in a clear and accessible way. However, I did think some of the topics we investigated were less rigorous. The incels reading and the women in warfare seems particularly insubstantial whereas Gustavsson and Ross were much better.",
    "It was quite broad which was difficult when trying to write my policy paper",
    "Strengths - very engaging material Weaknesses - felt like there was a range of discussion section experiences across TFs",
    "It is a very important and interesting topic. Many of the issues tackled in the class were very relevant. The problem is that most of it felt very abstract and inaplicable to our own lives (e.g. how to balance worklife and homelife as a woman who intends to pursue a demanding career).",
    "Strengths: the information was taught in a very straightforward and engaging way. The information covered such a broad spectrum and many different topics but they were all related to each other.",
    "Professor Rosenbluth is definitely a highlight of the course; she is so brilliant and obviously cares a lot about her students. I liked that section really thoroughly reviewed and extended what we learned in lecture, and I liked that the readings were very clearly tied into lectures and applied to real life. I would say that the course could benefit from a more comprehensive wrap-up at the end because it felt like we left a lot of loose ends untied, with a lot of problems and competing solutions left on the table without a clear reckoning between them. I also think that the writing sections could benefit from some other form of assessment before the final since we came into it without prior experience with the format.",
    "I really liked the readings for this course, and you definitely learn a lot if you choose to put in the work. The experience does depend a lot on what section\/TA you get, but lectures are interesting and engaging",
    "I think the sections should either not be mandatory or should be treated more seriously. I didnt really understand the point of section.",
    "Enjoyed the syllabus format. Wish the PowerPoints had more text instead of photos, or at least better labeled photos. Material can sometimes be confusing because the stuff on the screen can be different from or unrelated to what the professor is saying. Reading quantity and quality are all good.",
    "I think this course was overall a great survey of our gendered society through the lenses of biology, economics, and power.",
    "You learn a lot. Section should be factored into your grade bc we have to go and there are pop quizzes",
    "The TFs for this class were an unmitigated disaster. I heard conflicting answers from various TFs. Many had no background in the material.",
    "I thought the course was taught well but more clarifications on tricky subjects would be appreciated.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it covers so many topics in a short amount of time.",
    "This courses material is interesting and the course is not challenging but it was disorganized and the width came at the cost of depth. None of the topics were deeply or critically engaged with and every lecture included problematic generalizations and a monolithic point of view",
    "Strengths: good clear lecture, good use of each lens. Interesting topics. Improvements: Bit of a clearer through-line. Sometimes felt episodic, and topics came a bit out of order.",
    "It is incredibly flexible and allows for deep conversation. I truly learned so much from our long discussions. The assignments were also super engaging and fascinating. At this moment in time, I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "The course materials was very fascinating, and I loved lectures. However, the course moved it a bit too fast.",
    "Lectures were very engaging and fast-moving!",
    "While a good concept with some interesting readings, I often felt like the lectures were disjointed from one another and that any deep analysis or synthesis I came away from the course actually came from the process of writing the the series of three papers required for the WR-intensive credit. I don't feel like there was a ton of incentive for people to take the course and its material seriously, which made it so much less interesting and rewarding a class than it had the potential to be.",
    "The first half or third of the course is laying the groundwork for the rest of the course, where the lenses are applied to different topics, making the latter part of the course a lot more engaging and interesting. There didn't seem to be a lot of connections between the lectures, and even within individual lectures they could be discombobulated.",
    "This is a really solid course--super interesting material, great lecturer, and low workload.",
    "Strengths - so applicable and relevant! As I learned more and more, I saw teachings from this course pop up in my daily life more and more. Class itself was also an enjoyable and fun experience. Weaknesses - at times, it felt like lectures moved a bit too slowly, or were too redundant.",
    "More examples later in the course but otherwise well balanced.",
    "The strengths of this course have to do with its relevance to the issues in American politics and society today. No weaknesses! All topics are interesting.",
    "Lectures were Too informal",
    "The strengths were its set-up as a large lecture. Its only weakness is that it failed to cover the role of gender non-binary people.",
    "I think there could be more direction to lectures and it would be helpful to always have the concepts tied back to the overall themes so we can see it all coming together.",
    "It should have been explained during shopping period that the paper requirement was actually a research paper. Describing it as three 5 page papers -- though true -- was misleading.",
    "Strengths: strongly and clearly presented lectures. They were focused and extremely concise. Weaknesses: none, honestly",
    "Strengths: distills material into tangible takeaways, strong lectures, interesting readings, manageable workload Weaknesses: too much material for final exam, bad final exam review",
    "The professor is great and the sections were great as well. There isn't much incentive to do the readings but they are interesting.",
    "For me, the strengths of the class were in the readings, lectures, and discussion sections. I thought the readings provided a great overview of what the following lecture would be about and the lectures themselves were incredibly informative. Furthermore, I liked how discussion sections provided an opportunity to delve deeper and discuss many of the controversial, or at least thought-provoking, topics of the class and some were even structured in creative ways to push us to think deeper (i.e. having us represent different lens, coming up with policy solutions, etc.). As for a weakness, I just wished that some of the readings were greater discussed in lecture.",
    "This course taught interesting information and was strong in that it followed a comprehensive syllabus that aided in learning. Sometimes it felt repetitive, however.",
    "Horrible class overall, taught at a 5th grade level to the point where it is actually more difficult if you have background knowledge in science, economics, etc.",
    "This is a very intro level lecture which means you cannot get into too many things in detail. This class also targets people who have little knowledge in gender theory because it overlooks some of the interesting gender theory questions which could be brought into this course.",
    "I loved the way this course was structured because it emphasized the interesting material, first and foremost. There were no extraneous, pointless assignments, and everything assigned served a thoughtful purpose.",
    "The course followed a very clear narrative with its lectures. It was occasionally a bit slow in its pace.",
    "Strengths include easy to follow slides and lectures. Weaknesses include very dense readings with little guidance on what is important in terms of grading.",
    "This course could be improved by updating the class on sex on campus.",
    "The writing section students aren't really set up well for the final.",
    "Great professors and topic coverage.",
    "The class honestly was very solid - whether taking it as a HU or WR credit, I imagine it would be good either way. Speaking to the WR credit, it was a perfect writing credit - three 5 page essays and a final. The lecture was helpful and educational; the sections dug more deeply into lecture material, supplemented it with readings, and discussed at length relevant topics. Although it was a bit tough preparing for the final after having no previous exposure to test-taking in the course, this was a small issue compared to the overall strengths of the course.",
    "Strength: Lectures are engaging and easily digested. Section is very informative. The exams test you on knowledge you know and aren't out to trick you. Really a great class geared toward effective and efficient learning. Weakness: Just that it is so large.",
    "Taught well, but powerpoints can be made better",
    "I think this course tried to cover too much. It is extremely interesting material and I found that not enough attention was paid to each topic.",
    "I found the wide range of topics interesting, but I wish the course was more organized in a way that distinguished the lenses from on the another.",
    "I felt like the content of the course could have been more streamlined. But overall, there were far more strengths than weaknesses. Professor Rosenbluth is amazing and the content she teaches is as well.",
    "So many strengths to this course, but a couple weaknesses would be the essay we had to write was kind of weird and some of the topics\/readings were unclear and unnecessary.",
    "I really enjoyed this course the way it was.",
    "The lectures were very engaging, but I thought it was often difficult to understand the minutia of certain readings, especially scientific methods and mathematical modeling. Perhaps more explanation of the graphs in class and in the readings could have aided our understanding of the readings and material. Further, I did not think the pop quizzes were that helpful to our learning, given that I never got mine back and only received a grade a few weeks before the final.",
    "I thought it was done extremely well- it was my favorite class",
    "I loved how it was taught and actually learned from\/enjoyed section but I didn't like how subjective the grading was.",
    "THIS COURSE IS WHITE FEMINISM IN ACTION, lacks a serious level of intersectionality and should really be altered.",
    "Strengths are the subject material and Professor Rosenbluth's teaching. Weaknesses are the size of the lecture and the variance among TAs.",
    "Great class, but I took it writing credit and I wish there was more tie in between what was taught in class and what the papers were about.",
    "I LOVED THIS class do not change it at all",
    "The course definitely has very interesting material. However the structure of the class isn't the best. The lecture slides would either be overloaded with information and it would be hard to either focus on what Professor Rosenbluth was saying or what to write down. Additionally, there were many readings assigned where it could be pretty long but only one paragraph from it was relevant to class.",
    "Great lecturer one of my favorite at Yale and super engaging",
    "I really liked the professor and my TA. I also really liked the material. I wish that more people could have taken it as a writing credit.",
    "I enjoyed the scope of the course but sometimes found the themes of individual classes weren't entirely tied together as well as they could have been.",
    "The sections are interesting, but the lectures could be more engaging.",
    "I found it frustrating that the WR sections were assigned a data analysis paper with absolutely no instruction or guidance as to how to perform a data analysis paper.",
    "Very engaging material but some figures and slides were outdated.",
    "good lectures and TAs",
    "I think that this course gives a decent overview of differing opinions concerning gender equality, and tries to present differing viewpoints concerning various gender issues to create a holistic image of women's economic positions in various societies. I personally feel like it could be improved by expanding the singular lecture on race and incorporating it more generally into the class, because there were many times where I felt that this topic could have been addressed in other lectures and was conceptually ignored in areas where it could have fit in well. By the end of the course I felt that the class had become a little bit repetitive.",
    "I think the lenses approached some very interesting conversations, but it sometimes felt as if the readings were a bit outdated.",
    "this course would benefit from being narrowed down... would be good for someone with no knowledge of feminism but also could mislead them to believe they have a comprehensive understanding",
    "poor unorganized lectures, interesting readings",
    "Awesome class overall! Very relatable and understandable.",
    "It's too big. I think discussion sections could be more geared towards organic discussions rather than strictly focusing on the readings.",
    "I liked it a lot. No complaints. I think it is up to the individual to be engaged with the course. All of the resources are there.",
    "The readings were great. Lecture was good, slides are clear and so if prof Rosenbluth. Not much to improve.",
    "Strengths of the course were that we learned the basic concepts during the first half of the semester so that when we discussed more \"hot topics\", like abortion and pornography, we understood the different lens arguments clearly.",
    "I like the set up lecturewise of the course, and the topics were interesting.",
    "trying not to write subjectively",
    "Sominteresting! Went a little fast",
    "This course is a good overview of gender inequality primarily in the United States but it could benefit from fewer generalizations and blanket statements and more nuance.",
    "Interesting material but often lacked cohesive flow in the presentation. Graphs were not labelled and neither were their axes and thats always annoying.",
    "Some solid readings, but some lecture topics need to be refined more",
    "This is a great course.",
    "Strengths: material is pretty interesting. Readings are fairly varied in nature and topic. Weaknesses: class is very easy. Not much learning is required to succeed. Concerningly low amount of attention on what SHOULD happen (normative) opposed to what does happen.",
    "I wish there was a less liberal bias on the entire class. I understand that feminism is inherently liberal, but it doesn't have to be. Teach with arguments for the other side as well.",
    "Strengths of this course are section and Prof. Rosenbluth is very nice and lectures are interesting. Weaknesses are the lack of assignments results in your grade coming from very few things and each assignment counts a lot",
    "The course was very interesting without being high commitment. Lecture and section were very enjoyable. A great course to take as an underclassman or as a 5th class; however, depending on who your TF was, the course was very different. Some TFs did a great job guiding discussions and helping your section understand what material was salient to the exams. Other TFs let the students dictate the discussions during section which I did not find helpful in understanding the key points to the readings. Regardless, I would recommend the course if you are even vaguely interested in women in the workforce.",
    "It's just kind of white feminism, and while interesting, doesn't really address how sex, markets, and power are inextricably woven into systems of racism and colonialism.",
    "Strengths were section and readings, weakness was lecture",
    "If you take this as a writing credit, be very careful. Because you don't take the midterm (instead write 3 4-5 page papers), you will find yourself studying for an entire semester's worth of material a few days before the final. This was extremely difficult and those who took this class without the writing credit definitely had a leg up in this way, because they had already studied half of the material in-depth, and knew the format of the test\/test-taking strategies.",
    "It teaches a lot of concepts behind gender discrimination and is very informative. However, sometimes the lectures were a bit boring. The class with the clickers were very interactive and I think adding more of that would really benefit the level of engagement in class.",
    "Strengths include Professor Rosenbluth (she is a great teacher and completely dedicated to her students -- even in a large lecture class) and the overall applicability of the material. This is a really important class to take, I think, and it was the sort of class that naturally started conversations outside of class. (I ended up talking with a friend in the class about something Professor Rosenbluth talked about just about every time afterwards. That's a sign of a good class.) The class does a good job of mixing broad theories with more pointed applications of those theories. The overall approach of the class is strong\/well-organized: It first introduces the three lenses, and then it applies those in different ways to different instances of problems at the intersection of gender, biology, politics, and economics. In terms of weaknesses, I think the readings could be better incorporated into class and section. There wasn't great consistency in terms of which readings ended up being really important in class and which were tangential. This sometimes made section less helpful\/illuminating than it could have been.",
    "Professor Rosenbluth is one of the best professors you'll have at Yale. She cares so much about what she teaches, and she also cares a lot about her students. After taking this class, I feel much more educated about why gender inequality exists and the challenges that females continue to face in our world today. I also appreciated that the class took into consideration biological, economic, and political lenses when talking about these different challenges- Professor Rosenbluth literally starts at the beginning, from a biological standpoint, in asking how exactly males and females are biologically different. She then moves on to consider various topics like the gender wage gap, female political representation, women and development, and female participation in the workforce, all through these various lenses. I left many lectures with something new to think about and discuss with my friends.",
    "Amazing professor, very helpful sections, good lecture formats, fair exams! No major weaknesses.",
    "Strengths- interesting material. Weaknesses- really strange lecture slides, hard to study from.",
    "I felt this course was really interesting and the TAs and the professor were very kind. I did feel that some of the readings were too long and boring. I think there were some readings that could have been summarized briefly in lecture rather than made into required reading.",
    "I really enjoyed my section leader Bethany Linton. I thought the topics were broad enough that the discussions flowed well in the discussions.",
    "Topics are interesting\/easy to follow, but really only ever cover anything on the surface level so lectures can be difficult to sit through.",
    "Tests were not really great",
    "Sometimes the ideas\/slideshow presentation order and organization was unclear--slightly misleading at times, and sometime claims did not seem well supported. Overall, this was not a significant issue but can be improved.",
    "strengths - intersting balance of politics\/econ\/gender theory. but.... really really broad\/barely any specificity",
    "The course was strong in providing a lot of information and relevant readings, however it did have a tendency to move quickly through major points of interest or very relevant issues in order to cover all of the material.",
    "I thought the class did a great job of providing nuanced perspectives on information\/topics that students might've learned about in other courses (abortion, wage inequality, prostitution, etc). However, the class suffers greatly from its emphasis on heteronormativity and lack of intersectionality. Whenever we discussed the experiences of women who weren't white and European or American, it felt like a diversion from the \"main\" material. There shouldn't be a single lecture on race and class. Race\/ethnicity, religion, class, sexuality, and ability should be incorporated into EVERY lecture because all of these factors are essential to the lifestyles and experiences of women around the world. I also felt that some important historical information was inappropriately distilled. Accuracy shouldn't be sacrificed for succinctness.",
    "Strengths were the in class discussion with good supported readings. No weaknesses"

    "No.",
    "Yes. One of the most relevant and thought provoking classes I have taken at Yale. I think everyone should take it because it is not stressful but always interesting.",
    "It is not a gut. The exams are graded very hard... You def need to put a reasonable amount of effort if you want a good grade. Amazing credit\/D though!",
    "yes, made me think about gender in a whole new way.",
    "For sure -- especially as a straight cis white man, this was an eye-opening course.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Very interesting and something you wouldnt otherwise learn about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a friend because the material is very interesting and class is enjoyable.",
    "Yes, 100%! It is a fascinating, rewarding course.",
    "yes!",
    "YES. Take this and educate yourself. Gives a broad overview of female power, economics and biology internationally. If you put in the work, you will absolutely walk away thinking about something differently!",
    "Definitely a good Credit\/D option....not necessarily an easy A, but if you try you can do fairly well!",
    "Yes, I found the topics we discussed very interested and relevant to the inequality women are trying to reduce now.",
    "Absolutely take this class! So many important things to learn from it.",
    "Yes! Great lecture class to take with friends.",
    "Yes, take this course. It is not much work and very beneficial.",
    "Yes, I thought that the course was very engaging.",
    "Yes!",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to everyone. You'll be much more educated on gender inequality issues and will have a solid understanding of what impacts women's position.",
    "Yes. There's a reason so many people always take it, and that's because it covers a lot of interesting topics.",
    "Great class, I definitely recommend taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in learning more about how gender equality is viewed from a market and power lens. I found the material very interesting and relevant to today's issues.",
    "This class is what you make of it. If you go to lecture, do the readings, and participate in section, you'll actually learn a lot. If you do none of those things -- and many people don't -- then you won't really get much out of it.",
    "Yes!!!!!! Professor Rosenbluth is awesome!!!! take it and learn a lot of interesting material!!!!",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "If you want an easy lecture, sure. But if you want to be engaged with the material and look forward to class, no.",
    "Yes! It's so fantastic and you'll learn so much. I genuinely enjoyed lectures and section, and had so much fun writing my final paper (and even studying for the final with friends.)",
    "This class is fine. Not great, but interesting.",
    "This course does a good job of highlighting important features of the world at large, and introduces students to important topics relating to all genders.",
    "No. It may not be difficult, but it is frustrating to sit through poorly organized lectures. Section is much more useful.",
    "Yes -- if that student is interested in gender's role in society.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to take a course in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. A lot of the material is very relevant to issues we have today.",
    "Yes",
    "No.",
    "Yes",
    "yes",
    "Maybe if theyre extremely interested in the issue, but dont know much going in.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. But you have to take it seriously to really get something out of it. It is a waste of time if you're just looking for a gut and don't actually want to do the work. If you take it, definitely do the readings and go to lecture. It is worth it.",
    "Yes; you will learn so much. The way I think about gender discrimination around the world and the workplace have changed forever.",
    "yes!! extremely interesting lectures and work assignments",
    "Probably not, but people are going to take it anyways. It is a relatively easy Poli Sci \/ SC credit. The readings are optional, and lectures are very easy to follow. But do not take this class expecting to learn much information.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who was interested in learning more about women in history. It is a really interesting class with a lot of information and fields to cover.",
    "yes; course material was interesting and well taught",
    "I'd recommend it with the caveat that, if you're taking it as a fifth class or in general a course you won't prioritize, credit\/d it. Much of this information is common knowledge but there are detailed readings and discussions (that relate to assignments), all of which require some preparation and time. Professor Rosenbluth is wonderful.",
    "Yes, would recommend. Pretty easy. Lectures are interesting, so are readings.",
    "Absolutely. You get some very good tradeoffs with this course. Light readings, interesting lectures and good sections. A few bad\/uninteresting topics but largely very solid course.",
    "Yes, it is an important and good introduction to the economic, biological and social commentary on gender relations.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend. Interesting material. Definitely much more work in the writing section, but overall positive experience.",
    "It was overrated. Relies too heavily on the readings, which were far too dense. Felt innaplicable to our lives. Was all very abstract.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if you are not a political science major, the class is extremely interesting and worth taking as a social science or writing class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to debate social and ethical issues and challenge their boundaries in certain areas such as contraception, abortion, and gay marriage.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is super relevant and interesting, and Professor Rosenbluth is really great. For a WR, there are only three short papers plus the final, so the workload is totally manageable. My TA (Akhil) was really helpful, and so section was very useful for review of anything that was unclear in lecture. I would say as long as you go to class, it is not hard to do well.",
    "Would definitely recommend. I learned a lot about why gender policies differ around the world and what structures gender relations today",
    "Yes, but not a strong yes. Interesting for the average person at times. Could be very cool if this is the kind of subject matter that really interests you. Your experience is also dependent on the TA you get and whether or not you're in the writing sections.",
    "No.",
    "Yes but I think the final was worth too much and the IDs on the midterm and final were graded pretty harshly.. I thought I knew the material well and didnt do well. It would have been nice for section to be worth something.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Professor Rosenbluth (and her TAs) are committed to undergraduate teaching. I have taken many great lectures at Yalebut this one exceeds them all. The material is well-organized and thoughtfully curated. Just the right amount of readings and assessments. However, the real strength lies in the instructors insistence that students understand the main themes and have access to everything they need (readings and PowerPoint presentations are neatly up on the Canvas syllabus). Take the course!!!",
    "If you want a gut class, this class has a light workload and is graded easily. It also presents some insightful analyses of gender inequality from an economic lens. However...This class is incredibly cisheteronormative, a very large portion of this class is basically essentiallizing gender based on biological characteristics. This class also just about ignores both the social construction of gender and intersectionality. So if any that bothers you (which it should), this is not a good class for you.",
    "Absolutely! Super interesting and a class that everyone should take",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures. Professor Rosenbluth was great. But the TFs for this course seemed fairly randomly chosen. Many had no background in the material. I heard numerous complaints from classmates about how horrible their TFs were. The grading was sporadic and was often vindictive. This is was no fault of the professor because the class was massive. I would recommend the class if the TF situation was improved or section was cut.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class if someone is interested in learning about what causes disadvantages for sexes in the labor market. I think this was a key takeaway.",
    "yes!!!",
    "Yes I would.",
    "Definitely take this course. I enjoyed taking the writing version. Very good stuff to know; reasonably unbiased and objective in the presentation of the material.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes, definitely. Any student who is interested in compliance-work, economics, finance, corruption in general should take this course.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "A good fifth class. For the WR-intensive, not actually as easy a writing class as it purports to be, since the three 5-paged papers are more like three 8-10paged papers. Definitely low workload, but probably not the best class if a) you already know something about gender inequality besides the most basic or b) you're looking for difficult, academically stimulating material.",
    "I took this course in hopes of learning about feminism and feminist theory from a normative perspective, but was disappointed by a positive analysis of such theories. For example, when talking about female genital mutilation, I expected the reading and the professor to absolutely drag men, but instead, the suggestion was that men may not be actually be at fault. I honestly think this class made me more conservative in thinking. That being said, if you can sit through lectures where the professor just reads off the slides for 50 minutes and asks the whole lecture what they think of something while you wait in torturous silence, take this class.",
    "Yes!! Great fifth class\/chill option, and you'll learn a lot in the way you look at the world.",
    "Take this! Really applicable to real life and gets you thinking about a lot of things that will be very relevant for your near future (i.e. once you graduate and enter the real world). Makes a nice 5th credit.",
    "Take this as a 5th class credit D or as an easy gut.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to all students regardless of major. The knowledge you take away from this course will shape how you interpret and react to inequality in the world.",
    "I would recommend this class! Take it!!",
    "I would recommend this course as a big lecture which only really requires engagement around the time of the midterm and final. The paper is short and actually pretty fun to write.",
    "Yes, this is a really interesting class that is not too challenging. The readings are also very interesting.",
    "Fascinating course, and I learned a lot about how markets and political systems affect women in the United States. Professor Rosenbluth is awesome and remembers a lot of her students' names. Would highly recommend.",
    "Absolutely! I loved this course and I think everyone should take it even if you aren't a political science major or aren't usually interested in political science. The course gives you a survey of a myriad of issues and lets you dive deeper into whatever you are interested in. I love that Professor Rosenbluth looks at issues from each of the three lenses and lets you form your own opinion. I walked away feeling more informed about the origins of issues such as the gender wage gap, prostitution, lack of women in government, etc.",
    "So glad I took this course. Almost graduated without having taken a WGSS course which wouldve been a huge mistake. This this, minimal workload and you learn a ton!",
    "Absolutely. Should honestly be required (or something similar) because of the level of analysis it employs to highlight how gender plays into everything.",
    "This class is something I think anyone must take, regardless of your gender. Though some classes may mash a few words together and come up with an intriguing title, SMP truly lives up to each aspect of its name. I really appreciated the cross-disciplinary approach of the class, as well as the international context of the issues we discussed. This is definitely a class I enjoyed discussing, even casually, with my friends and will provide something new to learn for everyone who takes it.",
    "Yes because it teaches information that is very worthwhile to know in the real world.",
    "Yes, the professor is awesome",
    "I think this course is a not hard interesting way to get exposed to a handful of different disciplines' perspectives on why females and males have differences in the modern era. I think this is worth taking as a first or maybe second year but there are much better classes if you want to dip into what it means to be a female or male through the WGSS department. This is not a very hard class (non-writing intensive) but as a senior who is interested in this stuff I did not get much out of it.",
    "Yes! It was incredibly interesting and thoughtful. Well-organized and well-executed.",
    "Definitely!",
    "If you haven't taken a WGSS course, take this.",
    "I would definitely commend this to any Yale student, regardless of major.",
    "This is a good course to gain a basic understanding of gender-based challenges. It by no means, however, is an in depth course. If you're wanting some depth on a particular issue, I suggest taking a more issue-specific class.",
    "Yes, take this course especially if you have an interest in female economic empowerment\/labor rights. It is also a great way to understand the sociopolitical landscape in the US and is good content for a potential thesis.",
    "Yes - not only is it educational and eye-opening just from a knowledge standpoint, it's also not too heavy a burden in terms of work, and it's a great course to take if looking to fill distributional requirements.",
    "Absolutely. I learned a ton that is applicable to my everyday life. I enjoyed lectures every day. The professor and TAs just really want to see you succeed. It's a great fifth class, or class to add on if you are taking a particularly difficult course load. I came away with so much.",
    "Yes its a great course",
    "Potentially. I feel that i learned a lot but that there was some misinformation and only students who have suffice to knowledge to critique the material should take this course.",
    "Yes, because it grants you a unique perspective on all issues in life",
    "This is the best class i have taken at Yale. If you are in to womens studies at all or even just looking to take a really fun course - this is the class for you",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I found the material fascinating. The paper at the end allowed students to explore any topic that they found the most interesting. I ended up writing 15 pages when the assignment was to write 5. Some of the material was common knowledge, but other parts allow you to understand certain facets of life in a totally new lens.",
    "Yes I think learning about the subordination of women in society and what caused it is vital to improving equality in the future",
    "Yes, I loved the course and felt like it was a great compliment to other courses I have taken since it combined a broad range of topics (economics, biology, and politics).",
    "Absolutely not, if a class is not intersectional then it completely excludes so many narratives and the language used when intersectionality and non heteronormative concepts was barely mentioned needs to be more thoughtful.",
    "Yes! This course was awesome",
    "Yes, I thought the class was very interesting and I think it is good to be exposed to new topics.",
    "Yes. Easy class and interesting.",
    "YES it is a must take. you need this for real-life info",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. The workload isn't too bad, and lecture is actually enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student but I would warn them it gets the most interesting at the end of the course because the class shifts from learning history and analyzing graphs to talking about more controversial topics from today like prostitution, abortion and pornography.",
    "Incredible class if you actually can manage to care even a little bit. Unfortunately, it was billed as a gut, so section - which had the potential to be really interesting - ended up being a little less stimulating than other courses. It's a real shame because these are incredible and topical topics and this course could have been a really great experience.",
    "Yes great course",
    "Yes!! Very interesting and engaging. I loved the topics.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in a broader survey course and the final paper was nice in its total flexibility",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn about why women are subordinated to men and where the root of current societal problems stem from.",
    "Interesting and enjoyable fifth class. Go to lecture, you will learn a lot from Professor Rosenbluth.",
    "Yes, very interesting",
    "I would only recommend this course as an introductory-level course since it doesn't really go into much depth in any area but rather, brushes on the surface of a variety of different issues. Since this lecture was trying to cover so much, it wasn't able to really go in depth with all of the topics discussed in the course. If a student has an interest in this topic, they should definitely take more classes on top of this lecture if they choose to take this class.",
    "Yes, I found this course to be extremely engaging. I learned a lot, it wasnt very well-taught, and the course load was totally manageable. I would highly recommend it.",
    "if they want a survey course to introduce themselves to gender inequality.. should be followed by subsequent seminars however",
    "definitely an interesting course that you don't need to put much work into",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes. Take this if you're a man, if you're a woman, if you don't identify with either. It's helpful in your daily life.",
    "Yes it was very interesting. It really opened my eyes to how the world works and gave me insightes few political sicence classes have thus far.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is comfortable with lectures and the formatting of political science exams.",
    "Yes, this class isnt high workload, but you learn some pretty interesting things if you go to lecture.",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely",
    "Honestly no but I didnt hav a great TF experience. With a different TF Im sure it was better.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, this is a good course for someone looking to fulfill the So credit with something chill.",
    "absolutely!!! A really interesting an important course, with a wonderful professor and supportive TAs. everyone should take.",
    "Interesting material taught in a fair and constructive way. Not necessary to go to every class but I often went just because each class actually has something for you to learn.",
    "Yeah, I would. Section can get super interesting if everyone engages, but I didn't have that so it was kind of a let down.",
    "Yes - this has been my favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "Yes, if they are searching for an easy, somewhat interesting gut",
    "Low workload and predictable midterm\/final. Getting a good graded is doable.",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend because the topics are interesting and very relevant",
    "I would recommend this course as it was a fun, valuable course in my Yale college experience.",
    "If you do the readings and have a good section, you can get a lot out of it. The baseline level of learning provided by lecture is a bit lacking though.",
    "Yes; if genuinely interested in gender roles in society",
    "Yes it provides interesting insight and perspective to gender quality not only in the work force but in life in general.",
    "Definitely take this class. After every lecture, I ended up having lunch with a friend who was also in the class, and most days we ended up having a long discussion about something that Professor Rosenbluth discussed in class. The material is extremely relevant to just about everything, especially in the current moment. This class teaches you the roots and explanations for a lot of the gender imbalances you see in the world and raises a lot of questions I didn't ever think about in terms of how to approach solving these problems. Professor Rosenbluth is a great and dedicated professor who always brings in connections to the current news. You shouldn't take this class because it has a reputation for being easy; you should take it for great material and a great professor.",
    "Absolutely. I thoroughly enjoyed this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! If you want to be more educated about gender inequality and why these differences and social norms exist at all, this class is very eye-opening and will make you think differently about it. The workload basically consists of the weekly readings and the five-page paper due at the end of the semester, so it's not a lot for the great wealth of knowledge you will have accumulated by the end of the class.",
    "Yes! This course makes you aware of systemic biases in the differences between genders, and why they happen! Biological, economic, social, etc.",
    "Amazing lectures. Would totally recommend. Fun, easy way to get the WR credit too.",
    "Take it for a WR credit, the lectures are honestly kind of strange sometimes and the slides look like 2007 word art. Overall interesting material but sometimes things that are really obvious. (gender inequality exists)",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning more about gender politics and the state of gender equality in the US and throughout the world today.",
    "Yes, I would because it opened my eyes on a lot of subjects that I had previously been aware of but never fully delved into.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you are looking to take a relatively laid back but very engaging class. I learned a lot about gender dynamics, which I think are important to our understanding of the contemporary world we navigate daily.",
    "Yes!",
    "The work is manageable and really good if you're looking for an easier social sciences credit, but don't be surprised if it gets boring.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, a great class that is not too challenging so will not overwhelm someone who wants to take this course for their own interest.",
    "Yea it's chill",
    "no. neoliberal bible of feminism.",
    "Yes, every student should have an awareness of the topics that this course covers, and the class itself is not overly taxing or stressful to take.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wanted to learn somewhat interesting material with a doable amount of work (I took the class non-writing, and there was a 5-page paper, midterm, and final). However, I was frustrated by heteronormativity and lack of intersectionality in the course, so I'd take that into account before deciding to take this class.",
    "I would recommend it to all students because I feel that the topics discussed in the class are ones that every student should be aware of."
