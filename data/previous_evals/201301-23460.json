   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you're interested in nature poetry. The syllabus is rich and there's a ton of potential for discussion. The papers are very open-ended, which means you can write about something you're excited about.",
    "Yes take it! Easy and interesting",
    "Connecting themes of perceiving nature across every era",
    "Very relaxed course. You are basically determining how much of the reading you want to do\/ how much you want to get out of it. A good 5th course, if you are interested in studying nature and like analyzing poetry.",
    "Yeah! Totally. It's not a perfect seminar, but the material is BEAUTIFUL and FUN, and Stefan is my favorite kind of professor: personable, creative, earnest. I learned a lot from him about scholarship: how to make it true, fun, and meaningful."
