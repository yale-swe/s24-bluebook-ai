    "Basic introductory microeconomics, although there was some macro stuff too.",
    "If you have taken micro in high school, this class provides little additional knowledge. If you have no econ experience, there is a lot you'll learn but keep in mind the class can sometimes move very fast. If it weren't for the fact that I had taken micro in high school, the class could have been gone poorly.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics.",
    "Learned about the basics of Economics as well as a solid foundation of how QR courses run at Yale.",
    "Developed some more quantitative understanding of economic decision making and markets, but it is an intro class, so not THAT much.",
    "Having never studied economics, this course introduced me to the suggest and I learned many things which I think are useful to know in life. The study of marginal analysis was new for me, and introduced me to a new way of thinking.",
    "I thought this course was a good introduction to the basics of microeconomics. I learned how to draw and interpret supply and demand graphs, and to think about how markets shift in response to monopoly situations, taxes, subsidies, and other modifications.",
    "Broad knowledge and understanding of basic supply and demand as well as other basic economic concepts.",
    "I learned many basic microeconomics concepts. I strengthened my graphing skills and learned to apply qualitative and quantitative analysis.",
    "I entered this course with no knowledge of economics at all and am now equipped with a solid foundation in microeconomics. I'm looking forward to taking further classes in the subject.",
    "I attempted to learn a lot about introductory microeconomics during this course.",
    "Intro microeconomics with a range of topics from supply\/demand to investment",
    "Learned how to think through the lens of microeconomics.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomic analysis, including topics like supply, demand, types of markets, and utility. The course involved a lot of algebra and graph-drawing. One of the more helpful skills I gained was applying economic topics to real-life situations.",
    "The basics of microeconomics, but only on a cursory level. Understanding the reasoning behind various equations was not generally a part of the lectures.",
    "I'm going to be an economic consultant for the next two years, so this course was EXTREMELY useful to me. It says a lot when half a semester of Yale economics can arm one with enough knowledge to land a stable job in the business world.",
    "Microeconomic concepts and implementing them into the real world.",
    "I learned that Professor Oster is a vegan.",
    "I learned the basic principles of microeconomics and feel prepared to take more advanced courses in the subject area.",
    "In this course, I learned the basics and nuances of Microeconomics with a bit of Macroeconomics, Development economics, and behavioral economics mixed in. I learned the intricacies of demand, supply, monopoly, oligopoly, price discrimination, and social welfare. I learned to look at the world with an economic lens, thinking about incentives to consumers and motivations of producers, and the opportunity costs of making a decision.",
    "I learned a solid, pretty standard foundation in mircoeconomics -- supply\/demand, perfect competition\/monopoly, oligpolies, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about the basic functions of the economy, and I gained a lot of insight from the course with regard to how certain things in our society function the way they do. I found it really interesting to be able to connect more theoretical concepts to real-world situations in which businesses and individuals make choices. The course also teaches you to think differently - you start thinking more how to value your own resources, whether that be your time, money, or anything else. A lot of lessons you learn from economics are 100% applicable in personal life (even apart from jobs, etc.). For example, a lot of people don't ignore sunk costs, which is one thing that taking econ will help with. It's just a really good class.",
    "I learned about the basics of microeconomics- supply and demand, many graphs, monopolies and competition. More than anything, I learned what economic thinking and modeling looks like.",
    "Basic microeconomic concepts and problem solving with graphs and algebra.",
    "By taking ECON 115, I learned all of the fundamental basics of microeconomics (supply and demand, externalities, public goods, budget constraints, monopolies, oligopolies, Pareto efficiency, etc.). I had taken AP microeconomics in high school, but this course went very far beyond the AP curriculum, so I was happy to learn new material (I would say I was only familiar with about 10% of the topics we learned in class this year having taken AP micro).",
    "I was given a broad overview of the field of microeconomics with specific emphasis on consumer theory, the theory of firm, allocative efficiency, market inefficiencies, and other topics. Many real world applications were presented to us which made the class feel practical and more interesting.",
    "I developed a better understanding of basic economic concepts including how firms make decisions, the impact of a tax on an individual's MWTP, and that marginal benefit is best suited to equal marginal cost.",
    "I learned how to understand the basic concepts of the economy such as supply, demand, elasticity, competitive markets, monopolies, as well as several theories that relate to these.",
    "In ECON 115 you gain an understanding of basic microeconomics processes, learning about consumer theory, producer theory, market structures and competition, externalities, and many other smaller topics.",

    "I learned about the fundamentals of economics and how to apply this conceptual knowledge to the real world.",
    "Foundations of microeconomics.",

    "Some basic microeconomics knowledge",
    "Basic theory of economics",
    "Basic understanding of intro micro, including more math than you would typically see in an AP course. (Very much recommend taking even if you've taken the AP!)",
    "Micro econ topics. MC=Md.",
    "New way of looking at world through economics; I now make all my decisions in life by weighing marginal benefit against marginal cost.",
    "I was introduced to microeconomics.",
    "I think this course helped me understand the basics of economics to a point that when I look at the world around me, I can analyze many economic phenomena in the same way we do in class. Sometimes our discussions of efficiency go past the fiscal world and more generally quantifies the benefit of different choices. I think it was applications like these that made me find a love for economics through this class.",
    "I was able to further explore and was introduced to new ways of thinking about decision making. Both from the perspective of society as well as individuals.",
    "I developed analytical skills and a better understanding of how the economy works.",
    "I gained skills in economic decision making, reasoning and analysis. I developed in this course through my ability to think differently and understand how firms, consumers and markets function economically in our society.",
    "A good broad overview of microeconomics. Covered certain things (Pareto effiency) which the TFs believed should not be introduced until intermediate",
    "Thourough understanding of the supply side of Econ and monopolies. I had a difficult time with demand partly due to the professor of the first half.",
    "I learned how to apply microeconomics theory to real world examples",
    "Intuitive thinking, quantitative reasoning",
    "By taking this course, I learned the basics of microeconomics, such as supply and demand, monopolists, and touched a little bit on behavioral economics.",
    "As my first STEM course at Yale, it was a learning curve in terms of figuring out how to learn in a large lecture hall supplemented by problem sets and section. I think I have gotten to a comfortable level in terms of this style of learning. In terms of course content, I think I have a rudimentary understanding of economics as it applies to individual consumers and markets.",
    "with a class of 300 people, almost nothing.",
    "Basic understanding of microeconomics including supply and demand, and different types of markets (competitive, monopolies and oligopolies)",
    "I learned about basic microeconomics, learned how to manipulate equations.",
    "I had never taken economics before so I received a very good baseline of information to apply to later economics.",
    "Learned how to think like an economist Exposed to a subject I knew nothing about prior to taking the class Understand how the markets work (generally) and how this applies to my everyday life",

    "Learned alot about markets, externalities, and supply and demand.",
    "I developed reasoning skills and was able to approach problems in a different way.",
    "Learned about the basic microeconomic model of supply and demand under perfect competition. I also learned about how the assumption of perfect competition is often challenged by the many industries which are subject to monopolies, duopolies, oligopolies. Finally, I learned about several topics such as behavioral economists, interest rates and savings, etc.",
    "I developed my ability to analyze an individual's choices in the market and predict what will happen based on certain circumstances.",
    "Basic econ. How consumers and producers make decisions based on their budget and preferences and the basics of how different types of markets function.",
    "fundamental knowledge of microeconomic principals.",
    "I learned some basic economic concepts. The biggest lesson I took away from the course, however, was probably how to teach myself material. Neither lecture nor section did a good job really teaching the subject, and I often had to use outside or old resource to learn the content.",
    "I developed the ability to think from an economical standpoint.",
    "I got a good base of Econ knowledge",
    "I learned microeconomics concepts.",
    "I learned about markets and supply\/demand concepts.",
    "I gained a lot of new knowledge in this course. Having never really taken any economics before, I learned a lot about how individual markets and firms work on a basic level. It's made me more efficient in my use of time and money on a day to day basis. Econ in itself is a very different way of looking at the world, and I would say it's helped me for the better.",
    "I learned about the fundamental concepts of microeconomics.",

    "I developed knowledge about very basic economics.",
    "I learned basic economic formulas and strategies, but most importantly how to think economically.",

    "I learned how to use costs, prices, and externalities to view things in terms of utility.",
    "I became better at analyzing graphs and thinking critically about problems. Professor Oster posed a lot theoretical questions that made me think on a deeper level.",
    "Learned about introductory microeconomics, theory of the firm was interesting",
    "Even though I took IB Higher Level Economics, I learned a lot about the role of utility and efficiency in the market. This class helped me take basic economic theorems and think of them in the real world. Usually, microeconomics had been taught to me without too many examples, and by seeing these theorems applied into the real world, I managed to understand\/visualise them better.",
    "Nothing",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics and how firms people and the government interact in an economic standpoint.",
    "How to self-study",
    "This course introduced fundamental principles of microeconomics and helped me develop skills for approaching real-world issues from an economic analytical approach. We expanded beyond topics such as competitive and non-competitive production, market failure and consumer theory and applied what we learned to issues such as carbon emissions and were exposed to relevant current research.",

    "This was my first college lecture, and coming from a school where no class was more than 30 people, I definitely, more than anything else, learned how to take notes, study, and prepare for exams in a class with sections and problem sets instead of assigned textbook readings and quizzes. In terms of the material itself, I learned a lot about the basics of microeconomics from a sort of strange, in limbo point of view. In high school, or econ class was almost all logical, whereas my friend in Intermediate Microeconomics seemed to be looking at the same material, but from a mathematical point of view. Or, half logic, half equations but we don't know where they come from or what they mean made the class something of a constant struggle to understand the true nature of these economics but only so much so we didn't confuse ourselves with the other material. Also, switching professors halfway through the curriculum was definitely something to get used to, as each taught with very different styles and very different emphases.",

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: not too difficult of a class or concepts. Weaknesses: More time could have been spent on some of the more complicated portions.",
    "TA's and professors are excellent",
    "The notes went way too fast and I struggled with the professor switch.",
    "There are lots of opportunities to get help; there are peer tutoring sessions for problem set help each week, and there are always multiple review sessions prior to midterms\/finals.",
    "Since the class is mainly first years, there is strong community within the class. But the weaknesses are the professor, the way the class was taught (barely touching on foundational material and giving us PSETs that were not related to material taught in class), and the structure of the test (not main ideas, vague questions).",
    "Strengths: I thought professor Goldberg was awesome, and I wish she could have taught the whole course. Professor Oster's style was very different and therefore wasn't fun to readjust to. Section helped a lot to understand how to sort through the information we're given in lecture, but my teaching fellow (daniella) tried way too much to relate to us and make us laugh, because it wasted sooooo much time. I'd literally open the solutions in the next window and correct my answers myself because she took so long to go over them. Improvements: Grading on the homework was a bit maddening. How can you only get 3, 4, or a 5 points out of 5? If you miss a single part of one small question you immediately get knocked down 20%, which is ridiculous. The homework was extremely short (less than two hours a week), but I would've appreciated it being a bit longer in order to give you more chances to practice the material. It also seems very subjective, because there are no intermediate grades between a 4 and a 5. It's mildly infuriating.",
    "The course introduced a wide variety of subtopics and definitely taught me the basics of microeconomics. The lectures presented useful content, although at times they were a bit too fast-paced during difficult topics. I sometimes found that I did not fully have time to read, absorb and take notes on all the content. The sections were useful in that we did additional practice problems, but I would have liked if some time had been dedicated to going over problem set questions from the students.",
    "The course would be more engaging if more applications of the material were discussed. I'd be particularly interested to learn about public policy applications.",
    "A strength of the course are the discussion sections, which is the only place I actually learned. A weakness would be the lectures, in that they are often vague, move too fast, and often have technical issues or bad slides. The course could be improved by spending more time on the important sections in lecture rather than moving very fast through a lot of material that never appeared on any of the tests.",
    "The lectures were sometimes not very engaging.",
    "The lectures can move so fast where you get totally swamped by the material covered and may get very confused.",
    "Strengths: both lecturers were great Weakness: tough grading on tests- losing points for unnecessary reasons",
    "Strengths - great textbook Weakness - transitioning between two professors in the middle of the course was difficult because they have different styles of teaching and writing psets and exams",
    "I felt that I did not learn very much at all from the lectures in this course, which is problematic because this class requires students to attend 2.5 hours of lecture per week. I would say that 80% of the learning that took place in this class was either through section, office hours, or my own personal study. I went to the vast majority of lectures, and I felt that the professors moved too quickly and did not spend adequate time explaining each concept. It was difficult to write down anything that made sense before the professor would go to the next slide. However, I will say that section was generally very helpful for learning material. My teaching fellow always went appropriately in-depth on every concept. There is definitely a support network in place for this class through the teaching fellows, a multitude of office hours, and peer tutoring resources. I think that the course would be greatly improved if lectures spent more time fully explaining each concept, instead of leaving that to the teaching fellows in section. It becomes increasingly frustrating to go to lecture week after week and feel like you're learning nothing.",
    "weakness: lectures were fairly disorganized, would help if they explained everything in a good order and had charts that detailed what formula\/equation goes to what to help the learning process for students who did not take ap micro.",
    "The curve in the class was quite strong, yet each lecture was dull and generally unexciting. Also, the course overall seemed unorganized, for example the location for many of the sections changed over the course of the semester, which was a slight inconvenience.",
    "Overall, I think the problem sets were excellent but sometimes the concepts themselves were not explained as clearly in class. For instance, the whole unit on average costs and marginal costs in the long and short run felt like a lot of jargon and graphs and acronyms. On the other hand, problems were very helpful and applicable, problem sets and sections especially, and some concepts were taught very well: externalities and expected utility come to mind.",
    "I really enjoyed when our coursework was grounded in real-world examples (more during Professor Oster's portion of the term). The course sometimes felt disorganized, or like I could only understand intro concepts after completing the rest of a \"unit\" -- it would be useful to know where we are going with things before we get there.",
    "The strengths of the course was that we went over a lot of topics related to microeconomics and had the opportunity to learn about how to think about the way the world works in an economic way. A weakness of the course was that the notes on the slides were often messy and difficult to follow. This made studying difficult as the material was jumbled around.",
    "I think that the strengths of this class is that the material is genuinely interesting, and the problems make you think about how the world works rather than just straight memorization and application. The weaknesses though often prevented me from enjoying the strengths. The change of professor was not conducive to learning whatsoever, because the two professors had different teaching styles and gave very different types of exams. Prof. Oster gave exams that were not at all similar to previous years, and all the TFs would warn us that it would not be useful to review them. But that left us very little to review- -- her psets were very short (3-4 questions typically), and the lecture slides were useless to review, because they were entirely illegible. The technology in the lecture hall often times did not work, and the professors' writing on the tablet appeared like scribbles. Some lectures were disorganized, unclear, and rushed, but since it is such a big class, students are just left confused. Furthermore, section was not very useful, because the section materials were from previous exams or psets (which apparently were useless for our exams).",
    "I liked the class a lot, and a lot of its strengths I mentioned above. I'm not sure how I'd improve it, since econ 101 (or 115 here) is just a standard college course.",
    "Strengths- there are plenty of resources for practice available to students Weaknesses- lectures were not well-organized",
    "Class is well-taught by expert professors. Lots of resources. Make live-stream lectures available online.",
    "In terms of strengths, I found the TFs and peer tutors extremely helpful in completing the weekly psets for this course. There are plenty of office hours available for students to attend each week. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes it is very difficult to stay engaged during the lecture because the material in class sometimes feels irrelevant when it comes to applying them to the real world -- in this way the material can seem a bit dry at times.",
    "The class was very dependent on both professors (Prof. Oster and Prof. Goldberg). However, one weakness was the use of the projector and notes written on an electronic screen which were at times illegible. One thing to consider is that at times I found that certain topics were not sufficiently explained and I relied on my prior microeconomics knowledge. However, Prof. Oster did well at keeping the hall interested and on their toes. Her sense of humor made going to lectures fun and overall I really enjoyed going to class because of her. Also, my section class was extremely helpful due to a great TF.",
    "The strengths are the problems sets because they force you to pay attention in class. The weakness of this class is the amount of students in the lecture.",
    "The strengths of this course are the fact that the slides are posted online and so can be reviewed later in depth, which is especially useful when studying. Some weaknesses include the inconsistencies with the professors in their teaching methods, struggle with technology in lectures, and type of questioning. Though I preferred Sharon's teaching style to Pinelope's, the abrupt switch after Midterm 1 was a little confusing.",
    "The strength is that this course was taught by two very accomplished professors in the field of economics, and it was interesting to learn about the material, which I find fascinating! However, the large lecture makes the class kind of dull at times, and I often found myself having to learn all of the material right before exams.",
    "I learned the course better by reading the textbook than attending lecture once Professor Oster took over. Problem sets were quantitative applications of ideas using graphs. This course would be more interesting if it were taught as a seminar. Using section to solve a few problems was helpful for problem sets, but not very interesting because students slowed the pace by complaining about solving P = a - bQ and dwelling on simple algebra.",
    "Very interesting material, but there are huge gaps between what is on the lecture, what is done in section, what is on the problems sets and what is on the midterms\/exam.",
    "I think the speed of the lectures were sometimes either too fast or too slow.",
    "strengths; the professors are very knowledgeable and have great experience from the real world Weaknesses; We switched professors mid year. By switching professsors, the exam styles also changed slightly.",
    "Even though the course material was interesting, the lectures were sometimes dry and boring. The professors were not engaging.",
    "It was interesting and the professor gave good examples. However, the lecture was often difficult to understand because of the way it was taught - the graphs drawn on the slides weren't clear at all and the lecture slides were all in very short bullet points that was difficult to understand later when studying for midterms\/final.",
    "It is clearly a well structured class. I think lectures could be a bit more thorough in terms of what students are expected to produce in assignments.",
    "Too large, not as focused, but perhaps the seminar is better for those qualities. In depth analysis was displayed well.",
    "I felt like the lecture notes were hard to follow along with and made studying harder. I enjoyed the amount of resources we had for the class including the peer tutors and wide array of office hours",
    "For weaknesses, the lecture hall could be changed (the slides never seemed to work). Furthermore, they could offer longer section sessions. For strengths, the peer tutoring sessions really helped.",
    "After taking this course I am not a big fan of lectures, it's a lot harder to learn and it goes really fast.",
    "I liked how there were two different teachers. Great TAs.",
    "The lectures covered the material briefly but were very difficult to understand if just posted online. The sections were just reiterations of the lecture and weren't necessarily useful",
    "Strengths: The lectures were amazing! Weaknesses: sometimes diagrams were difficult to read",
    "Strengths were the abundance of resources (tutoring and otherwise) to help you with psets and exams. Weaknesses were that our tests this year after Penny left didn't match past exams well, so it was hard to have material to study with, but that will likely change since Sharon isn't teaching next semester.",
    "Too many students, not enough time to understand the material",
    "Pretty dry material, big class (kinda a strength and weakness) Good introduction, good peer tutors, lots of people willing to help you",
    "I think my strength was taking the ideas we learned and applying them on given on tests or problem sets etc to different situations than we discussed in class. As far as weakness, I think I did not learn all the terms I could have. This just requires more memorization.",
    "The strengths were that the lectures were very easy to understand but a weakness was that not all of the writing on the slides were legible.",
    "The strengths of this course include the organization of lectures, the professor's enthusiasm for teaching and the section discussions at the end of the week to more intimately cover class content. The weaknesses of this course include the fast pace and the small quantity of homework\/ lack of quizzes.",
    "Well taught but the problem sets have extremely unnecessary applications",
    "Strengths: psets, TF network, resource availability Weaknesses: lectures are too speedy, midterms dont cover psets, sections",
    "Both professors were amazing at presenting the material in interesting ways.",
    "Second half moved too quickly. Not enough precious material that matched assessment format.",
    "The lecture could be more engaging, the powerpoint slides could have been better (they end up just looking like a blob of colors with little information). I only really learned by going to section and reading the textbook.",
    "weakness is the size. teachers assumptions that students know some concepts from before. exam questions are hard",
    "One strength of this course with Professor Oster was her ability to connect what we were learning about to the real world. She gave a lot of great examples and explanations of concepts. One weakness is that the course moves kind of quickly, since it is a big lecture.",
    "The strength was easily the professors: Dr. Morar and Professor Oster. The weakness was that it could be dry but that is to be expected with an introductory lecture class.",
    "Strengths: the professors are really good and the optional sections allow those who need it to learn even more. weaknesses: the class switched professors halfway through the year. it was confusing.",
    "It was explained well through her examples, but the graphs drawn were hard to interpret. I think it can be improved if maybe there were more calculation examples rather than just the derivative of the formulas.",
    "Material went really fast in lecture AND in section. Hard to follow for someone not accustomed to thinking this way. Most interesting parts were the extensions of the concepts to the real world through examples and anecdotes.",
    "This course would be miles better if the teaching and explanations were better. The actual material isnt hard, but it is explained in a way that makes everything way more confusing than it is. Also the TFs generally were not very good. I think this course needs a lot of work.",
    "The use of technology in the lecture (hard to view slides, quiet microphone, etc) sometimes made it difficult to learn. However, the content of the course was very interesting and both Prof. Goldberg and Prof. Oster were great lecturers!",
    "The teachers didnt explain things and rarely were engaging.",
    "I thought the lecture was often very boring and not engaging. I also thought sections were not very engaging and could often be a drag. More hands on problems would be better.",
    "The strengths are the professors; weaknesses include the size of the lecture and the section leader's lack of teaching ability.",
    "Sections arent very helpful and I think it would be better to have a textbook. Great lecturers.",
    "The sections were not very helpful and the class notes were hard to decipher once they were posted.",
    "The lectures could be recorded, as the professors handwriting isnt the best.",
    "I had three different TAs which was challenging but believe a strength of this course is the office hours they offer",
    "The best part of the course is that it's very straightforward and you are held individually responsible (although there are sections). That being said, it's also the primary weakness of the course for many students, especially as they transition from small high schools where they received more encouragement\/support.",
    "The lectures were not that engaging and sections were not very helpful as it was mainly just showing the students how to solve a problem without actually trying it on our own.",
    "Good examples in class, section was good, teaching overall could have been a little more engaging. More real life anecdotes would have made it more fun. Sometimes the lectures got a little too abstract to care about.",
    "Enjoyed the information regarding the concepts of microeconomics. Offer extra help for students struggling with the calculation and problem solving.",
    "Strength would be that there are plenty of resources available that help bolster your understanding. Weakness is definitely the difficulty in learning in either lecture or section, nothing was very clearly explained or taught well.",
    "The lectures were more concept related rather than applying the concepts. I wish the lectures included more practice problems.",
    "Weakness- should have been more mandatory Ta times. Not very engaging lecture",
    "The strength is that studying for exams and doing psets really makes you learn the material. The weakness is that everything is slightly disorganized.",
    "Its a large lecture course, so its a bit disengaging but there are lots of chances outside of lecture with TFs to ask questions and become engaged",
    "The switch from lecturers was manageable but we had to get used to both the different teaching and testing styles. However, both lecturers were strong and entertaining.",
    "I struggled to get a lot out of the lecture because it was so large making it hard to pay attention and retain the information well. For me, the problem sets were where most of my learning took place by taking concepts discussed in class and having to apply them.",
    "The PowerPoint slides are confusing to understand after the lecture since the lecturer hand-drew complicated graphs. A strength is that the lecturer used relevant real-life examples.",
    "The course teaches a fair bit of material which can be daunting for students during lectures (as material is covered very quickly, with little time for students to reflect and ensure that they understand before moving on to the next topic). However, this weakness I believe is largely made up for by the availability of sections in which students are able to ask questions and clarify the parts of lectures they did not quite understand. I think the non-compulsory sections were a strength as they allowed students who required additional support to attend, and those who felt confident with the material in a given week to use the time otherwise. However, I felt the sections relied too heavily on simply solving problems for the sake of getting them correct - I would probably have attended sections more often if we had been able to use them as a forum to discuss theories deeper, including their limitations, empirical evidence to support or refute them, and the links between economic theory in both the academic and real worlds. The most significant weakness I felt this course suffered from was the manner of assessment. I often felt that the questions in both problem sets and exams were vague at best and outright ambiguous at worst, such that students were unclear what exactly was expected from them in their response. This was reflected in the reports of several students I have spoken to who often told me that they either felt that they knew the vast majority, if not all, of the material, but felt that their ability was misrepresented by the exams because they hadn't understood the specific demands of the questions; and other students who did well on the exams but seemed surprised that they had achieved that outcome because during the exam they had felt very unsure about their answers. I think that greater clarity on how questions are created and graded would have helped students to more successfully apply the knowledge they had gained to the questions on the exams.",
    "The lecture could definitely be a lot more engaging. I found it quite lackluster, especially during the first half. I wish the lectures could be more focused on real-life problems and issues, such as poverty.",
    "The class covers a lot of material in a lecture but the lectures can become somewhat boring.",
    "Its very easy to get lost in the big number of people that are in this class. It's easy to go by and not do a lot of work for the class and still do well on problem sets, but then the midterm or final comes around and you aren't that prepared. Even with section, it's sometimes tough to really get your question through if you do not understand something because the TA is just trying to get through all the material.",
    "This course could be taught in a room with better access to technology. Also it was a bit of an inconvenience to switch instructors mid semester.",
    "If it were the same teacher from the beginning it would be better I liked both professotrs but the change of professors was confusing",
    "Sometimes the lectures would move too quickly, and if you missed something (or didn't understand something) you would be lost for the majority of the lecture. I think that the slideshows were very helpful, specially as study material, but we would go through them too quickly sometimes. I really enjoyed the use of examples to visualise the theorems.",
    "Everything was awful. Lectures were terrible",
    "Many of the exam questions were poorly worded. I often felt that I was not being tested on the content itself but in whether I could understand what the question was saying\/what it was asking for.",
    "This course was very interesting but the sections were sometimes confusing",
    "Could have a more interactive lecture by using clickers or something in class. Keep the students involved",
    "The structure of the lecture isn't the most conducive to the students' learning experience due to the fact that there is such a large enrollment and there is no opportunity to ask questions. However, the professor's lectures were mostly all well-explained and engaging. Sometimes the material learned in lecture didn't line up exactly with the practice we did in section.",
    "Strengths: Material was always kept interesting and relevant, the course was suitable for both those very interested in economics and those simply trying it out Weaknesses: The changing of the professors mid semester was a little difficult because it meant that we had to adjust to a new professors teaching style and exam format mid year",
    "I really liked the breadth of what was covered, but I found the lecture confusing at times, especially with the handwriting during the lectures.",
    "I feel as though there wasn't a very direct correlation between what was taught in lecture and what appeared on Problem Sets and Exams. I also think having an entirely new professor with no past exams to look at was difficult, as past exams for practice weren't as helpful as they were in past years.",
    "Strengths: the expectation for the class were very straightforward, had many TF and peer tutor hours, a lot of past material was provided for review and study Weakness: the layout of the powerpoints were confusing and illegible, concepts would be under-discussed before moving on, many many technical difficulties",
    "Lectures could be clearer, but help from the TFs and peer tutors was always available!",
    "The huge lectures with the teacher writing on slides was not helpful. The writing was often illegible and not a lot of material was covered. Tutor taught me a lot of the important things. Didnt learn a lot in lectures at all. Way too fast paced.",
    "Strengths: Strong theoretical application, good practical application Weaknesses: High demand of intuition, which sometimes limited students interest in the actual learning and made them more worried about the exam.",
    "A strength was the fact that the order in which we went over topics made sense given the material. At times, though, the course relied too heavily on section to teach methods and problems not mentioned in lecture.",
    "I personally felt that Professor Osters lectures were not helpful at all, and found my self basically teaching myself most of the lessons. The TF sessions can be helpful, but there were usually a lot of students there, so it was tough to get one on one help. The sections were more helpful than the lectures if you had a good TF (which I did).",
    "The problem sets were so useless for the tests.",
    "lectures were not engaging enough",
    "The biggest weakness to this course is that lecture slides are not released until after each lecture. I found myself scrambling to write down notes and by the time I finished it was on to the next slide, leaving me no time to process anything that Sharon Oster was saying. This left me with crappy notes that I never even went back to review and little to no knowledge from the lectures. If note taking is improved, this course will overall be improved. Students must be provided with the lecture slides ahead of time if anything is to come out of lecture. A strength to this course would be the sections and peer tutoring; I found both to be extremely helpful in furthering my u derstanding",
    "I found that the large lecture made it very difficult to understand and retain information. Near the end of the semester, I felt that I was teaching myself through the textbook. This became an issue when some content from the textbook contradicted the information given in lecture slides. I also found the lecture slides incoherent and difficult to follow on my own when I attempted to use them for reviews for exams. I do not think large lectures like this are conducive to in-depth learning whatsoever.",
    "Strengths: Good lectures Weaknesses: Bad lecturers",
    "The lectures often seem inefficient and longer than they need to be.",
    "More personal instruction",
    "Strength- the TF and section system Weakness- the broadness of the topics",
    "Honestly, the lectures are so incredibly dry, and you could tell over time by the number of students who stopped showing up. I would say Professor Oster's lectures were too quick, and I wish we were given the lecture slides in advance to have a chance to properly preview the content. It would make showing up to lecture much more appealing, as we would better absorb the content instead of letting us be hit with it and barely be able to recover anything from it. As someone without any economics experience taking this course, this is my biggest complaint.",
    "I really enjoyed Professor Oster's teaching style, especially her incorporation of real world examples. I think there was at times a disparity in the information\/resources one could access depending on which TA you were interacting with. There were problem sets where the solution keys were incorrect, as well, which led to some confusion. Overall I think most of the weaknesses came from it being such a large lecture course, and were mostly logistical.",
    "Sharon Oster was a phenomenal lecturer. I thought her teaching method was compelling and clear. The only things that would've improved lecture are if they had posted the slides before hand so that we could follow along as the professor was lecturing, and if they had found a way to write reliably and a little more legibly on the board. Section was actually good for the most part as well. I think the section needed to be an hour long though, as we always ran over time. It was really helpful to see problems worked out though.",
    "It's easy to tune out in lecture because it's such a big class, and the material can be a bit dry sometimes",
    "It is very difficult to learn much in lecture but section is very helpful.",
    "I slept in this class way too much, it was kind of embarrassing. The lecture style just wasn't very engaging and the lack of problem solving throughout the class made it quite difficult to grasp concepts being taught.",
    "Oh where do I begin. First of all, the lectures are very insufficient in providing students with a deep enough understanding to find success on psets and examinations. Slides are flipped through unbelievably fast and with little explanation. Additionally, the TFs are genuinely aweful. I don't know what this department is doing staffing the most popular course in Yale with some of the worst supporting faculty I have ever seen. Most are far from articulate in section while the others are far from able to provide ample explanation of the course material being presented. The grading system is completely nonsense; one of the TFs graded unreasonably harsh throughout the year, particularly on the first exam where tons of students lost points on definitions of all things - so particular. The material was great but I learned all on own. It's frankly disappointing how poor a class like intro micro is taught at a school like Yale.",
    "The organization of information presented to the students could be better",
    "Sharon was not a great teacher. pinelopi was great and taught to the exams. Sharon would go on tangents related to business school investing and her abilities and qualifications. It would have been helpful but not in a microecon class. she taught as if we were in b school.",
    "I think the strength of the course is the organization and coverage of the material. I think the weakness of the course is the lecture style and pset style. I wish more info was covered in the psets in the 2nd half, and more engaging lectures would be helpful.",
    "The lectures were fairly boring and the discussion section material helped for the problem sets but not so much for the exams.",
    "More clear office hour scheduling with less re-scheduling and better feedback system.",
    "Strengths - the PSETS help with learning the material and techniques, and the research papers that are discussed during lectures offer interesting real-life insights on economic principles. Also, extra help was always available and accessible if needed. Weaknesses - use of technology (lectures and notes are unclear), test designs (questions were poorly worded and generally enigmatic, often with little relevance to topics and techniques discussed in class), curriculum (incredibly convoluted and not logically ordered), etc...",
    "Strengths are definitely the TAs and the peer tutoring review sessions.",
    "Lecture slides could be better and lectures could use more real world examples.",
    "It could be a little bit more tethered to the textbook or some kind of syllabus to which we can refer, but the lecture slides were comprehensive enough to compensate",
    "I had so much trouble following the lecture.. most lectures I left without fully or even half understanding what was going on, because once you get confused about one thing, you don't know what's going on the whole rest of the way. Also there were so many technical difficulties in this class, or just i couldn't understand the prof's handwriting when she used the electronic pen.",
    "Although the content can be very interesting at times, it was often very hard to keep up with every aspect of lecture. If you spaced out for 1 min, you were out. Very often were we all lost and the professor didn't realize.",
    "I thought all of the extra-help resources were phenomenal. I didnt like how the professor switched half way through the semester, though. I also thought the PowerPoint slides uploaded to canvas could be improved, as the ones uploaded were illegible.",
    "Strengths: Peer Tutors were awesome, shoutout to Joe Ribaudo for being the GOAT. Weaknesses: technical difficulties every other class, the professor's handwriting was unacceptably illegible (seriously, it was just embarrassing an completely useless in terms of note-taking). I appreciated Professor Oster's bringing in numerous real-life examples of the concepts we were discussing, although sometimes they were kind of irrelevant or beyond the scope of the class.",
    "The lecture was a bit dry sometimes, so I did find it somewhat hard to follow, but I really enjoyed how real world examples were constantly being used to contextualize the material.",
    "It was difficult to study for exams because of the switch in professor and teaching style. The second half of the course was definitely more engaging because it included a more conceptual understanding of the course material by using policy oriented topics.",
    "I believe that the lecture would be better if taught by one professor and if the style of teaching and examination was similar from year to year.",
    "The lecture is too large and oftentimes concepts are not explained super clearly, but perhaps for a lecture that large there's nothing really to be done. I do wish there were less words on the slides as they were very distracting.",
    "Its a lecture, so all negatives really come from the nature of the class. Besides that though, the resources were bountiful so it made up for the lectures shortcomings.",
    "Smaller classes would be ideal. There was a good amount of review material, which was greatly appreciated.",
    "Better pacing of the lectures. Some days moved very quickly and some very slowly. The content of the course is good. The TAs are good and I would have liked more review sessions run by then in addition to peer tutoring.",
    "Practice tests for the second midterm",
    "The Power point slides could be made more concise.",
    "I thought that there weren't many strengths. Weaknesses included how boring and aggravating the class was to take. There was never a time in the class where i thought to myself that is really cool, and I'm most likely going to be an econ major. Just definitely not the best class in my opinion.",
    "There definetely can be better slides for review or cleaner notes taken in presentation. I couldnt read the graphs or handwriting in most cases.",
    "Content was substantial yet remained varied, I felt that it was a very nice to be exposed to so many aspects of economics within the introductory course.",
    "Sometimes the examples get very convoluted",
    "The class was structured in a way that created a gap in instruction between the lectures and the sections. I often didn't see how what we were taught in lecture applied to section.",
    "Considering that it is a lecture catering toward 300 students, this class is well-organized for student learning. Ultimately, its really up to the students to actively rehearse the material and do practice problems on their own. You get out of the class what you put into it. Lectures werent very exciting, but I did appreciate that Professor Oster brought in real-world economic concepts during the second part of the semester.",
    "The lectures covered a lot at a fast pace and were hard to keep up with if you have little prior knowledge in Microeconomics. Most of the learning you have to do on your own. Thankfully, Daniela went over some practice problems and concepts slowly during sections, which was very helpful.",
    "Strengths - wasn't too reliant on textbook Weaknesses - overly populated class with not enough resources, lectures could be clearer and recorded so that students can go back to it, often the technological difficulties made some of the slides almost illegible, the peer tutoring office hours got extremely packed",
    "This course offers a foundational understanding of economics which is crucial to continuing in the field.",
    "I thought the lectures had room for improvement, especially in terms of the technology used to present the slides. The microphones would be great if they had amplified the sound to fill more of the entirety of the auditorium. Also, the tablet used to present the notes may have made it difficult for the two professors to draw the graphs neatly and more accurately. The strengths of this course would have to be the office hours offered by the teaching assistants!",
    "This is a classic Yale large lecture. While the lecture is large and at times not very engaging, the many office hours that are held for students are incredibly helpful and allowed me to understand the materials presented in lecture. The exams a slightly unpredictable, but the overall workload is very manageable. P-Sets are challenging but not time consuming, especially with help from TAs in office hours.",
    "I think generally it's pretty good right now.",
    "I think some of the lecture presentations could be a little bit more digestible.",
    "I thought the course was pretty well run, my only issue with it was that at times the technology available in the law school meant the graphs were rather hard to read. Maybe moving the class or improving the technology would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: helpful office hours, materials (slides before + after class, old exams for review, ANSWER KEYS etc) available online, committed and interesting teachers Weaknesses: expensive textbook. Although the textbook was not necessarily, it was very useful, and it is a shame that it is so expensive. Frequent technology issues.",
    "A strength is the expertise of professors. A weakness could be the usefulness of section.",
    "The course was not structured well at all. Lectures went by super quickly at a very fast pace. Material which was taught in lecture should be reinforced in section, but section failed to do this. As a result, when Psets were due, students would flood peer tutors office hours. It could be improved if the class structure were more organized.",
    "One major strength is that it teaches the fundamentals over and over again in class and in section to build strong skills. A weakness of this course was that sometimes the course took so long.",
    "I think the course could do at a slower pace, so people with limited knowledge in the subject could catch up. Given the different levels of experience individuals have coming into the course.",
    "The problem sets and the discussion sections have been extremely helpful for my academic development in the course. The lectures, on the other hand, could definitely be improved by making them more engaging and interesting for the students.",
    "It is a very large lecture so sometimes that makes it difficult to get individual help but I think the sections were very well done and there was lots of peer tutoring and other resources available for help.",
    "The course material does not go very indepth into the mathematics of concepts. But, most of the midterms and exams were mathematic based. This gave a false sense of understanding to students when really they were unprepared. Also, the writing of notes by the instructor was horrible and most slides were not even legible. This made it impossible to review notes from the lecture and made studying very difficult.",
    "The office hours with Professor Oster and the TA's was very helpful. Lecture could be slightly dull and the lecturer often went too fast for me to fully grasp concepts, this would be understandable if we had been pressed for time but the lecture often finished 15 minutes before it was meant to. It was sometimes hard to link what was being taught in class to homework questions and exam questions.",
    "Strengths: Breadth of material covered. Definitely a solid foundation moving forward. Weaknesses: Large lecture format",
    "Strengths: overview of material with many options to get help Weaknesses: handwriting by teacher not good, and she skipped over some basic concepts\/didn't explain properly so it was difficult to understand",
    "The weekly problem sets and TF sections are helpful for students to comprehend the materials taught in the lectures. One major weakness of the course is that during the lecture, it sometimes is very hard for students to keep up since the professor goes very fast, and it's hard to read the words on the lecture slides and to pay attention to what the professor is saying at the same time.",
    "The strengths of this class were definitely the excess upon excess of practice material from the previous years of exams that helped immensely in prepping for tests. That, as well as all the study sessions provided by the TF's definitely ensured success if success was desired. The weaknesses came much more from the top. The slides with Goldberg were constantly shutting down and causing distractions, and the slides with Oster were genuinely illegible.",
    "A strength is that the professors were engaging lecturers and I think that the problem sets a review materials that are available on canvas were very conducive to learning the material and being prepared for the exams. However, I thought that the sections were not super helpful and I wished that we used more calculus because I think that it would have made it easier to conceptualize the material.",
    "Strengths- The course had some great TF's\/ peer tutors\/ other resources to take advantage of outside of class and Professor Oster was very engaging. Weaknesses- I think that any lecture course of such great size is inherently harder to engage in."

    "Yes, some of this material is just good to know for the rest of your life.",
    "Yes, because you should take a microeconomics course to see if you like it. Yale has a great Economics department.",
    "I would recommend this to other students, but I would emphasize that in my experience, you need to put in work on your own if you want to have a chance of doing well in this class. This class is not for anyone looking for a gut QR. If you are not motivated to go to section, go to office hours, or work with others to get homework done, this is not the class for you.",
    "pretty dull class, dull lecture, dull sections, dull material.",
    "If you want to take higher level econ in the future this class or 110 is required, so yes. If the class is not a requirement for a class you want to take now or in the future, then no.",
    "Absolutely. Wish I had taken it sooner. Economics is important for any field you go into.",
    "Yes. It's a good foundation course for a general understanding of how markets work.",
    "Yes -- I think these are important concepts to learn, but it ends up being a lot of self-teaching without much feedback.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I believe it is important to understand how our society functions and how basic principles of economics play into everyday life. Incentives, motivations, opportunity cost are some basic tenets that we can use to explain how buyers and sellers -- or consumers and producers -- make decisions. The interactions of individual decision making is microeconomics.",
    "This class is a prerequisite for so many other classes, and a natural starting point to econ, so my recommendation will likely not have much weight in your decision to take it. But be warned that if the professor stays the same, the class is not a gut. The exams are conceptual and often designed to trick you, so if you do not really understand the information, you will not do well. The huge lecture is not conducive to learning, so you will have to put in time on your own to understand the material. So I suppose you have to take the class, but be ready to put in the work to really do well.",
    "Absolutely. For all the reasons I mentioned at the very beginning. It was a very informative & interesting course.",
    "I think that economics is a good subject to have a basic understanding of regardless of a student's field of interest, and for that, this course gives a good overview, so I would recommend it. However, the lecture format is not the most conducive to student learning\/ engagement, so the seminar may be a better option.",
    "Yes, it taught many topics not covered in high school\/AP economics. Taught by reputable professors. Perfect mix of lecture and discussion.",
    "Many of the higher level economics courses or economics-related courses have ECON 115 as a pre-requisite, so I recommend taking it during your first year to get it out of the way in order to open the doors for classes in the future. However, the lecture can be very boring at times and I found myself having to struggle staying awake during class -- if this seems like it would be the case for you, then ECON 110 might be a better option for you because you can be more engaged with your instructor. Also be warned: I chose the lecture over the seminar because I heard about how great the curve was (in the end, 40% of students get As\/A-s, 50% get Bs, and 10% getCs), but it didn't seem to be as great as people made it out to be. The workload was extremely manageable (one problem set per week), and the TF and peer tutor office hours were extremely helpful when I didn't know how to do some of the problems on the problem set.",
    "Yes, if you want a comprehensive introduction to microeconomics this is a good class to take that isn't too much work.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who have no problem learning in a less individualized atmosphere. If a student didn't thrive in those environments, I'd recommend trying to get into an economics seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course if they were interested in majoring in economics.",
    "Yes, everyone should know the basics of the workings of the economy.",
    "Even though my experience with this class was mediocre, I would say if you have any interest in economics I would recommend talking an intro micro course! I wish I took the seminar, as it seems like that course is much more engaging, but the lecture is great if you only have time for minimal involvement (3-4 hours a week outside lecture).",
    "The models at this level of economics are simple to the point of boredom and irrelevance. I would recommend reading a textbook for basic ideas and skipping to the next level if you believe that economics generally can provide a good model of consumers and sellers (leaving the course, I didn't believe in the assumptions that underlie economic thinking, ie: rational behavior, ranked preferences, preferences => actions).",
    "I would recommend this class to pretty much any student who is vaguely interested in economics. If you just show up and do all the work, it's hard to go lower than a B.",
    "Yes. I like the way of thinking that this class taught me.",
    "If the student is willing to put in the work, then yes.",
    "Yes. This course is a pre-rec for other Econ courses.",
    "Yes, it's a good way to know if you are interested in economics. It also starts at the beginning and is definitely a good introductory course.",
    "It's a good course to take to get to know a bit about economics and you'll definitely think more about your day-to-day choices (is your marginal cost equal to your marginal benefit?).",
    "I would if they are willing to put in the work and willing to learn extra.",
    "I would recommend the lecture if the student is very self motivated and wanted a lot of resources to help them, but if they dont really engage well with long lectures that could sometimes be hard to follow along with Id go with the seminar",
    "It's certainly not the most interesting course, but you'll get a basic understanding of microeconomics. Prof. Oster is fairly engaging, but the material isn't fascinating. Take it if you're interested in economics or are considering econ as a major.",
    "Yes, it was interesting",
    "Yes, although it is a difficult course, you learn a lot of material. I feel as though this course pushed me as a student in positive ways.",
    "Yes since it is a prerequisite to many majors",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a straightforward QR credit and don't mind it being somewhat dry, it's a good course to take.",
    "No unless they are majoring in econ.",
    "Yes if you are vaguely interested in how the world works.",
    "I would if you are planning on majoring in Econ, but I would not otherwise.",
    "I think this is a course every student at Yale should take at one point. Again, the kind of thinking taught by this course is something that can really change how you do things in different aspects of your life.",
    "Yes. Although some of the concepts are a little basic and dry, some are also very engaging and applicable to the real world.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in economics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, as Economics 115 is essential for anyone considering a career in business, finance or economics.",
    "Purely because its a prerequisite to everything else, yes",
    "It is a prerequisite. So yes.",
    "Yes, just so that you can build an economic base in order to eventually take higher level economic courses.",
    "If you are interested in majoring in any of the economic fields, I would recommend this course. It will give you a good understanding of basic microeconomics skills and challenge you in a way that will help train you for Yale as a whole.",
    "no",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone slightly interested in economics. Although it is not the most fun and engaging class, it gives a really good and necessary basis of information regarding microeconomics.",
    "if you want to take intro econ, its a good course.",
    "Yes, if they want to see if economics is right for them.",
    "Yes, it provided me with good general knowledge of economics and yes if you want to satisfy a QR distributional requirement and are not a strong math student.",
    "Taking an intro Econ class is helpful for anyone, regardless of major, but dont expect an easy A. The psets are easy, due once a week, but you will have to study your ass off for the midterms and pay attention to the boring lectures. Worth taking, but needs to be taken seriously.",
    "I would recommend taking introductory economics classes at Yale, but if you are looking for a high level of engagement and interaction with professors and TAs, I would recommend taking the seminar instead. While the lecture was still interesting and I found that I did learn a lot, it often felt like there was little engagement and feedback.",
    "Yes but only because you have to take it to major in economics.",
    "If they are interested in econ I probably would recommend the seminar so they would learn the material better.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, this is a fantastic course that was well-taught and very enjoyable. Most lectures were made applicable to real economic policy decisions, and the professors were very good at explaining things.",
    "Its a good foundation for many majors but not that exciting. Wont be your favourite class or your hardest.",
    "Yes, I would. Having a good understanding of economics can apply to all aspects of your daily life. Understanding micro will make you understand politics and decision making even better.",
    "Yes. good intro course for econ.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students who are interested in economics as it provides a great basis of information",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I think all people, especially those in the humanities, should take economics.",
    "I would only if they're actually interested in econ or really need a QR, I wouldn't tell them to take it just to learn something new.",
    "It's an interesting course with a lot of applications. If you are thinking of majoring you have to take it. I think most people should take it just for the base level of understanding and to decide whether they are interested in econ.",
    "Yes as it is a good starting point for understanding the world as an economist-citizen.",
    "I don't think I would unless you're interested in pursuing economics. I don't feel like I learned anything that changed the way I think or see the world. I don't see this course as noteworthy for anything aside from preparing for other economics courses.",
    "I would recommend it to someone interested in economics. It is very challenging but I feel it is an important class people should take.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this course unless the student needs it for a prerequisite",
    "If you have to take this course as a prerequisite, then take it. The material is understandable. Requires some learning before the exams, but overall not bad.",
    "I would, if you are looking for a large lecture course with involvement as much as you involve yourself. Theres pretty much help available 24\/7 if you look for it but if you feel good about the course it could be minimal involvement (section and lectures).",
    "Only if this student is thinking of being an econ major, otherwise these skills will either be forget or can be gleaned from online. The course is meant as an introduction and it does that well. However, for the purposes of the class, it understandably does not go beyond that.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a very common class for first years to take which allows for study groups to easily be formed. This further enhances the social aspect of Yale. It really makes you think about how to allocate your resources efficiently and just look at situations under a new lens. It's definitely a tough course in terms exams and problem sets but fairly easy in terms of intuition. It raises awareness to a lot of things we typically ignore in our everyday lives.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as an introductory course to economics.",
    "This course is fairly challenging conceptually to those who have not encountered economics before, and can seem very abstract. As such, I would not recommend it to another student unless they had professed an interest in the field of economics - in which case this is obviously a good course to start with.",
    "I would, if they wanted to become economics majors. However, if not, I'd say maybe they could take the seminar instead.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in taking any sort of economic major.",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in economics. If you arent, I would choose another QR to get your credit.",
    "I would recommend this to other people if they are any interested in economics. Even if you are not sure you want to major in Economics, I still think its a good class to take for people to try something new because I think it would be helpful for the rest of college and for life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in economics.",
    "yes, great intro course",
    "Yes, it's a great introduction to microeconomics, and a great introduction to the general economic way of thinking. It's a good way to find out if you're interested in economics.",
    "No. It was the worst class.",
    "Yes micro is very interesting and applicable",
    "No, it was a lot of stress for very little gain",
    "I would recommend this course if the student already has a limited background in economics, but I think it would probably be a more beneficial experience for a student with no prior knowledge of microeconomics to take the seminar given the fact that they have more opportunity to engage with the professor and ask questions to clarify material. Overall, I think the course was fairly good but suffered from problems related to the number of students enrolled.",
    "Yes. I was not sure what major I wanted to pursue as an incoming freshman but I am now leaning towards economics after taking this course.",
    "Yes, as I feel like economics is integral to a good education.",
    "If the student was interested in Economics, I would recommend this course. I think it depends on what kind of learner you are and what you are interested in. This course is interesting, but takes lots of effort because learning information in lecture is very different than learning it in a small group.",
    "Take this class but take it with friends. Its structure is too unorganized to work through alone.",
    "Yes, if interested in econ or anything business related",
    "I recommend this course to students who need to take it for their major, or for those who want an economics background. I learned a lot in the course!",
    "If you are passionate about Econ take it. Otherwise no, you wont get anything out of it .",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, as I believe it has an interesting approach for students who have no prior experience with economics.",
    "if you want to be an econ major then you must take it, but I wouldn't recommend it due to the poor teaching style of it.",
    "Yeah, the workload isnt bad and its great to see if you like Economics.",
    "It is pretty much what you would expect out of an introductory level economics class. If you are thinking of taking economics, it is a decent into to see if you would even like the subject.",
    "Yeah, it's intro.",
    "yes, the knowledge gained is essential to every student",
    "No. I do not think the large lecture is a good way to facilitate student learning. I would recommend other students to take the seminar instead of the lecture.",
    "Yes, because it is a massive first-year course that is good for meeting people and all that.",
    "Yes. I think its an important course for every student to at least be exposed to.",
    "Yes, it is a good course to develop basic understanding of economics. However I would recommend other students do the smaller seminar versions of the course.",
    "Only if they have to take it or if they want to explore econ more. It's not one of those courses you take just for the fun of it.",
    "I think basic economic knowledge is useful for anyone to have, so for that reason I would recommend this course. I didn't take the seminar, however, so I can't comment on how it would compare. I would say that ECON 115 requires a LOT of self-drive and self-directed push to go to office hours, peer tutors, etc. when you don't understand, which can be tiring\/difficult in its own way.",
    "I would recommend this course because it gives you a good understanding of economics at the level you interact with it, but also opens your mind to the many other ways to interact with the material.",
    "Yeah, it is an adequate course I'd say. Does what it says it does.",
    "Only if they are interested in economics.",
    "No, I'd suggest taking the 110 seminar instead. The engagement issue is too much to really be successful. You can definitely learn a lot, but that will be through maximizing your use of the resources available.",
    "Listen here and listen carefully - this class is NO JOKE. If you're one of those kids that's just chilling thinking this course would be a nice opportunity to try out economics at Yale, be careful. I came in thinking this course would be a breeze but ended up investing most my time in doing well. The class is full of students with insane econ backgrounds, some who placed in Micro theory but chose to take intro micro instead. The teaching is not where it needs to be: you will genuinely not learn unless you read the textbooks. The TFs are far from helpful, so you're really on your own. The material is great, don't get me wrong. This semester's professor, Ms. Oster, was well-intentioned, but it was just not easy. Building economic intuition in this class is like being a fish out of water - you're scrambling the entire semester. Be sure this is what you want to do before you do it.",
    "Yes I would. Because it is mandatory for the economics major.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I think microeconomics is important as a field and the workload for this class isn't prohibitively heavy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you want to gain foundational knowledge on economics.",
    "Mainly. Most people survived it, but based on what I've heard, I would rather take the seminar.",
    "Yes, I think it served as a good introduction to the ideas behind economics and can be an interesting class even if you are not planning on going into the major.",
    "Probably, I think the principles are important and the teaching was generally good.",
    "Yes - itll either encourage you to pursue Econ further or at the very least be a useful set of insights",
    "You may be better off learning microeconomics on your own over summer break.",
    "Yes. It is a class one must take before graduating, whether you like it or not.",
    "Yes I would, because it serves as a foundation for many more economics classes.",
    "I would recommend if you're looking for a decent QR without too much complex math. Also a great class to take as an upperclassmen, because the freshmen are in a constant state of panic and you're just cruising.",
    "Yes, because getting a foundation in microeconomics I think is key in understanding a lot of the events that occur everyday that impact many lives.",
    "If they want\/have to take an economics class, yes. It is a good introduction to more difficult Econ courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is unsure of their interest level in economics and would like an overview of microeconomics.",
    "Yeah; I took it for a QR credit and it's not too bad, not too mathy and does make me learn a lot.",
    "Its a building block course, so yes.",
    "No; it is a large lecture, and the material is not engaging enough for that format to be conducive to learning.",
    "I think econ isn't for me, so my perception is probably skewed. I found that in general, there was a lot to learn by oneself, so if you're the type of student who has trouble figuring out exactly what you're confused by, take the seminar instead. The teachers have time to answer your questions but not to help you figure out what they are.",
    "Yes, but if you havent taken economics previously (like in high school), be ready for quite a bit of work to understand the material.!",
    "Yes I would because it is an interesting way of thinking.",
    "I wouldn't, unless you are going to be an econ major. Other than that I think it would be a waste of a credit and a lot of your time. It just isn't very interesting in my opinion.",
    "Yes because it will give you a good intro to economics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. Econ has a bad rap, but a lot of concepts from the class are relevant to subjects other than finance, like climate protection, social policy, and nonprofit strategy. I think that students can benefit from having a basic understanding of things like taxes, cost-benefit analysis, etc., since it offers us a different perspective on how society works. The quality of the lectures really depended on the professor. My suggestion to anyone taking this class is to really try to do as much independent practice as you can. While going to office hours and review sessions will serve you well in getting the right answers, you should try problems on your own first. Most questions on the P-sets and exams are fair. Some pose more of an intellectual challenge\/conceptual application of the material, and these questions are mainly for the curve (which is pretty competitive, since everyone is actually trying to do well). Absolutely no need to spend money on the textbook for this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who wasn't planning on majoring in economics because of the lack of attention given to students, making it a very unnecessarily difficult class",
    "Yes! It's important for everyone to take at least one economics course at Yale.",
    "This is a course that one must take in order to pursue a major in economics. I really wish the course would be more accommodating and more helpful in terms of acting as an introductory course. I had no prior background in this course and it was rather difficult for me to grasp all of the concepts presented.",
    "I would highly recommend Micro 115. While it isn't a breeze, it teaches all the fundamentals of Microeconomics that are useful to all students, not just Econ majors. I used most of the things I learned in 115 for understanding concepts in multiple other classes. Overall, the course allowed me to get a better understanding of economics and how I can apply that to the real world. While the lecture isn't very entertaining or engaging, the material is worth the time investment and the things I have learned have proven to be useful outside of class.",
    "Only if they're actually interested in economics or if they need it for a major, because it's too hard to just take if you're interested (my personal opinion).",
    "Yeah I definitely would recommend this class because it helps me understand the basic concepts at play and better grasp what is going on in economics.",
    "It's a foundational course. Take it if you want to know microeconomics, but if you want to really understand\/are very interested in the topic, the seminar version might be more appropriate",
    "Yes. It is a great introduction to the Economics major.",
    "No! Take the seminar.",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory lecture and is good to follow.",
    "I would recommend it because it is such a basic class that most college students take, but I think the class needs serious restructuring.",
    "Yes, fun not to high pressure and a good way to get exposed to basic economic thinking.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have economics experience in highschool",
    "I would recommend it, because it gives a good basis for future exploration of Economics courses and teaches some valuable skills.",
    "No. I would never recomend this course because the professir does not explain concepts very well and more could be learnt from watching youtube videos online. The assesments are not fair and it was overall a bad experience.",
    "Yes, it is a great opportunity to see if economics is going to be a subject you will want to study further.",
    "I would recommend it because it's a requirement for a lot of classes in several disciplines.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to gain a better understanding of econ.",
    "If someone wishes to learn the basics of microeconomics, this is probably the only course to take. Otherwise, it's not a very interesting class.",
    "I'd be very careful with who I recommend this class to. I did not love it, but as a probably English major, it wasn't a class I totally expected myself to love. It's definitely a good way to meet a lot of first-years and study together in the first term, but unless future economics classes are desired, I probably wouldn't recommend it. Much of what I learned was completely unrelated to economics, which I guess is a good thing long term but I probably could've gotten it much better out of other classes where I also learned.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to the subject area and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course, but mostly because I think that most everyone should learn basic economic principles, and the course effectively teaches those. However, it is not particularly interesting\/ intellectually stimulating, in my opinion (either the lecture style or the content of the course)",
    "If you are interested in economics or just want to better understand how we make choices, this course gives a good foundation."
