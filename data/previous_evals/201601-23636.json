    "Basically Chinese 154 (same textbook) but using more other sources -- reading newspaper articles, watching documentaries, and cooking Chinese food! The exams were also different; set up so that you could show what you knew not what you didn't know, took off a lot of the pressure. This semester compared to last there were a lot more homeworks, due almost every single class in addition to all the quizzes.",
    "Take the class to open year 5 classes. You will also learn a lot on the way.",
    "Yes, continue taking Chinese!",
    "I would recommend it, though I'd say it was a lot of work.",
    "CHNS155 is a great course for students who are looking to maintain their advanced Chinese language levels. I took this course after a summer of not speaking, writing, or listening to Chinese, and I was able to really adapt to this course and regain my forgotten Chinese language skills. This course is comprised of 3 essay exams, a final essay exam, 25-minute weekly tutorials, 2 oral presentations, a few essays, daily quizzes, and a few out-of-class activities. Zhou Laoshi is a fantastic professor -- he is so encouraging, creative, and full of positive energy. He does everything he can to make this course fun and interactive for students. You get to cover a lot of really interesting issues about Chinese culture, history, and politics throughout this course. I felt the workload of this course was extremely manageable, compared to previous Chinese classes at Yale. The course is structured so that you each student can learn about what they are interested in -- during each of the exams, you decide what grammar and vocab to study, and what you want to write about. It's very different from previous courses, where you study every single item and are tested objectively on some of them. With this course, you get to choose what you find important or interesting, and figure out a way to combine those pieces of information. Overall, a good course to help maintain your Chinese language skills. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Chinese 155 was a great continuation of Chinese 154. Although it is a lot of work at times, overall it is a terrific course with fantastic instructors and TAs, who will help you to continue improving your Chinese. As long as you are willing to put in the effort, it is a great course."
