    "PHAR 528 01 would help students have a better and deeper understanding of fundamental concepts and recent researches in signal transduction. Each topic talks about specific signaling pathways and helps us realize the complexity of each signaling pathway. Every single breakthrough in research would not only help to build up knowledge but also help clinical research and public health. I would like to recommend PHAR 528 01 to other students.",

    "This course is very helpful in building up my background knowledge of my thesis project. It helped me not only have an overall view of different types of signaling pathways but also some specific examples of signal transduction. My thesis project focuses on Akt signaling pathway. Topics including protein tyrosine kinases, serine\/threonine kinases, serine\/threonine phosphatases ect are all related."
