    "Well it's a requirement for the art major, so you'll have to take it sooner or later as a major. If not an art major I don't think I would recommend it. There are so many other classes to take that are more specialized. But, if you like conceptual art and you like a lot of flexibility, this could be a good thing. Not too much work, but not nothing either. It's what you make of it.",
    "If you're interested in the art major it is a good intro course... however I wouldn't suggest it to be one of the first art classes you take, as it might scare you off (for being a bit ridiculous though not in a terrible way. Excellent as a fifth class.",
    "There are five projects, one every two or three weeks. There isn't a whole lot of work in between those projects, but they'll sneak up on you quickly. Part of the process of the class is learning to explain and justify what you've made, so if you want to turn in a paperclip as your project, you can do that, but be prepared to back yourself up. In all, the class was small, Professor Lehmann was really interesting and knowledgeable. I enjoyed going to this class every M\/W morning and never felt too stressed (except the night before a project was due). You also get to visit a museum or two as a group and watch artsy documentaries. winninggggg.",
    "It's a requirement for the major but I understand you get a different experience with Betbeze as a teacher. This is good if you want to deal more with conceptual issues than craft or technique, and if you are a non-art major looking to think artistically without needing a huge amount of technical skill.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. It's a requirement for Art majors, but don't dread it, it really is a lot of fun. Take it early, too, it is a great foundation for conceptual work.",
    "I would recommend this class if they were to take it with this same professor, though, as stated in a previous response, I don't know how consistent the classes are from semester to semester and professor to professor, so I'm not 100 percent sure if I would recommend it unconditionally."
