   "comments": [
    "The course is very enriching and the discussions were very constructive. Since the instructor presents challenging research questions, my fellow students are motivated to use a wide range of tools to tackle problems and we learn from each other.I highly recommend the course to students of any discipline, as it helps to stimulate graduate students to think of new projects that are beyond their comfort zone.",
    "Social History of the Silk Road is a great class for everyone with a serious interest in Silk Road research, whether having a background in Chinese history or not. It provides a great survey on current research, key questions, debates and problems, and also gives each student the opportunity to explore her or his more specific Silk Road interests. Altogether, it was a seminar that was very challenging, productive, and intellectually stimulating. And, prepare for a long reading list, particularly when it comes to the Sogdiens, the most important traders on the Silk Route!"

   "comments": [
    "I am now familiar with a wide array of research tools, online databases, manuscript archives and bibliographies. I am also aware of the various resources and methodological approaches to gather materials and identify new sources.",
    "I have been interested in the Silk Road, and fascinated by one particular Silk Road community, for a very long time. So it was great to finally have the opportunity to take a Silk Road seminar, and familiarize myself with Silk Road research debates. I could connect both the mid-term and the final paper to my dissertation topic, and delve a bit into subjects that will eventually turn into future dissertation chapters, hence, this was tremendously productive.However, I would much prefer to have more time for the final paper \u0096 the program should provide more time for writing final papers in general. It would have been great, and very intellectually beneficial, to have the opportunity to write an extensive, thoroughly researched, 40-50 page long publishable paper on my topic, and consult a much wider range of both primary sources and secondary literature - which is usually something that takes several months of pure research to accomplish."
