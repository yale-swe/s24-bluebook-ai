   "comments": [
    "Great professor, good tests (reflective of class material and homework) Discussion sections were too long.",
    "Great Intro course to Epi",
    "i am happy with its structure",
    "Strengths of the course include the textbook, which made concepts very easy to understand, the chronology\/progression of the course, which felt intuitive, and of course, the subject matter. Weaknesses include the underdevelopment of some concepts, such as bias. The emphasis on examples was too heavy, especially given that many of the information was only covered over the course of one lecture. Time should have been used better to maximize the lecture and present the material, as opposed to discussing lengthy examples.",
    "this course is really good. Have learnt a lot.",
    "The strengths are that it provides a comprehensive overview of epidemiology; allows for further discussion in the discussion sessions; large body of TAs and a professor; frequent review and \"tying it all together\" lectures. The weakness of the course is that it is presented in an overly simplistic manner - the lectures were often deceivingly simple, but additional nuances would come up in the discussion session, homework, and tests. It would have been better to start struggling with some of the nuances during lecture; it would be good if the professor assumed all had read the textbook beforehand and worked through more math and thinking questions in detail. The journal article examples are less helpful. The early problem sets were too long, especially when calculations needed to be typed.",
    "I would say the discussions were a bit too long and unnecessary most of the time, except maybe before an exam. Sometimes the lectures also seemed like a repetition of what was in the textbook, which would make it difficult to pay attention the entire time. Other than that, the course was good and had very useful information.",
    "Homework questions took a while but they were very helpful. Material presented well in class.",
    "strengths: instructor's knowledge and enthusiasm; very adaptable weaknesses: over-reliance on TAs for answer keys and being source of all knowledge; test grading was inconsistent",
    "The class achieves its goal: a very basic introduction to epidemiology. The material is fairly straight-forward, and the class presents it as such. The lectures feel far too long for the information covered. The class did not feel like an efficient use of time.",
    "This class was very straightforward and clear, spelling out the information and providing examples. The pattern of coursework was consistent and assignments were helpful in learning material. Overall this class was very good.",
    "The class was very large and attempting to have it discussion-style really did not work.",
    "Very good introductory course. I enjoyed the way it was structured. Maybe more time spent making us create our own study designs instead of just rote memorization and homework problems. The homework did help drive the points home, though.",
    "This was a great class. Learned a lot about epi and Dr. Niccolai did a great job of explaining concepts.",
    "Homeworks sometimes were too time-consuming. But anyway very helpful",
    "This was the class I was looking most forward to. Professor Niccolai taught it well and covered the book well in her lectures.",
    "Good course. Well organized.fair workload.",
    "You learn a lot, but it can be a challenge at times. I felt adequately prepared for the final though and had mastered all of the concepts before the end of the semester. There is a lot of work and reading to do, make sure you keep up! Take detailed lecture notes because she pulls most of the questions from powerpoints and things said in lecture.",
    "Strengths: -TAs -Having homework due weekly was frustrating, but good in the long run for increasing understanding of the material. It also allowed for a good amount of materials to study from when it was time for exams. -Good amount of hw\/practice problems. Hw\/practice exams were appropriate level of difficulty to prepare for exam(as opposed to having exams be much harder) -Exams were graded and returned very quickly -Lecture slides were always available ahead of time Weaknesses:",
    "I think the homework did a good job in reinforcing concepts that were learned in class.",
    "Class was way too large, tests were hard and reasons for point reduction were not adequately explained",
    "Course was excellently structured to facilitate learning of the material. Weekly Homework and discussion + 4 tests allowed for internalization of material. Homework was appropriate length and difficulty. Textbook and supporting reading selection was good as well. Textbook was very readable. Lectures were great as well. My only complaint is that sometimes questions on the tests were worded in a confusing way, so that even if I knew the material it was hard to tell what instructor was asking for.",
    "Should not be simply reading through the PowerPoints in class - should be more concept-driven",
    "The course is very helpful especially for students like me who have no previous exposure to epidemiology. The homework is frequent but it is very pragmatic and excellent for test preparation. I would request that a few formula be put on each test, not just the third and the final tests. As someone who is not pursing a career which will involve me directly with epidemiology, I was often frustrated by having to memorize all the formulae instead of being able to focus on grasping the material conceptually. Overall, I learned something new every day and left the course with a great toolkit for analyzing my own and others' research.",
    "Strengths: good overview of basic epidemiology; the TA sessions were helpful to solidify and review material Weaknesses: the lectures were, more or less, recapitulations of the textbook chapters we read the night before, so it was not clear to me that the lectures added much more to the course Improvements: it might be more engaging if there were more project-based tasks, instead of (or in addition to) the tests. For example, tasks that required us to design our own studies or critique those that had already been done might make the material come alive more.",
    "The course was a good intro to the understanding of Epi. I personally liked the way that the course was structured. A major strength is that we used a lot of real world examples when learning concepts instead of just looking at numbers.",
    "The course was very well organized and structured. It had a great flow and it was easy to connect the concepts throughout the course. Although the many tests and homeworks made the course more labor intensive than other courses, I think they really helped to solidify the information and made studying for the final much easier. A weakness would be that the homework had to be typed, which made it more time-consuming. For the future, I would suggest that the calculation questions could also be handwritten, but then a scanned copy would be submitted to the TFs. Otherwise, the course was great!",
    "The topics were interesting but the professor had a bad habit of going off tangents and not managing time wisely. There were many lectures where she would go over her alloted time but not even finish the slides in lecture.",
    "Appreciated the Friday sections. My TA was awesome!",
    "The structure of the course is conducive to learning\/reinforcing a good deal of information. Discussion sections were generally very helpful.",
    "Among the strengths of this class, are that the lecture and homework assignments were very helpful at helping to cement concepts. Unfortunately, the tests often were quite different from the homework or practice tests that we had seen before. Additionally, for many of the tests we were not given enough time, which resulted in numerous people not finishing the first exam and others rushing through it, so that it became less about what you knew and more about how fast you could take an exam.",
    "I enjoyed the course and leaned a lot of the fundamentals. Some of the class felt like plug and chug but most was conceptual. Maybe some modern epi studies e.g. Computational epi can be included to review",
    "I really enjoyed the layout of lecture. Easy to follow, understand, and apply to external material",
    "The class is well structured and fair. I came away having a core understanding of the concepts and I felt like that these concepts built on each other throughout the semester.",
    "Very good!",
    "Need more Examples and Cases. And PPT would be more in detail. Courss are like in a rush to finish.",
    "very good and useful",
    "I really liked the class! It was well organized and structured. It seemed like there was good communication between the professor and TFs. The TFs also seemed to be carefully and appropriately chosen. Additionally, the expectations for what students needed to do were clear, as I felt that by studying and learning the provided materials, I had a pretty good chance of doing well on the assessments (until the final).",
    "I enjoyed this course and learned a great deal. Strengths: material covered in clear, concise way. Weakness: the tests felt unnecessarily tricky at some points.",
    "Strengths = The amount that I learned in this course! I learned more in this course than I did in any of my other courses.",
    "Strengths- homework prepares you for tests; strong introduction to epidemiology Weaknesses- inconsistent grading, sometimes confusing instruction is given on certain subjects",
    "the question in the exam could be more clearly stated.",
    "Good overview of epi. Homeworks were often too long with a lot of calculations that we were never asked to do on a test (Chi square test? How many homework's there with that question and it was never on a test). Tests had unnecessarily confusing wording simply meant to trip us up. TA's were very helpful and it's a good idea to keep going over the homework's in each section.",
    "I wish the section time was utilized to help us get a better understanding of the concepts and not just to grade homework problems we already did. The phrasing on tests and homework problems were at times confusing.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Niccolai is great. Weakness: n\/a",
    "The slide presentations were good and had valuable information. The textbook was also helpful.",
    "Standardize what is covered in TA sections",
    "This course is really a corner stone for all of the other courses at YSPH...which is why it is required. While it was often times very frustrating to understand, it was really interesting and engaging. Having it right after an early morning biostats class is definitely a challenge though. One of the biggest strengths and weaknesses is the homework assignments. There are essential for understanding the material but extremely long and sometimes redundant. On top of that, stumbling through a lengthy assignment is not beneficial at a certain point. The testing method is also a strength and weakness. Having just one midterm and final would be a real challenge with so much new and complex information. Breaking the class into sections and having 4 exams was helpful for those who did not pick up on the material as quickly. At the same time, it is a constant flow of homework and exams that can be exhausting when factoring other classes. One idea to consider, because the material is so new for so many of us, is to make the first test worth less than the 2nd and 3rd. That way a poor grade doesn't set you so far back for the rest of the semester. One issue was with the TAs being on the same page. Often times talking to classmates you hear about their TA telling them one thing when your own TA says another. This only causes confusion for students and not everyone is aware of everything. The TA slides are also not uniform in discussion sections, which can be frustrating when studying and trying to go through six sets of slides on a topic. I would suggest taking a page from the Biostatistics 505 TAs and have one person make a deck each week with input from everyone. That way everyone, especially the students, are on the same page and all of the helpful hints and tips each TA has can be given to everyone.",
    "daily hw was nice",
    "The Friday sessions were extremely useful for learning the course material. However, the grading system for the assignments is not conducive to learning. I once received a Fail for not providing an interpretation. If the homework was graded on a % basis, I would have received >80%. So is it better for me just to 'attempt' all questions, or should the purpose be for me to actually attempt to get the questions correct? Additionally, I feel that the questions on the test are unclear (specifically the Toxic Shock Syndrome question on Test 3)",
    "Good course, helps one to learn the foundation of epidemiology.",
    "The class gave a good overview of epidemiology and provides the foundation for other courses at YSPH. We had a lot of homework but it was good for reinforcing the material.",
    "Strengths: Homework problems were well designed and ensured understanding of the course material from the class. Linda Niccolai was engaging during the lectures. Improvement: I would appreciate it if exams were reviews during lecture time right after we got it back. There was a log time lag between when the test was returned and when we reviewed the content of the exam. Also, the class size was too large. (during lecture)",
    "I appreciated how structured the class was. However, it would be nice if there was not homework or a test due every week as it made the first semester very difficult. I would also recommend the final to have some kind of cheat sheet as there is a lot to learn and re-learn during finals",
    "The class was pretty fair and pretty interesting but a little difficult. I would say it was useful and I enjoyed it for the most part.",
    "it is good, very related to the real world survey.",
    "Strengths: keeps students \"on their toes\" - because there is homework due at the end of every week that ensures all material covered in lecture is understood. Discussion sections are a great supplement. Very well organized (excellent organization of course topics, in fact) and structured course. Assumes no prior knowledge of epidemiology and the few statistical concepts that were covered. Slides very helpful and well organized. Homework assignments were great learning tools. Weaknesses: the lighting of the room during lecture is not optimal in my opinion (Winslow auditorium). It would be nice if we cover midterm review questions\/practice test questions and then have people ask their questions in the end. Exams were a little \"picky\"--would be nice if TFs reflected this pickiness in grading homework.",
    "The course was successful in teaching the basics of epidemiology in a clear manner in a manageable timeframe. I feel like I can walk away with a better understanding of research articles that I read. The examples were somewhat dry even though there are great, more relevant articles that would make excellent examples for class. I absolutely loved how we had exams throughout the semester instead of just two. It was very helpful in learning the material! The weaknesses of the course was how the professor stonewalled any attempts to discuss points taken off on exam and the vagueness of certain exam questions.",
    "The homework was helpful, sections are helpful. The examples used in class were helpful. It would be useful if sections reviewed more topics before going over the homework.",
    "The lectures require more interactions - walking through slides and feeding the materials is dry and insufficient sometimes. Learning objectives are clear and well communicated - good integration between lectures and discussion sections.",
    "I really like the design of the course. Completing the weekly homework assignment allows you to apply the concepts learned in class which reinforces the learning in lecture and forces you to keep up with what is being learned. When it is time to take an exam a lot of the concepts you are already very familiar with and you don't have to \"cram\". I feel like I really learned a lot along the way. The only complaint I have is that the length of time to be spent on the homework assignments really varied - sometimes they were very long and sometimes they were pretty short. Additionally, I thought section was very helpful to get questions answered in a smaller setting than lecture. I also liked having multiple exams, which puts less pressure on any single exam. Even though we covered a lot of material I thought this made it more manageable. i thought the exams were fair. My only criticism of the final exam was that all of the problems with calculating incidence rates had lots of complicated numbers for person-time (like 678945 instead of 650,000) which resulted in me doing the calculations several times so as to be sure I was not typing a number into my calculator wrong. I know partial credit is given but I didn't want to lose points for a calculation error, so I think it wouldn't have detracted from the difficulty of the problem to make the numbers simpler. The first section that is designed just to get to know your TA\/classmates could be cut out too.",
    "The homework was great. They really reenforced what we were learning in class.",
    "-Strengths: it is an easy course to start the year with and to start studying again. Very accessible -Weaknesses: maybe too slow . The textbook is not useful.",
    "Homework assignments were long, but great reinforcers of the material learned each week Wish we could do more case studies!",
    "I think the structure of this course is excellent. I learned a lot, given that I have never taken an epidemiology course before. Exams were fair and homework was very helpful in understanding the material.",
    "I feel like the course set forth the principles of epi in a very understandable and accessible way. The slides were nicely organized and easy to follow during class and for future studying. Examples were nicely integrated in to the conceptual framework. I liked the amount of time spent on examples, and don't think more would necessarily be helpful. I did enjoy the few times during class that we were encouraged to talk to our neighbors (I think it was called a buzzgroup?) in a critical thinking exercise, particularly in the study design section. I think this could be integrated more into the course as a way to engage for those that are less inclined to raise their hands in a lecture setting.",
    "This class was an extremely effective introductory course. The use of outside papers to illustrate concepts was very helpful. The course was so helpful in providing a foundation of knowledge for my other courses.",
    "I really liked the organization of the class and the order of the lectures. Material was broken up into related chunks and that made it easier to learn. Homeworks sometimes felt excessive but I always felt very prepared for the exams, so it's a trade-off. I had no idea how much I didn't actually know about epi before the course, and now I feel very confident in my understanding.",
    "I thought it started out very strong, but it definitely felt like there was a noticeable decline over the last few months in terms of the clarity of the lectures.",
    "Very challenging, very important. A lot of homework and very unclear picky grading.",
    "Excellent introductory course to epidemiology. I feel that it covered just the right amount of material, and covered it thoroughly. I feel that the discussion sections can be improved. Reviewing the homework is important but perhaps only taking half of each section to go over homework and then review class material the other half of section. I felt that most of the exams were fair. There were only a couple of short-answer questions on exam 3 were confusing, so I suggest to be completely clear on what you're looking for in an answer.",
    "I believe the information was clear to follow and accessible. I think too much emphasis was put on grading Test grades were not a reflection of how well I knew the material but of speed and remembering buzz words. This took my attention away from understanding the material in a useful way.",
    "Great course. It was challenging but I learned so many skills.",
    "Strengths: useful course, logical progression for learning material, engaging professor. Weaknesses: variation between TFs\/sections, confusing wording or unclear expectations on exams, policy of not correcting wrong grading on exams.",
    "I thought this was a well-crafted course. It built upon itself in a logical and cohesive way that was satisfying to learn. It is a crucial core topic for public health students, and I feel like I have learned it well. The homeworks and exams were fairly straightforward and logical progressions from the homework. I was never a fan of the multiple choice\/true false sections of the exams; I felt like I needed to spend more time trying to figure out exactly what the question was asking rather than actually applying my knowledge to a situation. Also, for the exams, the shotgun approach of 'write down everything you possibly know about this topic' suggested by the profession and teaching assistants is all fine, but also not very applicable in any real-world setting. I feel like more specific questions or tighter answering guidelines might give students a better idea about what they get right and wrong. In terms of specifics, the powerpoints were well crafted, though sometimes frustrating when there were unanswered questions left hanging on the powerpointsit's good to challenge the class, but it would be nice of the facts were there. I don't have a laptop, and prefer not to take notes on the actual slides due to my own learning preferences, so I found myself searching through notes to find answers to these questions more often than I would've liked.",
    "Strengths: Straightforward, clear concepts Weakness: Sometimes class goes off tangent",
    "I didn't like that there were so many tests. It was hard to let information absorb and I felt like I needed to memorize and not really learn and understand things just for the sake of the test.",
    "The weekly homework is helpful for learning concepts, but it might be helpful if they were a bit shorter. The slides were helpful for studying.",
    "I was impressed with the amount of material we were able to cover in a short amount of time. I really learned a lot in this class. Having the lecture slides on the class website was very helpful. I appreciated that we were able to follow the lectures with the powerpoint. The studies chosen as examples were excellent. One thing that I found frustrating was that the lectures seemed basic, which gave me a false confidence when it came to take the exams, which were, I think, very challenging and tricky. I wish I knew how to master the material more than I did. I wish the teaching assistants had more time to review the concepts we learned in class rather than spending the entire time on homework problems. This was changed later in the semester, and I think that helped. Quick practice problems (like true or false\/multiple choice), covered during the discussion section would be very helpful. This might ensure that we are getting a better grasp of the tricky concepts. The homework problems were also helpful, but they were extremely long.",
    "Great overview of epidemiology - the professor covered a wide range of material that was well organized and well presented in a comprehensive manner. Lectures were engaging, and the textbook always useful for exam review. The re-use of articles through multiple sections of the course was a strong teaching tool. Discussion sections could involve more engaging activity in addition to homework correction.",
    "The weekly homework, although arduous, really helped me learn the didactic material from class. The division of tests throughout the semester was broken down into modules and was helpful in reinforcing the material learned. As someone without any public health background, this class was a great introduction to epidemiology.",
    "Great introduction! We spent so much time on completing homeworks I wish that was a larger portion of the grade. I appreciate multiple tests with limited amount of information on each-- great structure.",
    "The grading scheme. The consistency between the practice problems\/homework with actual exams.",
    "I thought this course did a good job providing an introduction to epidemiology. Some of the homework assignments took a very long time, but being able to go over the answers in discussion section was helpful.",
    "This class was necessary to understand designing and conducting epidemiological studies. The weekly homework and biweekly exams were very helpful in coalescing the concepts of the course.",
    "I feel as though I learned an immense amount through this course. I loved how it was applicable to the real world and I thought that that instruction was very straightforward and conveyed the material well.",
    "Strengths - great lecture slides; articles selected for each lecture are helpful in understanding the epidemiological methods; frequent exams are helpful (although I didn't like them very much) because they prevented me from falling behind and forgetting previous lectures. Weaknesses - none.",
    "There were a couple of \"tying it all together\" lectures that weren't helpful.",
    "strength: - a great introductory course; material covered is accessible to students of all levels - homework is graded pass\/fail and students get to discuss the answers in the section which helps to clarify concepts weakness: - students in my section were often confused about the wording of the homework questions",
    "Great homeworks and helpful lectures. Great overall course if interested in epi.",
    "The course design was really good. I liked the idea of having homework and multiple exams. However, few question in the exams were very subjective and might be interpreted in different ways. I think the exam would improve if the theoretical questions (not the quantitative) in the exam are in multiple choice format.",
    "Overall, I found the class to be a good introduction to epidemiology course. Strengths included organized slides and structure to the class, useful examples, weekly reinforcement through homework and class discussion, reasonable exams, and nice \"wrap-up\" lectures for each segment. The only weakness I would note was very long homework assignments (which were shortened for the second half of the semester, and were equally effective). In terms of improvement, it would be great to have the required textbook accessible through the Classes V2 site. I heard it was available through the library from a peer, but it would have been nice to have seen more information about that on Classes v2. I also appreciated that the homework assignments were graded based on attempt rather than accuracy, which helped take some pressure off for what was relatively all new information for me.",
    "This course is a very well-organized introduction to epidemiology. The weekly homework keeps students up-to-date with the material and the exams are very fair.",
    "The course was very helpful in ensuring that students know the foundations of epidemiology. The course was very work load heavy but was beneficial in the end."

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is very approachable and a good lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda is a really great instructor. Her interest and passion for this field is apparent, but she approaches it from a perspective that makes it interesting for students who aren't necessarily interested in epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0good instructor.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Good professor! Funny as well. I would say some weaknesses would be in her responses to student's answers - I felt like sometimes she was not explaining things well enough when someone questioned something from the lecture or a concept. This was only on occasion though.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great professor. Presented material and answered questions clearly.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0very dynamic, engaging, and passionate professor!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is very passionate about her work, but I found her an ineffective lecturer. Her style of teaching, and tone of voice dragged out the presentation of information that could have been more effectively communicated in a shorter amount of time.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was the perfect instructor for this course. She laid everything out clearly, was good at answering questions, and was very responsive to student feedback on course mechanics. I'm very glad she taught this class this semester!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is obviously very knowledgeable and passionate, but she consistently held us ten minutes after class was supposed to end. That was with her rushing through her last five to ten slides. Her time management could be improved. Also, attempting to stimulate discussion with over one hundred people was not a productive use of the time she needed. However, her lectures were very interesting and I learned a lot from her.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was very knowledgeable and I appreciated her providing examples for everything. Using the same few studies to show us all the different features was great. Really clarified things for me.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was an excellent professor. She was always willing to go the extra mile to explain basic concepts and did not get frustrated when students still did not understand. She is also very relatable with the students and this makes for a good teaching environment.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Absolutely great",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Excellent professor. Very kind, knowledgeable, and makes it extremely easy to understand complex concepts.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very qualified. Involves students in discussion, which is valuable",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very knowledgeable in the subject matter. Not the most empathetic about grading (don't even bother trying to earn back points on an exam). Does a pretty good job of keeping students engaged during lecture. Her examples and readings to go along with lecture are highly relevant to the material, I really appreciated that aspect of the course.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: -Always had slides available prior to lecture -Asked for feedback halfway through semester and actually took it (by making homeworks a little shorter) -Lectures were organized and easy to follow",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The professor encouraged discussion within class and did well in teaching the broader concepts. She also illustrated why epidemiology was important to learn.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Needs to be more receptive to students wanting to come talk to her. Should offer full answer keys to test after course is completed",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Tries to stump you on tests.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda is a great instructor. Lectures were relevant, informative, and presented the material in an interesting way. Feedback was sufficient and timely. My only complaint is the way some of the questions on tests were structured (see response above).",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a wonderful professor and makes lectures enjoyable to attend and learn from.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Good, but only reads through the PowerPoints in class. Not very accessible to students for meeting to discuss the course.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was great. I really liked that she took the time to really explain concepts and use personal examples. Dr. Niccolai was also very approachable and that aspect made it easy to ask questions about things I did not understand.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai explained concepts very clearly and made class feel very relaxed. Her expectations for students were also very clear and exams were a true reflection of her lectures. The only weakness was going over class time.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is very disjointed and absentminded. I don't think she's a good teacher. She obviously knows her topic but she does not communicate it well to her students. She swings between giving students too much time consuming homework that is not relevant to the exam and to too little homework that does not prepare us at all. Her lectures are not on point with what we are tested on.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof Niccolai was great! Enjoyed her sense of humor and the topics discussed in class. All of it made learning Epi easier.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai's strengths reside in that she actually is an epidemiologist, so she can use a lot of real-life examples. However, her teaching can be very convoluted at times. I think she also could do a better job of finishing class on time, as most classes actually went over the allotted time amount.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I really enjoyed her lectures, however, I think she needs to be more open in discussions with students about exams. She really does not like to discuss points lost on exams, but students sometimes have very valid concerns or can show that their answer matches what was covered in lecture, and I think she needs to be more open to discussing these matters.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She encouraged interaction, provided feedback, and was organized and prepared",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I very much appreciated Dr. Niccolai. She truly challenged us this semester and had high and reasonable expectations. I also enjoyed getting to know her a little outside of the classroom. We really got our moneys worth with this class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The professor is very clear and her lectures are very easy to follow. She is engaging and her notes are helpful resources. I am thankful for how accessible she made this course!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very good!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0excellent. very good instrctor",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I enjoyed Linda's lectures. I think the lectures were well organized and contained only information that she felt was essential to learning the concepts. She also makes herself very accessible to students (something that I failed to take advantage of but wish I had). I didn't like that she constantly went over time. Once or twice wouldn't have been a big deal, but we let out 10 minutes late almost every class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda is a great teacher who really helped students learn the material in a clear way - I like her style of teaching. However, I would say that she could be a little more open to points on the tests, especially when it seemed like there was some variability in the way things were graded.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Explains concepts clearly; could be more available to students, especially regarding questions about grades.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: lots of examples, connects with students, engages critical thinking",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Good knowledge of epi. Tests don't need to be as confusing as they were made to be and should mirror examples we've done.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is a really knowledgable teacher and had some great rel life examples of the concepts we were learning. I did not find her super accessible though and she was hard to reach.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was great. Her ability to teach the information was helpful.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very clear, nice examples, enthusiastic instructor",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The professor seemed very inflexible in understanding and accommodating the needs of her students. She was often short in her communication and vague outside of class instruction. The professor also consistently went over the class end time by 5 to 10 minutes, sometimes longer. I don't believe there were more than 3 classes throughout the entire semester that she ended class on time or early. This seemed very disrespectful of the time of students as it was not considering that students have other things to do after that class including other classes, jobs or commitments. Improvements she could make would be understanding that her students are Master's level students, not undergraduates, and that many are professionals in their own right with many commitments outside of class that are equally important. With this understanding she could plan her lectures accordingly to end on time, and also be willing to accommodate students when necessary and be explicit in her instructions to students when attempting to make those accommodations rather than putting the students in the position of having to continue asking for clarification.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is very instructive, in a way very understandable.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very entertaining professor!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai has a real challenge every semester teaching a full auditorium of students brand new material. She handles this well with her lectures and engaging with the class as best as possible. I think some would consider a more hardline professor but that is not always a bad thing. She knows how the class works well and sticks too it. Lectures can feel long at some points, especially having them twice a week, and some of the material does not get as much attention as it probably deserves. This is where the TAs should come in for discussion sections but the assignments are so long that there is often little time to really walk through any pain points in discussion section. There are certainly many office hours available during the week but with such a busy schedule it is not always feasible to get to these. Shortening the assignments would be best so more time can be focused on what people don't understand. There is a ton of information learned in the class and it all feels essential, but if there is anything that can be cut out, that would help as well.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0she was cool",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0My only qualm with Dr. Niccolai was getting ahold of her to ask her questions; she would always be in a rush after class and declined to answer our questions. Otherwise, she is very smart and good at explaining things.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda makes the information pretty clear. She goes over on time a lot which is annoying- because it will be 10 minutes after class and she's still trying to lecture. The material was presented well though.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: Very engaging. Good at explaining concepts. Improvement: She could spend more time going through examples on the board.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda was a great professor who was always engaging and provided great examples",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is very intelligent and engaging! I thought she was a great lecturer although she tends to go over the class time by a few minutes with her numerous slides. I think a little better time management so that students can get out on time is beneficial.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0very good",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: Engaging, extremely knowledgeable, responsive.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a great professor that really knows her material. I wish she would use better examples in class. Her face and voice are much more animated when she talks about her own work. She should incorporate more of this into her lectures!!! I also wish she would include more global health examples in her class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She does a good job of explaining the foundational topics and building upon them. I found her teaching style to be very effective.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0There are at times she cannot answer a student's question in class and not follow up with the class in a later session of an update - is frustrating. However, she is very honest about her opinions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda is a great instructor! I really enjoyed her lectures and the style of teaching. I think she does a good job of handling in class questions without sacrificing class time. Sometimes people would ask several questions about the same issue and while a few individuals in the class may be confused about the particular issue the majority of the class was not confused. I think it's important for a teacher to answer questions but also draw the line and determine when it is time to go back to lecturing because there is more material to cover. If she teaches any other courses I would want to take them just to be in her class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was great. I think the one thing I remained confused on up until the end of the course was differential and non-differential bias. I think this could have been clearer. Does it work differently if it is information or selection bias? If so, make this really clear. I found everything else super clear. I really liked the examples you used. I also really liked how if people started asking repetitive\/irrelevant\/dumb questions, you got sassy. Most of the class was annoyed by these questions, so they appreciated your willingness to keep the class moving.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0-Strengths: good explanations -Weaknesses: spends too much time on discussion with the class rather than explaining some of the difficult concepts.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very intelligent and professional Such an amazing teacher",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is a good lecturer and is instructive.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I LOVE Dr. Niccolai! She is great and so responsive to our questions, both in class and in office hours. She gets us thinking during class and applies the material to practical\/real life situations, which is great. My only complaint is that sometimes during class, students will ask a lot of questions that are a bit tangential (e.g. relating the material to a particular hypothetical scenario) - while I think this can be useful, the discussion sometimes becomes excessive and results in us being let out of class late. I think it would be better to cut these discussion shorter by encouraging students to bring them up during office hours or after class, to ensure that all material is covered during class time.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda was an engaging and patient lecturer. I thought she fostered a comfortable and encouraging classroom setting, and I looked forward to epi classes. I appreciated how she encouraged and took all questions, but there were a few times where the question a person was asking would be better addressed on an individual scale and I think it slightly took away from the class's momentum. My suggestion would be to encourage those questions to be asked during office hours\/after class (which I think you've done before, but to continue to encourage).",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor was so good at tailoring her lectures to students of all backgrounds and was extremely patient in her teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda was very personable during lecture and I appreciated that. The course was a bit of a dry subject, so it could be hard to pay attention at times, but she always had enthusiasm and was engaged in her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Instructor clearly explains concepts Too many questions are answered per session",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was a good lecturer and I felt like I got a lot out of our class time. However, I feel like sometimes we got hung up on student questions that were not entirely relevant to the course content.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a bit intimidating but know's the subject very well. She read a lot from the slides.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was always prepared for class, and was open to students' questions. I thought it was good to allow student feedback during lecture to hear questions and knowledge they could add from their experiences. However, sometimes student input lasted long and it took awhile to get back to the lecture. Also, class regularly went past the allotted time, so I only suggest to be aware of the clock. But overall Dr. Niccolai was a great instructor, and provided relevant examples through research articles which was a useful learning tool.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor was good at articulate the concepts in straightforward language.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: very likeable, approachable, clearly cared about students, tried to make course interesting. Weaknesses: could get off topic, often ran out of time or went over.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was a terrific instructor, and was great at explaining and expressing the concepts associated with epidemiology. I have nothing to say about the actual teaching style, I think that was as effective as it could be. However, I feel like she frequently got derailed by student questions, and would up rushing through the end of a lecture because she spent so long in a thought experiment with a few students during classtime. I appreciate these peer insights, but I feel like certain questions or comments can be made after class, on a more conversational level. Though Dr. Niccolai cannot control what students ask, I think some greater discretion in answering or humoring tangents could be helpful to the flow of the class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strenghts: Entertaining, clear explanations Weakenss: Goes off tangent sometimes",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I enjoyed Dr. Niccolai personally, however many of my classmates were concerned and unsatisfied. I have heard people say that they feel she is unapproachable and can be harsh at times. Which I have seen firsthand.So although my experience was generally positive I know this is not how many of my classmates experienced the class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great professor. Explained all course topics very well, would recommend to all students in the future!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai's office hours were helpful to attend over the course of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I thought the lectures were clear. The instructor seemed approachable and open to questions. The only comment I have is with regards to time. I was frustrated when the instructor showed up a few minutes late to class on occasion. For at least one class, we were kept a few minutes later than the course time even though she had come a few minutes late. I wish that she respected the time of the class more. I sometimes have meetings at 12 or have things to get to after class and it's stressful to not stick to the schedule. I think there were times when the class went off on tangents or a small detail was discussed at length when it didn't seem very important to the course. I understand it's nice to keep things interesting, but I felt we went off topic when we were already having difficulty covering all the material during the hour and 20 minutes we had.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is very well-organized and engaging. She presents well and explains concepts very clearly. She's good at involving students in lecture, which is impressive given the size of the class. She provided great feedback and was very accommodating during her office hours.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is engaging and likable. She did a good job engaging students during lectures and was responsive to questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was a great instructor. Her lectures are clear with distinct breaks making it easy to understand exactly what is supposed to be learned. She follows the slides directly which is great when studying. One-on-one Dr. Niccolai is helpful, nice, and understanding. However, she can be intimidating in the lecture setting. She tends to call people out when they make mistakes.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: Instructor was able to connect course material to real-world applications of epidemiology. Instructor has a clear passion for her work and the field of epidemiology. Limitations: Instructor creates an tense environment in the course by being unapproachable during lecture and office hours. Instructor highly encouraged the students to seek help from the teaching fellows; however, the comprehension of epidemiology material varied across the teaching fellows making it difficult find the correct teaching fellow to ask questions. Teaching fellows were not consistent in posting up powerpoint presentations from the Friday sessions. Some teaching fellows took 2-3 weeks to post a homework session.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I liked that she was very responsive to student feedback, and after mid-course evaluations, she began to include more real-world examples in her lectures which I found helpful.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was very detailed in her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very clear and focused while also being approachable and funny. She knew her students' names which I also appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was great. Her lectures were always concise and her delivery is very effective. She follows the textbook for the most part, but adds new information on the slides to make the lectures \"worth\" attending.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Sometimes it seemed as if the instructor was not confident in what was being presented, and it made me feel less confident as well. I really liked the case studies that she presented in class, and I do think I learned a lot from Dr. Niccolai's class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0strengths: - is an engaging professor; even though this was a large lecture course, Dr. Niccolai always managed to get the students to actively participate - uses plenty of examples during lectures which made concepts easier to grasp weaknesses: - lectures would sometimes run overtime",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Easy to understand lectures. Instructor sometimes struggles to provide clear answers to students questions.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great teacher, very good listener. I would love to take other courses with her.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was a thoughtful and organized professor. Strengths included staying on topic during lectures, having organized slides, building appropriately from one concept to the next, offering the pass\/fail homework system, and using good examples and review opportunities throughout the lectures. Perhaps my greatest grievance had to do with the way Dr. Niccolai would respond to questions at times. Sometimes, her responses were sharp or a bit belittling if you did not understand what she had been trying to say, and unless you were willing to ask for clarification regardless, you could easily feel put off about asking for further clarification. I could not tell if those were moments of when she may have felt frustrated with our lack of understanding, but regardless, I would encourage her to respond in a way that just answers the question.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was very effective this semester - I felt as though I really learned the material well. I appreciate how much outside reading she asked of us, as it gave us exposure to a variety of fields of study. She is a charismatic speaker and easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The only improvement I have for Dr. Niccolai is when answering students questions, she should do so without belittling the student. It was a bit alarming to see the way she would respond to students during class in a way that does not motivate students to do so during lecture time."

    "I would recommend this one to my fellow students. It is the most useful course I have taken for the first semester.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was a helpful overview of a fundamental aspect of public health, and the instructor and TFs go out of their way to help you understand the material.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It has a lot of useful information and is essential for any public health professional.",
    "tough course but you learn a lot. very useful just be careful to follow exact wording at all times; this is no place to be creative or try to apply interdisciplinary knowledge",
    "This is a required course for a reason: you will learn a lot, but wouldn't necessarily choose the course for its own merits. Lectures are not necessary, and even detract from learning the information presented. With that being said, the TAs can make this class manageable even if you only attend section.",
    "Although this is a required class I would still recommend it as it clearly provides important information for any future public health professional.",
    "Really good introduction to epidemiological concepts. It really helps me in all my other classes as well. I would definitely recommend this class and definitely recommend this teacher.",
    "Great course. Try to do some background on your TA. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend. the course was interesting and useful for future work",
    "This course is great for anyone wishing to learn the basics of Epidemiology. I would highly recommend it to fellow students",
    "Good course. Fair workload.Provides the basic foundations of epidemiology in a clear and concise way.",
    "You need to take the class and Niccolai is a pretty good professor. Expect it to be challenging at times, but know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel! Everything begins to make sense over time as the concepts really do build on each other.",
    "Course is required for all first years. Even if it wasn't, I'd recommend it because it is important to have a good foundational knowledge in Epi.",
    "It is good for an overview of epidemiology, but could be taught better",
    "I believe the course is required but I would recommend taking it even if it isn't required. It gave me an entirely new perspective on infectious and chronic diseases and overlapped very well with CDE 505 and BIS 505. It piqued some of my personal curiosities, and informed my scholarly approach to others' research that I will use for the rest of my career.",
    "I would recommend it. It's an effective, albeit dry, way to learn about basic epidemiology.",
    "I would summarize this course as the beginning concepts of epidemiology. I would recommend this course to fellow students because it helps us to understand how studies were written and conducted. It also made reading journal articles easier to understand.",
    "The course is an excellent introduction to epidemiology. It teaches you a lot of things in a short amount of time. Be prepared to work if you want to do well in the class, but resources are always available should you need help.",
    "Better primary instructor please.",
    "Justifiably required for the MPH program. Great intro to epi course. The homework assignments can be long and tedious but worth it.",
    "This course will give you a broad overview of epidemiology and I would recommend it to a student.",
    "Required class and good foundational base",
    "Absolutely. You will learn a lot from this class. It isn't always easy, but that's not why we are here. We came to challenge ourselves and learn important, applicable information. And this course is it.",
    "A great overview of epidemiological concepts. You come away feeling like you learned a lot of very applicable ideas. It is a very fair course and well- taught.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course!",
    "Useful",

    "good course",
    "As a required course, I feel like recommending or not recommending it is not necessary. Personally, I really enjoyed the class! I felt empowered because this was one of the only classes that I had this semester where I felt like the material (particularly the reading material) was accessible, relevant, and appropriate in amount. The regular homework assignments also helped me stay on top of the material covered in lecture in an way that made preparing for the exams less stressful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend epi and it gave me a solid foundation for my future studies.",
    "Work-heavy but extremely interesting and rewarding class.",
    "Difficult, but helpful in understanding epidemiology and reading studies.",

    "Overall the class was useful and I learned a lot.",
    "A lot of homework, but teaches you the principles the epidemiology. I would recommend it because I now feel like I have learnt the fundamentals of this area of study.",
    "the course was a nice structured introductory course to epidemiology. It is not terribly difficult but it does require a lot of work.",
    "Epi takes a bit of time and effort so make sure you don't slack off or skip lectures! Professor Niccolai goes over her slides pretty well in class so it's beneficial to be present and engaged. I would recommend this class to other students as it's a fundamental element for our ever-growing MPH program knowledge base.",
    "very good",
    "Yes I would recommend this to any student hoping to better understand a fundamental \"pillar of public health.\" It is very well-organized and can be taken by anyone that has an interest in understanding disease frequency\/occurrence at the population level. It is a little more work than other courses but certainly all worth it--the work makes complete sense and helps to understand the material.",
    "The course is very useful and an necessary building block for any public health research you will want to do. You will find at the end of the semester that you know much more than you realize. The exams are ok but a little unfair sometimes. If you work hard, attend the Friday session, and study consistently, the class is easily managed.",
    "I thought it was a good course. I would recommend it.",
    "As a core requirement course, it would be what you expected in a \"core\" class. Good foundation knowledge of epidemiology.",
    "This course is required, but I think you learn a lot of important and applicable concepts that are important to public health in general. I feel more confident about reading about studies in papers, interpreting the results, and even designing a study which I had to do in other classes on exams\/in a final paper which I felt that I could draw on the things I learned in this class. You actually learn things that you will bring away from the course. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. You really learn the foundations of Epi! Great course! Great Instructor!",
    "Good introductory course for those who never took epidemiology before. It sets up the fundamentals for reading and understanding scientific articles.",
    "You will need it so take your time to understand the material and not just cram it in for tests.",
    "Good course, I was excited to learn epi because all of the TAs and especially Linda, are all so passionate about the subject! Leaving the course, I believe that I have a firm foundation of basic epi concepts to continue learning more",
    "Yes the skills learned from the course were helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I found myself applying concepts from it to all sorts of different situations, in different classes, etc. The material is foundational and immensely useful in a public health program. I realized that I do like epidemiology because of this class, and this course was part of the reason why I decided to switch into an epidemiology track within the MPH program.",
    "You will learn the foundations of epidemiology, covering basic methods to measure and analyze risk, how to design an evaluate an epidemiologic study, and how to maximize factors related to internal and external validity.",
    "This class was an extremely important introduction to epidemiology that provides an essential foundational knowledge for other public health courses. It also provides knowledge necessary to be a informed individual who is able to effectively assess mainstream media interpretation of scientific studies. It offered me a new framework through which to view public health studies.",
    "Dry, sometimes boring material, but fundamentally necessary for understanding other courses at YSPH.",
    "I would recommend this course as a basis for successful professional in public health",
    "Imperative to our MPH education, a lot of work, very detail oriented, and challenging tests.",
    "I think this was a course that all MPH students should take. It could be structured away from the emphasis on grades but the material was very useful and applicable to all of my other courses and the work I would like to do in the future.",
    "It's required (and for good reason), but your experience may depend on your TF\/section.",
    "Since this was a required course, I don't know if I would have any choice in recommending it. However, I definitely would, it was a great introduction to the major methods and techniques of epidemiological research, a core component of public health practice.",
    "Yes, this is a basic epidemiology course that is very useful. The lectures are straightforward and easy to understand. Not too much work required either.",
    "A lot of tests and information. You will learn alot but be sure to always be on top of the material. I would recommend this class as I think it's a good comprehensive intro course.",
    "The course requires a great deal of work, but you learn a lot over the course of the semester.",
    "I highly recommend this class for students entering into public health. I feel that I truly learned the concepts and that these fundamental concepts will be the basis for my public health career.",
    "Its a great introduction to epi. Try to get to know Dr. Niccolai, she is a great resource and puts a human touch to epi.",
    "The course lectures and slides are useful for understanding applications of epidemiology. However, the course lectures\/homework are not consistent with exam.",
    "Take it! You need it!",
    "A very good overview of all of the basic aspects of epidemiology. You will learn a lot and have a greater appreciation for all sorts of public health work and studies.",
    "Summary: This course gives an excellent introduction to epidemiology, study approaches, and analysis approaches. I would definitely recommend it to other students interested in public health because it taught me important concepts that I need to understand most public health articles.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to every student in the school of public health. It is an extremely useful course and a great introduction to epidemiology.",
    "Definitely recommend for basic understanding of epi. The homeworks and exams provide a lot of great pratice.",
    "Overall a very good course. I learned a lot and epidemiology as a practice and method really became clearer to me. As it is required, for those who are going to take the course, I would encourage them to make the most of the discussion times, to ask questions, and utilize office hours. I think you can get a lot out of the course if you put in the effort.",
    "This course is an introduction to epidemiology, ranging from study design to sources of bias to quantitative measures. It is very well-organized with a strong instructor. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course as it is the foundation for public health."
