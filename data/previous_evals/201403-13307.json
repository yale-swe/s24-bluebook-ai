    "A great lecture on a very important topic. I would recommend this class, and Professor Rugemer, to anyone at Yale.",
    "Yes!",
    "I cannot recommend this class enough. This was my first history class at Yale, and the only reason that I am considering taking more of them.",
    "amazing course. i learned a massive amount about slavery in the atlantic (and all of its cultures, not just within the U.S.). taking good notes is key to doing well in this class but prof R is a fantastic lecturer who really loves the subject. its a midterm and final which are all ID's (pretty easy but you need to put in the work to know them)",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's so interesting and important subject matter. Be warned though, the grading is hard and unclear, which can be very frustrating.",
    "Do you wonder how structural discrimination came to exist in America? Do you look at headlines about Ferguson and ask \"how did we get here?\" Do you feel like you skimmed over slavery in high school history class? Do you know about the Haitian Revolution? THE HAITIAN REVOLUTION IS SO IMPORTANT! Basically, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS COURSE! This course will show you that racial issues we face today are the brand of slavery that still burns us in the present. Professor Rugemer is an incredible lecturer and a really nice guy. He loves to talk to students and answer their questions. The syllabus is great. The lectures are great. This class is such a history department gem. I would not be surprised if it became one of the cannon \"you have to take it\" courses in the future. It will be up there with Cold War, and Civil War, and US Gay and Lesbian History.",
    "This is a solid lecture. Rugemer is an amazing storyteller and this is a class all Yale students should take.",
    "Take it - its content is interesting and important, but beware of hard tests.",
    "Absolutely great lectures. As a first semester senior, this was one of the first, if not the first, classes that I've ever wanted to get up at 930 to take. Rugemer really knows the material, and the course is well structured. That being said, the class is much more work than I had originally thought. There are weekly reflections on the weekly book assignment (not long). For the midterm the prof gives you a list of 130+ terms to memorize, 7 of which appear on the test - from which you can select 5 to write individual essays about. The final had the same structure, but with a few more terms, plus an additional 6 page take home essay. There is also a 12 page essay due at the end of the term. And if you're in the writing section, there are also some smaller 2 page papers. The class was great, just know that it'll be some work.",
    "Great course. Professor Rugemer is awesome and makes each lecture interesting. I sometimes wish I didn't have to take notes so that I could just sit back and enjoy the story. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in an incredibly important, but oftentimes only partially known, part of our history. Plus, Rugemer is the bomb.",
    "Rise and Fall is an excellent course. It is fun, engaging, and challenging without being overwhelming and you walk a way with a much fuller understanding of slavery in America and throughout the world. It provides a useful context to help understand where much of the world is today.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It has been my favorite so far at Yale. Atlantic Slavery is a very difficult topic to discuss, but I took this course because I thought it was important to get a better understanding of this time in history. Professor Rugemer taught me that it is an absolutely essential part of our history, and I would recommend this class to any person who is at all interested in history, American Studies, or why it is that our country is the way that it is now. Professor Rugemer made getting up for a 9:25 on Mondays and Wednesdays worth it. He gives out handouts at the beginning of each class with a list of terms, so that when you take notes you can focus on writing down things relating to these main ideas. These are the same identifications he quizzes you on during the Mid term and Final. There is a decent amount of reading (one book a week), as well as research paper and a final exam consisting of identifications and a take-home essay but its SUPER worth it. If you are at all interested, take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking a history class, or learning about the condition of Africans in the America",
    "This class is a great lecture. BUT! Sometimes the class doesn't seem to follow the syllabus. Information and instructions are vague (or not given) until assignments are already graded. Assignments that you would expect to be listed on the syllabus are not. Interesting class with great professor and great information but terrible organization.",
    "Great lecture on the history of Atlantic slavery. The material doesn't focus exclusively -- or even mostly -- on slavery in the American South, which was refreshing. Brazil, the British Caribbean, Haiti, African participation in the trade, etc., are all discussed. Rugemer knows his stuff and the reading list is pretty good, with emphasis on primary sources. Would recommend if you don't have much background in Atlantic slavery beyond the antebellum South and Civil War. Also, take it writing-intensive -- it's really not that much more work. Workload is reasonable: midterm, final, couple of short papers (3ish pages), 10-12 page term paper.",
    "This class really dives into how racialized slavery came to be in the Americas and how its end came about. It is a super important class to take in order to understand American\/south American history. It is extremely interesting and the workload is just enough that you really take away a lot from the class, but not so much that it is unmanageable. Would recommend!",
    "A really fantastic course--my favorite at Yale so far. Professor Rugemer was a phenomenal lecturer, as evidenced by the way in which the entire class hung on his every word. The readings were always captivating, even if their connection to specific lectures weren't always clear. This class really was transformative for me in the way in which it opened my eyes to an entire era of history I previously thought I understood. My perspective on the world we live on today has changed tremendously since taking this class. M"
