    "Believe the past evaluations-- this class will absorb every free minute. That said, it's a great chance to hone your writing skills and do some first-hand reporting.",
    "If you are willing to put in the time and effort to report stories (conduct interviews, tour labs or field sites, etc.) and craft&revise articles, you will gain a lot from this course. It's very cool to have a seminar with Carl Zimmer.",
    "This class is, at its heart, a journalism class -- which is why I find it so surprising that most of the students in the class are science majors. Zimmer's \"Writing About Science\" should be part of the canon of must-take classes for aspiring journalists at Yale, right up there with courses taught by Anne Fadiman and Fred Strebeigh. It's excellent. And it's also interesting -- you quickly discover that science reporters are covering some of the most fun, interesting and quirky stories around. No class at Yale got me so excited and psyched about writing and the future of journalism as this one did.Be warned: Prof. Zimmer is a very, verytough grader. There were times when I spent half a day re-working my paper for my second draft, only to get my article returned with the exact same grade as my first draft. But he's tough for a reason -- he makes you tough on yourself, and it makes you better. I did the worst in EVST215 out of all of my classes this semester ... but it was my favorite class, and the class from which I learned the most.",
    "There's a paper or a draft due every week. This isn't a course in which you can easily get an A or an A-, so if you don't want a B+\/-, you should take this credit\/D\/Fail. In the course, we read drafts of each other's work and it's odd to see how the professor and class criticizes a paper that most people would consider rather good."
