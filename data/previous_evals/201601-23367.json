    "I wish Amity had participated more in class, instead of relying so much on student presentations. Three hours is a long time for students to lead a class that they don't have much background on and I would have gotten more our of the course material if Amity had also lectured.",

    "Everyone should be required to take this course.",
    "Question 1 - I was actually a little disappointed in the readings. Some of them were great but I think there are others out there that would have been more instrumental to our learning in the class and would have given way to even deeper discussion.",
    "Question 1: I thought that the readings came from a very diverse set of scholars, activists, and writers and exposed the class to a wide range of perspectives. Question 12: I felt that the course was valuable but given that the course is discussion-focused, it can be limited by the discussion participants level of knowledge and engagement with the material. I felt that sometimes the course would have benefited from more students that are very involved in EJ issues on a day-to-day basis, or bringing in guest speakers\/discussion facilitators that could take the discussions to the next level."

    "The readings. Particularly those by Pulido and Taylor. I also liked the discussions and the relatively non-competitive nature of the course.",
    "I like that this course shone a light on EJ issues, which aren't covered in other classes at FES.",
    "This class taught subject material that is not usually taught within the environmental studies curriculum. I found it extremely important information to know as an EVST major, and I know many of the FES students felt the same way. The course was entirely student led with occasional lectures given by Amity. I enjoyed this format! Overall the class got very close and we explored a lot of difficult questions together.",
    "I really appreciated the open discussion space. The readings were interesting and Adrien was an excellent teaching assistant. EJ as a subject should be required for all in this field (see below). I felt like I came in with a lot of exposure to social justice issues, but it was great to get a better sense for the environmental justice perspective. It was also really helpful to get a more structured framework for discussing these ideas. Also, the opportunity to work for the NAACP was really exciting.",
    "The topic itself is one that is rarely offered at FES, and I really appreciated the opportunity to learn about environmental injustice in the US. The instructor and TA were both great, and it was a very good bunch of classmates. Discussions, therefore, we're usually very fruitful and thought-provoking.",
    "Theme of readings each week was great and creates space for discussion of a unique topic at F&ES.",
    "The readings were well chosen to cover many different aspects of the issue from multiple lenses--history, present, domestic vs. international.",
    "Readings were fantastic",
    "The safe setting to dissect critical and \"touchy\" subjects.",
    "Class discussions were extremely valuable. I felt like I had a free and open space to express my thoughts and perspectives.",
    "Discussion was fantastic. It was very valuable to be able to sit with peers and discuss these tough issues.",
    "Amity definitely picked a lot of great readings to guide the course and it was incredibly cathartic to every week to discuss the important values, themes, and histories that have made the EJ movemnt what it is today. Also, the symposium and creation of posters was a fantastic way to disseminate lessons learned to the FES community. Please keep that going in the future!",
    "I thought that the open-ended discussions during class offered a great opportunity to hear what fellow students thought about the material. Rarely are issues like EJ brought up in other classes at FES, so this was a refreshing change of pace to be surrounded by people who similarly were passionate about the material. I felt that Amity and Adrien did a good job of encouraging further discussion of salient points."

   "comments": [
    "FES needs more environmental justice courses desperately. This course could easily be split into four or more: History of Environmental Justice in the United States Legacies of Colonialism in Conservation History International Environmental Justice Issues Climate Justice and Adaptation Every year FES loses admitted domestic students of color to Michigan SNRE largely due to weakness in the environmental justice field, which I know from talking to admitted students both in my year and in the entering class next year. Because FES has a greater wealth of financial and other resources than SNRE, I think even a small improvement in environmental justice offerings and better treatment of environmental justice faculty here would result in measurable improvement in the percentage of domestic students of color who matriculate. I also believe that Dr. Doolittle should be given a tenure-track faculty position and that more environmental justice faculty need to be hired to stand alongside her. FES has a serious problem in hiring and granting tenure to women, which is in itself a major environmental justice issue.",
    "Updated reading materials and more solution-oriented approaches. More lectures and input from Amity.",
    "Sometimes some readings overlooked, maybe we could assign presenters to talk about specific readings and propose reading-specific questions? I also would have loved to have more books as opposed to journal articles, but I found the articles interesting as well!",
    "I really wish Amity had lectured more. I think a lot of people were in the class because of her, and it was disappointing that she was not more involved in a teaching role. I appreciated the bottom up value of the course, but I still would have liked to have heard from someone with more expertise. Also, three hours is a long time for conversation. There is definitely a lot to say, but I think it could have been split into one hour of lecture and two hours of discussion, or something similar.",
    "it would have been great to learn about environmental injustices in a more global setting as opposed to mainly focusing on the US, where environmental injustice has a very racial focus.",
    "Student-facilitated discussions sometimes were not as focused on the readings, and each student should have read what the others posted on the forum to get a better sense of what the entire class was thinking about, so there would be a greater common ground for discussion to take place effectively.",
    "I really valued the power points presentation you provided many weeks explaining the key points from the prior week. Also, I think some of the subject matter could use some updating as far as the reading goes. Find more recent articles to compliment the outdated, but critical articles.",
    "More feedback throughout the course on our writing assignments and class facilitation roles would have been appreciated.",
    "As mentioned, I think the reading selection could be improved upon. There may also be a different way to organize the readings week to week that would be more useful.",
    "I would love to see Amity insert herself more in discussions although I also understand why she lets the students take charge of the conversation. I was very glad to see her lecture on a lot of important parts of the course since having that background really helped me take more away from the readings and our discussion, it was a good foundation to have.",
    "I felt that the discussion questions posed online and the reading responses in general could be integrated better into the discussion session. Although some discussion facilitators made a strong effort to integrate such things into the course agenda for the day, this was not always the case. Sometimes Amity asked students to expand upon their responses if the topic charted closely to what they had written, but other times the reading responses were not readily acknowledged."

   "comments": [
    "I wanted more lectures and less discussion, truth be told. I'm not sure we students knew all that much. The pool of students is drawn from the diversity (or lack thereof) in FES pool, which informs (and limits) the perspectives that then enter the discussion. I'd also like a clearer idea of the standards for grading and more feedback on, for example, discussion performance (we never actually saw our grades for discussion participation). The professor offered a detailed rubric at the beginning of the course, but I got the sense that a lot of the grading itself was based on how much the professor thought we cared about the course. I'm not sure how to make the grading less subjective, but that style of relational evaluation makes me very nervous about bias.",
    "NA",
    "yes it was great that the blog posts weren't ignored. the discussants picked up on them, and instructor referred to them.",
    "The relationship was largely effective, since there was only one session per week, the lectures were followed by discussion immediately. Lectures clarified and emphasized important concepts and facts to set up the discussion that would springboard from the lectures.",
    "I was glad that Amity did a lecture on certain aspects that required background information i.e. the history of housing discrimination in New Haven. It was not necessary for all classes but I think it was helpful for some."

   "comments": [
    "The course fit into my Master of Environmental Management (MEM) part of my joint degree, and it was interesting to take the course concurrently as an elective while I was still taking core courses at the School of Management. Learning environmental justice perspectives and understanding more about incidents of environmental injustice was useful, and so was learning more about businesses and business decisions from SOM at the same time.",
    "What I learned will definitely inform my future work. The course has already challenged a lot of my prior assumptions about, for example, race and ethnicity, and has introduced me to injustices I previously did not know existed (e.g., the U.S.'s flouting of the Basel Ban in the export of e-waste).",
    "While my interests are not specifically geared toward EJ, I think EJ is a key tenant of all work in the environmental sector. This movement cannot move forward without the driving ethics of justice, and FES as a school should be focusing more in this direction. Also, taking this course in tangent with a more econ-focused course was really great. I think the values and insights from each challenge the other, and I think that EJ was generally a really helpful way to temper and contest some of the basic \"truths\" presented by econ. Meanwhile, econ (specifically cost-benefit analysis) provides a tool for decision making. I think my main take-away was that all econ and quantifiable \"truths\" need context that comes not from experts but from the community being addressed. EJ provides a framework for explaining the context and pointing out where the general models put forth by econ are insufficient or unjust.",
    "It is a unique course not offered at the undergraduate EVST level and something that I am personally interested in.",
    "This course fits into anyone's overall program at FES.",
    "This course is invaluable for those hoping to gain more understanding about social injustices, especially in the environmental field. F&ES needs more courses like this. Environmental leaders should have at least some recognition of the full history of environmentalism and conservation and should have an awareness about how social injustices intermingle with environmental issues.",
    "EJ issues are ever present in all the disciplines FES students study and I really wish the school could offer more classes within this area of interest. As a professional school, we are a pipeline for sending future graduates into the environmental field to solve its many problems. With the Yale name, we carry so much privilege and prestige and I wish we could use that for more good: educate students that would not be typically exposed to these issues of injustice within our communities and to motivate them to care and take action. I have been motivated to address social equity in my future work and at FES, my goal was to take courses that would allow me to advance my knowledge and thinking in this area. I want to be able to address things like structural racism but without allies the task is not achievable. If we offered more classes like this at FES, we can reach a larger amount of students to be cognizant of what has happened in the past and continues to be perpetuated today in our society. I am really glad I got to take this course but I wish many others could have the opportunity to do so as well."

It will force you to question your own places of privilege that you may come from, and you will likely ask yourself about the values that guide your everyday decision making and how those values may or may not have contributed to some of the injustices you will discuss in this course.
