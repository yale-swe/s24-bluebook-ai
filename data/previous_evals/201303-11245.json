    "First semester DS H&P is alright. The readings can be kind of dense, but when they're good, they're REALLY good. As for professors, Petranovich was decent. Don't go out of your way to get him, but also don't freak out if you're assigned his section.",
    "You have to take it if you're doing DS, but it was my least favorite of the three courses.",
    "It's a good course because it helped me see history and politics in a way I had never seen it before, I recommend it",
    "The readings are very interesting although sometimes they feel rather sporadic and arbitrary. Depending on what section you are in discussions can be more or less interesting or related but either way you honestly learn so much. Even just the thinking process and writing the papers is such a learning curve.",
    "Take it. It's pretty interesting and it means you get to take the other two classes.",
    "Yes! I would certainly recommend DS to another student. The H and P section is considered by some to be the driest of material, but I found it to be plenty stimulating. It is a study of history\/political writings from Herodotus to Christian theologians. It covers Greek, Roman, and Christian civilizations. Do NOT take this as the typical historical course, for dates and people are not as important. They certainly play a role, but nothing like any previous history course that I have had.",
    "I'd recommend it because if you're in DS you have to take it, but this is probably the weakest link of the tripartite DS curriculum.",
    "I would recommend DS H&P, though potential DS'ers should keep in mind that they will be analyzing historical and political thought, rather than pure history\/politics. There was considerable reading, as one might expect from a DS course, but it was certainly manageable."
