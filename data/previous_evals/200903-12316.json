   "comments": [
    "Take it! This class is so interesting and you will learn so much, and think critically and explore these texts thoughtful. The professors are fantastic and the texts are fascinating.",
    "I though that this was a great overview of classic Asian literature, with a general emphasis on how it relates to religious life and understanding. Although the material is sometimes difficult, the professor make it understandable and quite intriguing. I would definitely recommend this class, especially because of the two professors.",
    "Take it! Eastern studies (for the lack of a better term) at Yale don't seem to have the \"survey\" classes that other departments. It was a great class -- small -- inspiring readings. There was quite a bit of reading but you were motivated to finish them because they were so provoking.",
    "The course was a stimulating introduction to Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. It got me deeply interested in the possibility of Religious Studies as a concentration, something I had never considered.",
    "If you are interested in the material you will enjoy the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with some interest in literature, especially more classical lit. This wasn't an area with which I was familiar or particularly interested at first, but I soon grew to appreciate and enjoy the works that we read. I loved that this was a broad overview of all three cultures since I wanted to learn about all of them without devoting a whole semester to each. The class format was excellent--minimal writing and a strong focus on low-key, in-class discussion meant that we could appreciate the themes and subtleties of the works without stressing about finishing papers and preparing for tests. As a freshman, I was also very grateful for the opportunity to get to know so many interesting upperclassmen in a smaller setting. I'll admit that the Chinese philosophy still confuses me, but both professors were excellent and extremely knowledgeable, and I never had any qualms about approaching them for more information. Their teaching styles are very different in terms of how they lead discussions and respond to the short weekly writing prompts, but I thought the result was good. The midterm and final papers are very manageable, only 5-7 pages. I did enjoy the random pictorial slide shows and the video clips of Kathak dance and kabuki theater. Overall a very satisfactory class, especially since it was not high pressure and felt like a real learning environment.",
    "This is a good class. You get to read classic texts of three very different and important countries. It's a cool way to learn about these countries, cultures and religions. The work load was kind of a lot at times but worthwhile. Sometimes you will feel a little lost in the text and this class is not comprehensive but you will still get to see important glimpses of these cultures.",
    "A whirlwind tour of traditional literature in Asia. I think its great because it gives you a flavor for several different countries in one class. You do sacrifice depth for breadth though.",
    "HUMS 418 follows a pretty standard seminar format. Readings are discussed in class, and a reading response is due every week. I would certainly recommend this course if you have even a slight interest in the material. Profs. Granoff and Shinohara are two of the best at Yale, and their passion for the material is infectious. The readings can get a bit hefty but are always manageable. The written assignments are very short (1-2 pg.\/week; 5-7pg. midterm\/final).",
    "Great course, gave me good foundation to different traditions that I hadn't been familiar with, and Koichi and Phyllis are both great teachers and caring people. I wouldn't have minded a little more background reading as part of the class-the \"Foundations of Buddhism\" piece was very helpful, and something similar for Hinduism might have been helpful. Other than that small suggestion, however, this was a great course.",
    "A wonderful seminar course which attracts an eclectic bunch of students (we had everything from freshmen to grad students in the course in 2009). The syllabus focuses on literature important to the formation of various Eastern religious and cultural traditions, so you read works from early in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism (and its various divisions), Confucianism, Daoism, and the Japanese court tradition. I took the course in order to learn the basics of some different philosophical and religious perspectives and outlooks on the world, and I was very happy with what I learned. As a bonus, a number of the readings are also quite entertaining.The course is divided: the first half of the semester is on India and taught by Prof. Granoff, whose leading of seminar discussions was particularly good and helpful. The second half focuses on China and Japan and is taught by Prof. Shinohara, who is also good. (The two are a husband-and-wife team.) The workload is very manageable: a 1-2 page reading response every week (no grades, only comments), and two 5-7 page papers. The reading responses are good for getting you to think through some aspect of what you have been reading (which, if you are like me and are steeped only in the Western tradition, often contains a multitude of strange and thought-provoking concepts). Overall, a highly recommended course.",
    "I would most definitely take the class- it was a hidden treasure trove.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It was a wonderful whirlwind tour through the classical literature of three major and ancient civilizations. Rather than shallowly touching on everything, we tended to grab onto and explore specific themes, depending on what the class wanted to discuss. It attracted a variety of people, so there were always people coming to the readings for the first time, along with those with a bit more knowledge. Both Professor Granoff and Professor Shinohara are wonderful, and though the reading load was heavy, the workload wasn't bad at all."
