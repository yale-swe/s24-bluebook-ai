    "It's loosely constructed but that's part of the appeal. Take it as a survey. Sometimes it feels uneasy how diverse and different from each other the topics can be.",
    "Recommended.",
    "A little unfocused. Take it if you are highly motivated to read philosophical texts about architecture.",
    "Yes, I would take it. But be cautioned, this course is definitely only what you make of it.",
    "If you are interested in what makes architecture sacred you will really enjoy this class. It is not very much work but if you have good students in the class the discussions can become very interesting.",
    "Whether you're interested in religion or architecture, this class will make you approach it in a new way and is well worth taking. You definitely don't need to be an architecture\/religion major, either.",
    "This was a wonderful course. The arc of the subject matter worked really well; we began with theoretical readings and transitioned into student presentations. The small size (it'll probably be capped at 12) fostered a great seminar atmosphere. There was a nice blend of undergrads, architecture grad students, and Div School. Professer Britton was wonderful. She has a knack for asking the right questions and making the right probing comments to transition the conversation into new and more interesting territory. She is a great seminar leader. And her interest is contagious. Try to get in, and take it!"
