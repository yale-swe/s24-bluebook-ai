   "comments": [
    "Long. Painful. Good feeling to hand in your essay.",
    "The senior essay was a challenging exercise in research, analysis, and formal academic writing.",
    "I would highly recommend PLSC 480: allows for independent, self-guided exploration on a subject of your choice.",
    "I recommend it because it doesn't box you into the subject of a single seminar. You can explore various issues that interest you.",
    "A terrific opportunity to get one-on-one guidance on your essay. Would help if you begin research design at the end of junior year and research during the summer before senior year, however.",
    "Yes.",
    "Plan out your time and get an adviser you work well with",
    "Yes. It was a great class.",
    "I would not recommend doing a senior essay independently, if you can help it. Try to figure out which advisors are helpful and pick the nicest one you can find. START EARLY, just pick a topic and run with it. You will be proud of yourself in the end, but the process might be stressful if you're not good at getting stuff done without clear deadlines. Also, write your senior essay in the fall. JUST DO IT.",
    "It was hard in the beginning to work on my senior thesis during midterm season. It is important to stay focused."
