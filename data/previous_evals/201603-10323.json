   "comments": [
    "I became much more familiar with the body of work that constitutes trans studies, and in particular with a lot of work having to do with various intersections of gender, sexuality, and race. I think I also developed my skills in doing research for a paper.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of trans studies, though it feels like less about current trans studies? Just an impression. Have read much more theory than I had before, so probably more comfortable with that than I was.",
    "This class was an excellent introduction to trans studies, but it also provided me with a really comprehensive vocabulary of foundational gender\/queer\/trans studies terms and concepts. Professor LaFleur was really good at making dense theory accessible, and taught how to see connections between texts and put pieces in conversation with one another.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the central subject, gender and trans studies, that I knew absolutely nothing about before. I appreciated that the course focused on theory and academic analysis in the subject area, such that future media\/culture studies will be more informed. Because of the sensitive and personal nature of the subject material, I feel like I'm better equipped to explain and support gender justice issues in my future life. I also improved slightly with presenting, and learned more about myself as a public speaker. Lastly, I learned that, sometimes, the best thing is just to listen, to not even think about what I'm going to say next but rather to actively listen to people who know much more than I do.",
    "It was an introductory trans studies class, which I've never taken before, so EVERYTHING I suppose. The \"Cyborg Manifesto\" I liked in particular--this class is what got me thinking about posthumanism which has been really interesting, and new ways to think about the body, and the ways trans is at times in conflict with homosexuality, I really liked the Valentine reading about how intersectional analysis can sometimes reinscribe those categories, Dean Spade was amazing as always, I also really liked the Singer reading about the stakes involved in representation, photography in particular, and so on. I think one important thing is that this class brought the body back, when it feels that at times ideas about gender as a social construction or performativity can erase the body and don't really analyze it, also often fails to go far enough and really destabilize gender as they often claim to do. This class has been amazing!! I don't think I can stress that enough. I think it has so to speak given me a whole another lens through which to analyze the issue I'm interested in, I genuinely feel that it's given me a whole new set of tools.",
    "This course confirmed the pervasiveness of structural constraints that hinder trans self-determination in pernicious ways. Through engagement with a variety of textstracing the history of transgender as a category (and attempts to silence its expression throughout), documenting the tenuous relationship between the trans rights and women's rights movements, engaging with international expressions of gender variance, etc.the course provides a wide-ranging but sensitive foray into the question of gender and transgender history, rights and identity in the United States and (to a lesser degree) worldwide.",
    "I learned a lot of the landscape of trans studies, as well as its intersections with feminisms, queer studies, and other social movements. We thought a lot about gender and transgender identities, but also, because trans studies is pretty reflexive, we thought about what trans studies means, who it serves, how it's done, and how it should be done. I felt like I gained more in the latter regard, since most of what we read was reflexive.",
    "I gained an enormous amount of information not only about trans people and trans lives, but I also learned a great deal about the history of trans studies, how it relates to queer studies, feminist thought, critical race theory, prison reform, and anti-colonialism. This was my first WGSS course, and while I often felt over my head, I definitely learned a lot about how these issues can and do intersect. I didnt know so much about trans issues before I took this course. I benefited by gaining an enormous amount of knowledge about what the lives of different trans people look like and what the study of trans issues look like. I also gained some skills in reading theory. There was not as much formal instruction about how to approach these texts as there was pure exposure, but it was still a useful skill to build up."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it's carving out space for a new field of study within the WGSS curriculum. There are very, very few classes offered that deal specifically with transgender experience, and so this class fulfills a need for the university. It's set up much like an intro course, which is important for people who might not have studied trans experience before. It allows people who might not have had much experience dealing with trans literature before taking the class the opportunity to access a whole lot of transfeminist theory and history. The presentations were also great for getting us to think critically about a particular part of the course we might have been invested in. It also allowed us all to kind of get a picture of what each of our investments in the material were, which was often helpful when centering each other's arguments in the classroom. The thing is though, with seminars, you never really know what students are going to want to talk about during the hour and a half you're meeting with them. So, with that being said, we rarely made it through all of the assigned readings every week. That's the only weakness I might point out in the curriculum. It seemed we were always trying to tackle a little bit too much. However, since the course is formatted and marketed as an intro course to trans studies, having a great amount of literature available for students to wade through might in fact be helpful for those just trying to figure out what they want to study in the field.",
    "I loved the readings in this course, which were both interesting and manageable. Also, Professor LaFleur is awesome. It bothered me to some degree that Professor LaFleur calls on students in the order in which they raise their hands, which to me made it somewhat more difficult to speak, or for what I said to be relevant, since frequently I would raise my hand hoping to respond to a specific point someone else had made and end up in the \"cue\" waiting to speak. By the time she got to me, my point would no longer be relevant.",
    "Strengths: engaged and interested students; active discussion (at least, in the early\/mid portion of the semester, before people in all classes inevitably sort of get tired and have trouble keeping up); Greta was also a wonderful professor, so knowledgable and always willing to help us out when we were confused or struggling. Weaknesses: sometimes it felt like the discussion was less student-to-student and more student-to-professor-back-to-student, which I understand happens when students are less engaged and the conversation requires more management, but still could be frustrating. Also - it was hard only having one major assignment at the end of the semester because it was hard to space out work and I had a less solid idea of how I was doing. Also, some students didn't really do the reading and just relied on pre-existing knowledge, so maybe some kind of regular check-in (like the small group discussions we had on the last day) to ensure that people are doing the reading and taking responsibility for it. Improvements: more \"small-group\" discussions, like we had on the last day of class, they're great!",
    "I do feel that the class was just a little too big, although I also felt that this class discussion was the best I've had this term. Although everyone was coming from different backgrounds, we all jived really well with each other which was awesome. However I did feel like we often never got to most of the readings which was too bad cause they were all very interesting. I also really liked the amount of theory in this course--I feel like it gave me a solid background\/analytical tools to think about the questions in this course. I also liked the student presentations, although I feel like a lot of the students didn't really bring something new--I feel like they often stuck to the texts we were assigned.",
    "In general I found the course to be incredibly engaging and relatively innovative (within the constraints of the seminar method that Yale imposes on its professors). The course is strong in its ability to balance breadth and nuance, and encourages students to question the salience of transgender as a category through comparison with other cultural and historical contexts. Two minor weaknesses I can identify (and they're a stretch) are that: (1) some readings are kind of overkill in driving home the same message that we've reached before, though I think that has to do with the pool of trans studies writings available rather than Greta's curation skills (2) I wish we would discuss in greater depth the films we viewed; I felt they were more of an appendix to the course rather than a complementary component.",
    "Awesome readings! Great professor and super smart\/engaged students who are interesting to have discussions with! I like that we all got to do presentations, and that the workload was reasonable.",
    "There was a lot of weight grade-wise placed on the annotated bibliography, and no grade incentive to participate. While I understand that the lack of graded participation was meant accommodate those uncomfortable with such participation, but perhaps graded participation could be opt-in, so the whole grade of the class wouldn't be determined by three assignments.",
    "This course has a fantastic selection of readings and movies. One of the major things I got out of this course was just pure exposure to an area of which I previously had little to know knowledge. Not only did the variety of readings provide me with a vast amount of knowledge on different aspects of trans issues, but they also exposed me to new ways of thinking about issues like trans issues in general. Some of the more philosophically oriented pieces were not only relevant to trans issues and lives (though they largely focused on them) but also spoke to what gender and self identity mean in general. I also enjoyed doing the presentation on one of the weeks readings. The assignment was a good way for different students to introduce and uniquely engage with the readings. I also enjoyed doing research for and writing the final paper. I gained a fair amount of knowledge and context during the discussions. Greta would generally provide necessary context, both historical and conceptual. While I did say that the readings were one of the main strengths of this course, they were also one of the weaknesses. Because there was so much and usually rather dense readings, it was difficult to go into reasonable depth into many of them during the discussion. The discussion would go one of two ways. Either we would talk almost exclusively about one piece or we would talk superficially about various pieces. Due to the vast amount of material that we were reading each week, the conversations would tend to veer towards the more general, non-text related topics. It was difficult to refer to specific moments in the text because the conversations often began and\/or ended up in places that I was not thinking about while reading and because there were so many texts each week. So a good amount of the time we ended up talking vaguely about some of the ideas the text raised up but more about other, related issues. This was frustrating for me because I didnt have much expertise in the area, so I couldnt fall back on this. Also, I wanted to really engage with the texts themselves as they had a lot in them. I really liked the readings and would have liked to understand them more than I did. I see a couple of ways of remedying this problem. 1) Have students write up responses to the readings. For one seminar I took in the past and in many sections, our instructors had us write either questions we had of the text or a summary and analysis of the texts. I think this might help to both engage the students more in the texts and to focus the discussion. The responses would be do a day or so before class so that the instructor could review the responses and structure the discussion accordingly. 2) Give the students specific questions\/areas to think about while reading the text. Just because the texts are so dense and the conversation can go in so many directions, it might be useful to suggest some things to think about while reading the texts. This could help to remedy the problem I had of not having much to say during class because I didnt think about the text in the way the discussion went. 3) Assign fewer texts, or make it clear which texts are the primary focus for each week. 4) More strongly encourage students to keep discussions within\/directly tied to the text."

   "comments": [
    "Trans\/gender studies is an important thing for people to learn, understand, and\/or grapple with. This course truly allows for people to learn about the complex dynamics of gender and power at work in society. It invites those both of trans experience and without trans experience to the table to discuss how gender is a nuanced historical phenomenon. I think anyone could take this class and leave it with a more complex and nuanced understanding of what gender and transgender are\/have been in the world.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to learn a lot about trans theory through reading. There is a lot of reading but not that much work otherwise, and Professor LaFleur is really great and very good at what she does.",
    "I would advise that the course is heavily, heavily theory-based. There's not much opportunity to talk about lived experience, particularly your own, or how the theory actually relates to lived experience, and I think opportunities for those discussions would strengthen the course. Probably a good class for well-meaning cis people.",
    "This course is very good. You should take it.",
    "Definitely take this course! There's a steep learning curve if you've never been exposed to gender studies and its associated terminology and concepts. However, Greta is an amazing professor and is so knowledgable and willing to help you out if you're struggling. It may seem like a niche subject, but honestly, trans studies has changed not only how I think about gender, but how I think about social systems and constructs in general. To be honest, I think everyone should take a trans studies course!",
    "This course has been very transformative for me, academically and personally. I remember I walked into the first day of class thinking something like 'wow, this class is full of freaks.' Although I already knew then how much of an asshole I am to think that way, I think it requires effort and education to get rid of the subconscious prejudices you grew up with. So this class has been very important for me not only in expanding my understanding of gender but also helping me shed the prejudices and stereotypes that fogged my worldview. The readings are very well chosen. Although this is a class registered under AMST, the readings give some transnational perspective, which is something I found really nice about the syllabus. The only complaint that I have about the syllabus is that there are often 3-5 readings assigned for one class, making it difficult to discuss the readings in-depth and the discussions rushed and stressful. I think it would have been nicer to assign 3-5 readings per class but let students know in advance 1 or 2 that will be discussed during class. This is a wonderful class not just to learn about transgender studies but also to think more deeply about about gender studies, feminism, histories of oppression, etc.",
    "Yes for all the reasons above and also because prof. Lafleur is amazing!!!",
    "Highly. If you're looking for a course that has thought-provoking readings and discussions; engages with an under-recognized academic field (and identity); and pushes you to reconsider your understanding of gender and transgender in the United States, this is for you. I would even recommend this course for those who have never taken a WGSS course before and wish to understand trans experiences in America to a greater extent.",
    "Yes! Super interesting topic that you get to explore through a wide variety of lenses. Great for everyone from the novice to the experienced expert!",
    "This class is a great introduction to a field of study. You talk about gender and trans identities a lot, but even more than that you talk about how people talk about gender and transgender issuestrans studies is a particularly reflexive field of study, so there's a lot of tensions within it around how it should be done and what it should try to do. You come away from the class with a good sense of these disagreements, if not the answers to them. Professor LaFleur is super smart. She can sometimes go on long impromptu spur-of-the-moment lectures, but because she's so smart, I didn't mind.",
    "I would recommend this course because it opened up my perspective on issues I havent really thought much about or known much about. This was my first WGSS class and my first time seriously engaging with trans issues and many of the topics that intersect with it. The readings were often challenging and engaging. They were very different readings than what I was used to in other classes. Greta explained a lot of key concepts that serve as foundations to different areas of thought in trans studies. I also benefited enormously from the perspectives of the other students in the class, most of whom had thought much more seriously about these issues and who had much more personal experience dealing with some of these issues themselves. If you, like me, dont have much experience in these areas of study\/life, I would recommend the course. However, it will be difficult. I definitely felt out of my depth a good amount of the time. Its possible that someone with more expertise in the field would get more out of the class, so if youre planning on taking multiple WGSS classes then you might want to build up your knowledge base before taking this class. However, if youre interested in exploring a new field, youll definitely get a lot out of it!",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It's a great overview of trans studies, and if you're at all curious about trans issues at all this class is perfect for that. I loved all of the reading and the assignments make you engage critically with all of the foundational stuff you get in class."
