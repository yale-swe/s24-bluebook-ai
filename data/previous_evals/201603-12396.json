    "The range of material covered was really impressive! There was such a wonderful variety and, given the diversity regionally and thematically, the professor managed to pull together particular themes in a very productive manner. I feel like I gained a lot of knowledge re regional lit that I previously did not have. I would have liked to have more time to discuss the material and some more background and theoretical framing in the case of some texts; however, the timetable for the course was largely guilty - 1 hour and 15 minutes just is not enough time for lecture and discussion (especially as relates to some the of complex works we covered). It might have been better to have one three hour session a week that covered 2 films. The next week might be the literary works etc. This format might give more opportunity to delve into the works. Overall, the course was great and the students seemed to be really engaged and actively participated: the material was very stimulating and conducive to developing new ways of thinking and adopting multiple perspectives."
