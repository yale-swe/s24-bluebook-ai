   "comments": [
    "Many times during the semester, English 120 was a way for me to journal my thoughts. I grew more comfortable with my opinions on the world and loved sharing them through creative writing.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to any student who is at all interested in writing at Yale. Although there is typically a draft of an essay due every week, the workload is fairly manageable and the associated readings are really helpful in terms of allowing you to find your own voice. The classroom environment is really supportive and so there is no reason to worry if you feel like you aren't the best writer.",
    "YES! Perfect for a writing credit (for some people in my class this was their first non-STEM course), or if you're really interested in writing. DO IT!",
    "GREAT course! Whether or not you are an english writer, all Yale college students should take a course like this- it is fun, exciting, and intriguing.",
    "I enjoyed writing the essays for the course. The topics are very interesting, and fun, to write about. The actual class though seemed a but pointless. I didn't really get much as a writer out of the day to day activities of the course.",
    "Basically it's a great class for anyone looking for an introduction for different forms of creative non-fiction, with breadth (as opposed to depth) being the main focus.",
    "Great class to take! As an engineering major I wasn't expecting to get much out of the class but I actually feel like my writing improved and I enjoyed the reading\/writing that we did.",
    "Great, really fun class.",
    "YES! Take it! A note about grading: you get an A if you are PUBLISHABLE. which is great, I think. Forget about your grade for this class and just enjoy it. Let yourself write and open yourself up, and you will really get better. Don't try to quantify things - guide yourself with feeling. The more you go for that, the better you will get.",
    "English 120 helps to teach you how to write a modern non-fiction essay (think New Yorker, newspaper op-eds, humor pieces, etc). I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in improving their writing in this field. The thought of writing 5 essays over the semester can seem daunting, but the format of turning in a rough draft and then having a week to revise it makes it much more doable. I think this class is also a great way of introducing students to publication opportunities on campus and beyond."
