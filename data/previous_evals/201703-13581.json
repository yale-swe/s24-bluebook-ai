Most of the world and the country agree that this decision by the Administration is of great peril and folly. The skills I honed and developed were primarily in data analysis and writing, and I gained insights pertaining to the above subject matter."

    "The strength is in the Professor Josh Galperin, as well as Dave Hawkins and the other instructors, and the format of the class. The clinic class leads to a format whereby students get to craft their own experience largely through working with a group and client. This is both a cause of strength and weakness at times. I would've liked to have spent more time in class learning from the many guest speakers, but that was not a requirement for the Advanced version of the class, and for that I am a bit less enriched than I would've liked to have been."
