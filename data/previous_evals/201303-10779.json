    "Chinese 130 is a really good class and you will definitely learn a lot. The class follows a pretty simple pattern which makes it easy to get used to the high work load. If you are looking for and easy class, this isn't it, but if you are looking for an interesting and fun class this is one for you.",
    "Excellent. Work intensive but you learn so much.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I think that Chinese is a fantastic language to study.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, although I would say that it requires rigorous discipline and daily study.",
    "If I had to choose one class I thought I had learned the most in, it would be Chinese. Having the class 5 days a week, and a tutor session once a week--I felt like I learned so much more in one semester thanI had in a year's worth of high school Chinese.",
    "Chinese 130 is a very intensive course, but you also learn a ton. If you enjoyed Chinese 110\/120 and are willing to put in the work, Chinese 130 is a great course.",
    "Lots of students decide to bomb the placement exam and take this instead of L5, so you'll be dealing with a lot of freshmen with 3, 4, 5 years of experience in the language. Take advantage of the teacher's advice and do all the suggested work and use the suggested resources!"
