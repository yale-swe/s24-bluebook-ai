    "Absolute must take class. Easy and enjoyable, I actually enjoyed doing the work.",
    "If you get into this class TAKE IT! The perfect second semester senior course. Not too much work at all, but you get to learn about some very interesting trials and think about different aspects of the legal system. Professor Ford is an incredibly engaging professor and class discussion is usually interesting (although can get a bit repetitive at times). You also are fine only doing one reading or watching the video each week, so the workload is manageable. Overall, you will get a lot out of this class without having to stress to much about it!",
    "This is a fantastic class. The material is interesting, relevant, and easily accessible, and the discussions are relaxed and interesting. Absolutely take the class if you get in.",
    "Not much work - just a few videos and short readings every week to prepare for seminar discussions, plus a straightforward midterm and a final paper. Definitely an \"only at Yale\" kind of course!",
    "Absolutely! It is one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Jack Ford is a legend. Forget his accolades in the professional world - he is the most down to earth celebrity ever. And the best part is that he likes us and believes in us. Take this class just to absorb this man's wisdom. You will find that your interest in the justice system will exponentially increase just because Jack Ford is telling you how it works. I guess what I'm saying is - when they say shop your professors, not your classes, it's people like Jack Ford that they're talking about.",
    "Amazing seminar about trials of the 20th century, literally. Definitely take it. Little work load, huge payoff.",
    "Definitely",
    "Absolutely take it. One of the best professors I've had.",
    "If you get in, you would be ridiculous not to take this course. It convinced me that I want to apply to law school. Most enjoyable seminar I've taken at Yale. There's a decent amount of work but it's fun, and you can really enjoy it because class discussion focuses on relating the cases to current events rather than bogging down in the minutiae of each trial. And besides all that, you should take this class just to meet Jack Ford. He's the most fantastic professor I've had at Yale, hands down.",
    "Take it! such a fun class with Mr. Ford!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU CAN GET IN. Especially if you're a second semester senior. It's designed for you.",
    "Highly recommend it!!!!!!"
