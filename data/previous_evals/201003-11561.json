    "My main main concern is that the professor (transparently) favors architecture students over FES students. To the extent that forestry students are in the class to inform architecture practice and the architecture students rather than the other way around -- or an equal balance. This was a hard pill to swallow sometimes.",
    "Discussion-based classes often suffer from a lack of direction, which I think this class did to some extent. Still, the content was interesting and the professor did a good job of navigating through different ideas from the students."

    "Readings (some), final project.",
    "The opportunity to view the process of design from the perspective of architects. It is clear that there are differences in priorities that make the implementation of ecological design difficult. The class provided an opportunity to not only discuss those differences but experience them as well as architects and forestry students worked together."

   "comments": [
    "the professor, it seems, has too much on his plate. Simply, if given more attention the course would be more successful",
    "The instructor needs to be more organized and better at managing time so that class does not overrun the allotted time and that we can accomplish what is intended. He also needs to speak a bit more slowly.",
    "Deliverables need to be clearly outlined early on. We never knew what we were presenting when, or how long it should be. It's hard to be motivated to work on the project when your projects in every other class are very well defined in terms of deliverables and deadlines. I was more likely to put this class off for last because the instructor always sent out assignments last minute, so it seemed like he wanted the work to be last-minute. My schedule is extremely full. It is difficult for me to make last minute plans during the semester. So when I receive an assignment one or two days beforehand, I just can't fit it into my schedule. In this case, we even had an assignment sent out ON Thanksgiving. That was frustrating.The mini projects we did seemed shallow. I would have liked to spend more time on the final project and gone deeper with it.",
    "Felson can be hard to track down for meetings and help with assignments. Some of the readings were not helpful.",
    "The overall organization was lacking and made it difficult to get feedback as the course progressed. The absence of time management during the 3 hour class sessions caused the need for many meetings outside of class which were very difficult to schedule between architects, forestry students, and Professor Felson. I think it would be beneficial for the class to be split into separate meetings of lecture and 'reviews' or even a regular time for office hours so that there is a more structured schedule. I also think that there is some obligation on the part of the professor to include a syllabus that will be followed throughout the course from the beginning of the semester. The emails sent each week, only a few days before class with expectations for that week's session did not provide any opportunity to plan ahead and manage one's time in order to give the class a good effort on a weekly basis.",
    "Clarity on expectations. Providing assignments and readings with enough advance notice (more than a day or 2 before the next class)."

   "comments": [
    "the instructor did meet with students but at \"show up\" rate of only 60-70%",
    "Good. The instructor's insight and guidance was extremely helpful. We often got stuck. But after 5 minutes of conversation with Alex, everything made sense again.",
    "Great.",
    "Professor Felson was extremely busy and often moved meetings repeatedly. Considering the amount of investment he has in student projects (which was great) the entire class would run more smoothly if he set out regularly scheduled times for non-class meetings. In general I was frustrated by how difficult it was to schedule between architects and forestry students and the unreliability of professor Felson exacerbated the problem.",
    "While available and willing to help, offering his many great ideas added to our confusion and made it more difficult to focus and develop a particular idea."

    "Hard to schedule meetings, especially across schools. Also, the architecture students seemed less dedicated and interested in learning about the other side of the process.",
    "I had a great group. I only wish that we had to have more deliverables along the way for one project rather than multiple projects.",
    "The group work was key. It would have been better if there were more architects in the class. But it was better to work in groups of 3 than to have some groups be without an architecture student. That would have been awful.",
    "Great bringing architects and FES students together.",
    "I felt that the architects did not have as much interest in the course and that it was often pushed to the bottom of their priority list in place of their studio work. I also felt that, especially at the end of the semester, the forestry students were asked to sympathize unfairly with the 'busy architects'. We all have a lot of work, especially at the end of the semester, and I don't think the architecture students should be asked to pull any less weight in the class than the forestry students."
