   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot in this course that I was not expecting to learn. I really enjoyed working with the objects every seminar and learning from my fellow students. The course pushed me to accept a broader definition of art history.",
    "Having never taken art history before, it was great to learn how to really look at a painting and interpret it beyond \"horse in field with a tree.\"",
    "This class made great use of the collections around campus for engaging with materials not necessarily and usually under the purview of art history.",
    "This course gives you a wide overview of how nature is portrayed in art of the modern world. We went to the Peabody basement, the Cushing medical library (brains!), the YUAG and the YCBA, and the Beinecke, so this is a great opportunity to poke around parts of campus you might not have had time to explore yet. I had fun picking and researching my own topic for the final paper, and discussions were always interesting.",
    "This was the first art history seminar I have taken at Yale and I learned so much, and especially appreciated the small class size and valuable insight from the two professors that allowed me to learn so much. We began the course by discussing the history of natural history philosophers and then applied these readings to discussions of artworks in Yale's collections. With this format, I learned how natural history was conceived as a field of study and then translated into visual works of art. I also learned how to think critically about philosophical ideas and works of art in conjunction with each other. Overall, this course challenged me to look more closely and more deeply into works of art and how they connected to the theme of \"art, nature, and the modern world.\""

   "comments": [
    "The professors are great and highly organized. I did not love all of the readings.",
    "Strengths are definitely the co-teaching and sharing of expertise between the two professors and most importantly the engagement with real objects!",
    "Though the title implied an overly ambitious amount of material, the readings and material tied together beautifully.",
    "It's obviously a very broad theme, although you get to focus on a specific topic that interests you for the final paper. Sometimes I wasn't sure how the overall course made sense in terms of broader themes, but week by week it was always interesting and engaging.",
    "clearer through lines between different sections of material\/works",
    "Professor Bass and Raab worked very well together; it was exciting to hear both of their perspectives on the field coming from different areas of specialty. They encouraged exciting, thoughtful conversation.",
    "This course did a great job of connecting works of art to texts by philosophers, natural historians, artists, and more. The breadth of the reading each week allowed me to gain a deep understanding of a certain area of study within the theme \"art, nature, and the modern world\" and then apply the ideas I had learned and the ideas of my own I had formed to works of art through close looking and stimulating academic conversation. I can't think of ways to improve the course right now as I was really pleased with how it was taught and really enjoyed all the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about art in a very practical way I think that this class is great. You will not be surrounded by all art history majors, which I think creates a more relaxed environment if you're new to the subject.",
    "Yes, super great class where you go somewhere new on campus every week from Beinecke to the YUAG to the Peabody, etc. and get to interact with real objects. The intersection of history and science and history of art is really fascinating, especially since I've never taken a class that focused on this before.",
    "Absolutely ! As a STEM major I definitely benefited from connecting depictions of animals and plants to my own knowledge and background",
    "It was very exciting to have so much time outside the classroom looking at material.",
    "An amazing opportunity to explore! Highlights included looking at dinosaur bones in the Peabody (the definition of art is very broad in this course), flipping the pages in the Audobon books at the Beinecke, and looking at crazy weird medieval medical textbooks. The readings are totally manageable and always add depth to the class conversations. Make sure to really think about what you want to do for your final project.",
    "great professors, cool to bounce around yale collections. wish the class felt more cohesive in its material though.",
    "Yes! Very interesting intersection of art and science\/HSHM with heavy art object\/close-looking focus.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to other students. This course encouraged me to dive into a specific area of art history and apply the knowledge I learned to pieces of art in Yale's collections. Even students who are not majoring in the history of art should take this course because students who take this course should just have a passion for deeply exploring the intersection of natural history and art and be interested in better understanding the works Yale owns."
