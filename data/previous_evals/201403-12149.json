    "DONT, DO NOT take the class if you're not into the language or into classics. I had no prior experience with the language before Yale, and let me say that it sucks. The class's only saving grace is that it's taught by an amazing teacher.",
    "I recommend this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "It is an interesting class but do not slack off because its very fast paced",
    "This class can be fun. Latin is a very logical subject. This class can be a good option if you need a language credit, but don't want to have the amount of work you get from other language classes.",
    "This introductory course in Latin is very well-designed for beginner students. The pacing is very manageable, and the instructor is always willing to help out whenever needed. The weekly vocabulary and grammar quizzes are light enough as to not be too large of a burden on the student while simultaneously helping fortify knowledge of the subject. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning basic Latin.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is difficult but definitely worth it",
    "I definitely would; it has been a rigorous but comfortable course. It has taught me enough to be proficient at a basic level and has given me the foundation and confidence to take on texts of intermediate difficulty.",
    "I would recommend this course is taught again by Kyle."
