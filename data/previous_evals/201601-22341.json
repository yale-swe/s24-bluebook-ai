   "comments": [
    "The professor, Daryl, is one of the best glassblowers in the world. He's been working with glass for almost 30 years and can make pretty much anything. His demonstrations make it look easy, and you realize how amazing his work is when you sit down to blow glass yourself. You learn to make test tubes, T-hose connections, Vigreaux columns for fractional distillation, and a Hero's engine. Also he teaches you how to make marbles, which are fun to make. You can work on the glass shop whenever Daryl is there to supervise, and it's really fun to take an hour or two each week to make marbles. The glass lab is a hidden gem of Yale.",
    "One of the best courses that I have taken at Yale. You do three mini projects, and then a big final project using everything that you have learned. You're also welcome to come back at any time and continue your studies after the course.",
    "WOW take this if you can possibly get in. C'mon it's glassblowing. At Yale. I don't need to say anything more.",
    "You'll learn the basic glassblowing techniques while listening to some great, funky contemporary jazz -- making test tubes, sealing tubes together, etc. You'll also learn how to make marbles. Expect to work seriously though to accomplish all the projects. I would recommend only if you have the free time to work several hours outside of the slotted 9-10:15 and won't feel burned out waking up so early every Tuesday\/Thursday."
