    "Understood more about the history and the practice of Baroque Opera (performance and compositional techniques). Put this into practice by performing in the baroque opera production.",

    "Overall a fantastic course. I thought the lectures were, on the whole, more varied and interesting than last year's. I did find it hard to write the first essay because I had almost no source material to refer to. Perhaps a prompt that works for all characters equally would have worked better.",
    "The course provides students with a great opportunity to practice their skills but fails to provide students with the fundamentals that would allow them to do this in the best way possible. Thus, it requires that students come in with a certain level of knowledge... this seemed particularly evident with Italian diction.",
    "This show is both theatrically and musically challenging and was so much fun."

    "This class is one of the things at Yale that allows undergrads to bridge the gap between college and conservatory. It makes Yale special for serious singers. If you're interested in intensive performance and amazing productions, take this course.",
    "YBOP is such a great experience and can be very different based on the background that you come from and also the part that you are given. Either way, you will probably spend a lot of time practicing your music and in rehearsals, but in the end it is worth it for the high quality of the production and the amazing experience of working with high quality professors and performing on the University Theater.",
    "Best course ever!"
