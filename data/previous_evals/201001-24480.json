    "Four 800-word essays, one long piece about a person you will interview at length. Two revisions of the shorter pieces. Take it if you get in.",
    "DO IT--NO REGRETS",
    "This course is extremely strong - take it if you want to learn how to write about how we see other people, what we see of ourselves when we look at other people, and what we can't perceive at all. The work is moderate and well-spaced, the readings are mostly excellent, the syllabus is well thought-out, and Professor Zarin is lovely.",
    "It's great. Really about writing, not reporting.",
    "Profiles and Portraits is your basic profile writing class. There are 4 short assignments and a longer profile, so you're pretty much constantly working on something. There's a lot of leeway in what you write about and how you present the information, but there's also a good amount of direction and structure. There's reading every week, fun stuff mostly, and half the class is devoted to discussing what you read. The other half is workshopping.Zarin is kind of quirky, but she gives concrete feedback and runs a good discussion. I'm glad I took the class, but it wasn't as inspiring as I hoped. More technique, I guess. Lots of feedback in a short time and for not a ton of work. Interesting readings. Definitely worth trying."
