   "comments": [
    "Background to main themes of biological anthropology. Lab work with handling skeletal remains and archaeological evidence.",
    "This course gave me a new appreciation for human physiology and biology, and the ways biology and culture can interact. Additionally, this was my first exposure to human evolution in an academic setting, and I appreciate the knowledge I have gained from the course.",
    "This course went over a lot of material, but it was all fascinating! If I were to characterize this class, it would be about primate and hominid evolution. The lab section was quite fun and helpful.",
    "Each student will come away with a holistic understanding of human evolution and certain aspects of race, diet, and disease that still affect humans today.",
    "A better understanding of human evolution and primates, for sure.",
    "This course is a great survey course of evolutionary biology, and I really feel I developed a good understanding of major trends\/phenomena.",
    "I learned about human evolution and the intersection of biology with anthropology.",
    "I learned the basic workings of human\/primate behavior via genetic and ecological factors.",
    "I learned how humans evolved, from the basics of Darwinian evolution by natural selection and Mendelian genetics, to the characteristics of primates and how primates evolved over time into modern man. I learned fundamentals of genetics, including how polymorphisms can lead to mutations which can lead to natural selection (if those traits are favored). I learned about how evolution factors into modern humans, including whether or not race is a biological concept, why humans have the life history phase of childhood, and how diets have evolved over time (and how natural selection has factored into these changes).",
    "I think the min thing I learned from this course is larger than the fine details of human lineage. I learned more about how there is a connection between culture and biology. Through discovering the lineage of the human race through a biological lens, I was able to discover why humans act the way they do and ultimately accept the fact that I am a part of a species, an animal.",
    "I learned a TON about human evolution. If you're looking to take an intro level class that teaches you some cool basic facts about how humans became humans then this is a great choice. It's one of those classes that is straightforward, but involves a ton of information and discusses everything from what are the causes of our diet preferences to why our feet are shaped the way they are. Essentially, I'd call it a class that teaches you a bunch of fun cocktail party like facts.",
    "A lot of this class was human anthropology, anatomy and evolution. It gave us an insight into how anthropologists discovered and correlated evolutionary traits to lineages."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course itself is incredibly interesting, and the professor very knowledgable. The only difficulty is the occasional dryness of the lectures, making it very easy to zone out and miss important information. However, this course, though it is a little harder to engage in class, is well worth taking.",
    "Strengths - lecture slides accompanied the textbook very well, topics covered a variety of interesting areas of investigation in biological anthropology. Weaknesses\/improvement - faster grading of Psets.",
    "Strengths: Interesting subject matter for the most part, talk about cool things involving the evolution of mankind and different phenomenon. It's a course about the more fun and cool things you would learn in a bio class. Watts is a great guy. Very understanding. Weakness: Really slow pace.",
    "The lectures had interesting material, but the delivery was not very engaging. If the particular topic was not deeply intellectually intriguing, it was difficult to stay focused.",
    "There is a lot of course material, which is fantastic. However, there are sometimes questions on the problem sets that cannot be answered using lecture and section notes alone. Otherwise, this is a great class with incredibly intriguing content!",
    "This class did a great job providing specific details and trends that most stand out when analyzing human evolution. I particularly enjoyed the second half of the semester, with Neandertals vs. AMH, diets, disease, and race. i At times, the lectures could be a bit dry and sometimes Professor Watts would introduce too many examples to substantiate certain points. While I absolutely enjoyed the examples and tangents, it made lecture feel a bit disorganized. Lastly, the tests had some material that did not appear in lecture or was overly specific. Still, I found the tests to be tough but fair.",
    "I thought Prof Watts was accommodating, but perhaps the course could have been a bit more organized with a clearer arc.",
    "The course is very interesting and stimulating, although I think sections could be tied into the lectures a little better (they seemed kind of like two different classes almost).",
    "I thought the sections were really good; the materials in section (especially the bones and the tools) really complemented what we were learning in class and added another dimension to our understanding.",
    "The material is quite interesting but the lectures could get a bit droning sometimes",
    "One strength of this course is that many of the lectures focused on really interesting topics that are relevant today, especially in the second half of the course. I found the lectures on diet, race, and childhood to be really engaging and illuminating; it was valuable to see how evolution was affecting humans still today. I also thought section was a really cool way to see actual fossils (or casts of them) and to get to visualize the topics we were studying in lecture. I thought lectures were clear and interesting. To improve the course, I think there should be a little bit more organization for each lecture (maybe a brief outline of topics for each lecture would be helpful to stay organized). Sometimes it was hard to tell what information was essential and what was a side topic or anecdote.",
    "Strength: the course connected to a wide range of interdisciplinary topics that all students, irregardless of background in science, could potentially connect to and understand Weaknesses: lectures were boring and therefore hard to focus on, labs were unproductive and did not seem to offer students much more insight beyond lectures (part of lab time could have been spent more productively going over problem sets), midterm and final exam had questions that were too focused and specific relative to what we were learning in lecture",
    "I think the strength of this course comes from the nature of the topic. I think the going back to the past and tracing back all of the steps of the human species is something that is intrinsically interesting and appealing to all people. I think that the only \"weakness\" comes from how the units are structured. I think that the really interesting stuff comes at the end of the course especially when discussing the connections to modern human behavior and the differences between us and our ancestors. However, there is nothing that can really be done about this, and it is just my own personal opinion.",
    "Strengths: the subject material is very interesting and the class is organized in a great, very straightforward way that makes it easy to comprehend everything. Weaknesses: the lecture is slow at times which makes drifting off easy.",
    "The class is very lecture based which can make it easy for the student to become unengaged. I would suggest more questions or some way to keep us accountable for lecture to lecture learning."

   "comments": [
    "If you are not a science major, this course is great.",
    "I would recommend this course- it's interesting and covers a wide variety of topics, from genetics to evolution, and presents interesting context for thinking about issues regarding humans today, both health related and socially. If you are invested, you will learn a lot from this course.",
    "Yes! This is great introductory course for those interested in biological anthropology, material is graspable and very stimulating.",
    "I would recommend for an interesting science credit.",
    "Take it if you really need it for a Sc credit, or you really are interested by anthropology or biology. Otherwise it won't be a worthwhile\/engaging experience.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is in need of a science credit, but if the student is taking this class from pure interest or needs a social science credit, there are probably better options available. Nevertheless, a lot of the course material was interesting, it was just not presented in the most engaging format.",
    "Some things are interesting in this class, though lectures are very boring.",
    "I took this course for a Science credit and really enjoyed it! The material before the midterm is a little dry with all the primate fossils we look at, but with the Neanderthals, things become a lot more relevant and interesting. Professor Watts is a good lecturer, who deeply engages with the material. Weekly labs and occasional problem sets offer good opportunities for exam review.",
    "I would recommend the class to students looking for a science credit, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend the course as it is because I didn't find lectures to be incredibly engaging and felt the material was very specific and had little application beyond the class. It is also not an easy course.",
    "This is a super interesting class if you are at all interested in evolution, taxonomy, or genetics. I personally really enjoyed learning about the evolutionary timeline leading up to modern-day humans, with all of our special mutations and adaptations. The workload is reasonable and, honestly, pretty fun.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning more about human evolution and some aspects of human life like disease and diet. Lectures are dry but you walk away feeling like you learned some crucial things about human history.",
    "Sure, I think I learned interesting facts and new way of looking at humans, diets, etc.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who is interested in learning about evolutionary biology, especially non STEM majors. For STEM majors, it probably isn't in-depth enough, but for me it was perfect.",
    "Yes, i would recommend it to any student curious about the subject.",
    "It's a nice science credit.",
    "This was a solid class, and a good science credit for people who might not want to take a more intensive science class. At points lectures could be a bit dry and long, but overall I found the material to be interesting. Professor Watts is a really nice, really helpful, really knowledgeable professor. I found the classes at the beginning and end of the semester to be more interesting than the ones in the middle of the term.",
    "Not unless you need a science credit",
    "I would recommend this class to another student especially if they are looking to fulfill a science credit without having to take a \"hard\" science.",
    "If you're looking for a SC credit that isn't insanely hard, but also isn't a gut that wastes your time, then this is it. The class is straightforward and manageable work (and lectures can be skipped easily when you need some free time) but honestly includes a ton of cool information about human evolution and you'll leave it having learned some fun and interesting facts about anthropology. Overall, I'd say if you need a SC, then absolutely worth it."
