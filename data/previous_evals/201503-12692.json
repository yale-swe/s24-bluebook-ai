    "A good class to learn generally about different welfare typologies around the world. Good professor and engaging sections. I also enjoyed the fact that we learned how to do some simple quantitative analysis such as clustering.",
    "Conveys a full understanding of welfare policy in the Global South via comparative study.",
    "You need to be really interested in this area for this class to be worth it. The readings are dense and it often feels like you get nothing out of them. However, the final paper is a fun way to conduct your own research on a country of your choice and the rest of the work is relatively simple."
