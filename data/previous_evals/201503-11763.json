   "comments": [
    "Take this course even if you feel weak in math. I had not taken math in a long time and grounding the math in social sciences really made it easier and made me more comfortable with math. Tolga is the best - if you have the chance to take this course with Tolga, take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 108 for students looking to learn the basics of microeconomics with a legendary professor, TK.",
    "A lot of work, take it if you really want to learn microeconomics and you don't have the calculus background to take the other seminars.",
    "At first the challenge of economics seems daunting, and people will say to avoid the seminar because it is more work and more difficult--I say ignore those people. This was an excellent course made even better by Professor Koker. He is very supportive and accessible and there are measures like study groups implemented for further support so that you as a student in this course don't fall behind. Professor Koker is great at explaining the content and has a very clear and apparent understanding of the material that allows him to navigate it easily. This makes him a star at understanding and answering questions that come up. He works very hard to keep the class interesting, the material relevant, and his students sharp. I wholeheartedly recommend taking this course under his direction.",
    "It is a course that allows you to learn the tenets of microeconomics regardless of the level of math you've reached. I'd definitely recommend it to another student because it was so well taught and I learned so much.",
    "This econ class focuses on microeconomics with less mathematics involved. We get the derivatives, but still have to solve all the problems, obviously. I would recommend this class to another student, but remember that the curve is harsh in this class."
