    "Overall it was good",
    "Overall, I can't think of many weaknesses of the lab section. The PhD students were fantastic and really helpful, the field work was great, and my survived the lab work despite perhaps biting off more than we could chew. I liked that we were introduced to so many tools for field work, lab work, remote sensing and GIS, and presenting. The lab and the course could have been more closely tied together, for they often seemed disconnected and unrelated in subject matter until the very end of the semester when our final paper sort of could tie them together."
