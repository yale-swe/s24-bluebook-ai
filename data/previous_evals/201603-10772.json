   "comments": [
    "We learned how to read a novel closely for a specific trait, so that the volume of things to talk about in these long books was manageable. We also compared novels for their use of consciousness and learned how to apply theory in discussion.",
    "I had always wanted to read classics like Henry James' \"Portrait of a Lady\" and George Eliot's \"Middlemarch,\" as well as finally read Austen in a class setting. This was a pretty oversubscribed class, so everyone who did get in was excited to be there and pretty dynamic in discussion.",
    "A great introduction to and overview of the representation of consciousness and mental processes in the English novel. I especially enjoyed supplementing our literary readings with theoretical and critical texts.",
    "I feel like I became highly aware of and able to analyze the way minds are represented in novels, which is something I had mostly taken for granted beforehand. I adored many of the books that we read, and reading books I had already read but focusing on the representations of consciousness often made it feel like I was reading them for the first time.",
    "I developed a strong sense of what consciousness in a novel entails, how to recognize it, and how to parse the implications of its representation. I gained the ability to evaluate secondary sources and use the work of others to inform, but not supersede, my own thinking.",
    "The reading list is incredible, and I appreciate the time spent on the critical texts. I think the biggest skill developed is learning how to think critically about texts in response to others' criticism.",
    "This course was wonderful for enhancing close reading skills, as well as for developing sophisticated analysis of the text. Because of the specific eras the novels were written in, as well as the dominant theme of the course, the representation of minds in literature, there were many new literary methods and recurring deviices we learned, such as free indirect discourse as opposed to direct or indirect discourse, focalization, \"mind reading\" based on body language, etc. As a psychology double major, this course and its study of fictional minds was not only beneficial to my understanding of people as readers, writers, and imaginers, but as people interacting with other people in their daily lives as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is interesting, fun, and well-organized. The only weakness is that you never have enough time to talk about any one novel because the books are long, we read a lot of them, and we only meet once a week. It also might have been good to give a little more emphasis to the WGSS side of the course, since we never really talked about that.",
    "Overall, this is a very good course, and the syllabus is well-chosen. That being said, I believe the reading list could have been more varied in terms of authors. Instead of reading two novels by each of our authors (except for Eliot), we could have read only one work by each and explored other authors from the canon. This could have given us a richer perspective into ways of representing consciousness in fiction.",
    "The readings are fantastic, the Professor is phenomenal, and discussion was very well run. It is the only 2 hour seminar I've ever been in that didn't feel like it went on too long. In fact, I often felt like class went by far too quickly. One way in which the course could be improved would be if we could get specific passages to focus on sent out each week instead of only occasionally. Those passages were incredibly helpful for anchoring the discussion and I really appreciated them. Also, since the laptops in class were quite distracting (especially since a number of students were looking at things other than the reading), it would be great if we could have printouts of the reading or a reader or at least if people could be asked to close their laptops when not specifically looking something up in the reading.",
    "This course had a strong organization that allowed me to see the arc of the novel tradition from Austen to Woolf, focusing through the particular lens of consciousness. The concept of the course was perfect, and its execution was likewise amazing!",
    "Perhaps more opportunities for all people to speak could be made. rather than opening questions up to everyone every time, maybe there is a way for some people to present on certain novels or something so we could hear from more people.",
    "The course was extremely well structured and well paced. The extra readings outside of the novels were wonderful additions and helped direct reading of the novels themselves and focus of specific themes and techniques used. Perhaps including a wider range of authors could further improve study of various techniques."

    "If you can, take the class! Yeazell is an excellent seminar leader!! Each class was a nice mix of her clarifying\/addressing points in the text and students engaging with one another! Discussions did not always focus on answering broader questions proposed by yeazell but scattered at times; we would move abruptly from concepts and come back to them but always in a way that felt organic. Yeazell found something insightful in every comment and pushed back when appropriate -- all in all, creating a great seminar experience. She also gave extensive feedback on papers. The class is reading heavy. Probably about 200~300 pages a week (we went through middle march in 3 weeks). You can easily get away with not doing all the reading, if you so desire, but then what would be the point? Take the class: you get to read some great books with a great professor (Middlemarch is a masterpiece and the syllabus includes both Mrs. Dalloway and To The Lighthouse). I enoyed the class more for the experience rather than what I am taking away about \"consciousness\" or narratology (though I have learned about the latter too) The focus of the class seems to be more on narrative\/narratology then on \"consciousness\" (though the former certainly encompasses the latter). Definitely the emphasis is on the representation of consciousness than on consciousness itself. The cogniitive approach is not much explored except one or two theory of mind articles included in the syllabus.",
    "This course is SO GOOD. Professor Yeazell is kickass and wears leather pants while waxing eloquent on narrative theory. There's a lot of reading, but it's fun reading and she'll often send out passages to focus on, so I didn't find it to be a problem. The topic of the class is also really interesting, because representing other minds without using \"she thought\" or \"she said\" is quite difficult, and these authors are each amazing at it in their own way. So yeah. Take this class.",
    "This was a good, straight-forward course that I would take if you're interested in the reading list.",
    "Yes! A great introduction to and overview of the representation of consciousness and mental processes in the English novel. I especially enjoyed supplementing our literary readings with theoretical and critical texts. Prof. Yeazell is an amazing instructor who guides you well through the class material. However, you should be aware that the reading load is VERY heavy, even relative to other high-level English classes, and you should make sure that you will have the time every week to read the novels attentively. It's not only that the novels are simply long, but that they are usually very dense and demand a lot of time and attention.",
    "Like many seminars at Yale, the quality of the course was heavily dictated by the people who took it. I think we had a particularly articulate and observant crop of people--everybody contributed well to the conversation. During our first class discussion on Austen's \"Emma,\" I turned to one of my friends sitting beside me and said, \"I think this might be one of the best discussions I've ever had at Yale.\" And it was. Also, the reading list is magnificent--I'm eternally grateful at having been introduced to the writing of Henry James.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The readings were fantastic and Professor Yeazell makes every class engaging and enlightening. It is a lot of reading, but as long as you enjoy the books you read, it's very manageable. It's the only two hour seminar I've ever taken in which I felt like the time went by too quickly. It's an incredible class, and anyone with the opportunity to should absolutely take it.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The angle of consciousness was the perfect one to inform my understanding of these texts, and I wholeheartedly enjoyed each discussion. If one has any interest in Austen, Eliot, James, or Woolf, this course is a must!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students if they were confident enough to interject themselves in the conversation.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Students who are considering graduate study in literature as well as students who have an interest in psychology as well as literature will benefit greatly from this course. The selection of novels is also one that every student should read!"
