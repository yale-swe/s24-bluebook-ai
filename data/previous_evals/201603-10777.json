    "Learning to situate text and authors in their respective contexts, and deeply engage with their material",
    "A really thorough understanding and line of thought into a canon of important texts the interaction between the colonized and the colonizer.",
    "I had never written a paper longer than 12 pages before taking this class, so the 20 page paper was definitely a challenge and didn't turn out perfectly. However, I definitely learned about planning and researching such a long piece as well as learned a great deal about my topic.",
    "Many English courses discourage evaluating the material in terms of the historical\/cultural background and the author's psyche, so this was a welcome change."

   "comments": [
    "Prof Phillips is the best!",
    "An excellent course that focused on a diversity of writers",
    "Strengths: an incredible, insightful Professor who understands the texts on the level of craft as well as analysis Weaknesses: Because we only met once a week, it didn't feel like we were grappling with the material as a group as a much as we could.",
    "I don't really have a solution for this, but it was difficult to pick a topic for the final paper before we had gone through the course's reading list. It definitely felt like crunch time between submitting the proposal and finishing the paper, but I'm not sure how the course could be restructured to give us more time. It would at least have been helpful to have the paper due at the end of finals rather than at the end of reading period.",
    "Not really sure how to answer this question. It is a pretty standard seminar course, so it tends to be more flexible. Prof. Phillips was pretty good at directing the conversation without resorting to lecturing. Small class size was also very beneficial."

    "Yes, if they're interested in the topic being taught",
    "Yes if you are interested in reading the texts on the syllabus, there is no one more informed and invested in the themes and craft of post-colonial writing from Conrad to Ondaaje as much as Caryl Phillips. He personally knows these guys.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Phillis is charming,clever, isnightful and open, and the class is almost entirely based on your interactions with him. It is a pleasure to get to do so.",
    "Yes. Definitely a seminar designed for English majors. Plan for the 20-25 page paper accordingly."
