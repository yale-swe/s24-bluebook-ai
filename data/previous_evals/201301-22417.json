    "yes but study very hard for each exam",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to. I needed to take calculus, so I took it. If you take it, be sure that you go to class. Lots of people will skip and learn nothing and do very poorly on the exams. Yes, it's a pain, but well worth going to those 2.5 hours every week. You're here at Yale, go to class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student unless they need to take it. The exams were difficult and the instructor was not engaged in teaching the basics of calculus. I think it was difficult and did not provide a good basis for higher levels of mathematics.",
    "Take it only if you really have to. There is nothing exciting about this class, but you will come out knowing the very basics of calculus.",
    "It teaches you the beginnings of calculus at a fairly fast pace.",
    "It's calculus of a single variable. The course covers calc all the way up to integrals.",
    "Math 112, to the extent of my knowledge, is not generally a course that people take because they want to, they take it because they have to. Many STEM majors require that you complete Math 115 and if you're pre-med you need a year of Math so starting with 112 is a good way to start Calc, prepare for 115, and fill up the required year of Math.",
    "Mathematics 112 is a course that is supposed to function as an introduction to calculus but in order to do well, especially in comparison to the other students, exposure to calculus beforehand is definitely needed. I would only recommend this course to a student if they have had calculus before",
    "I would recommend the course if you need this specific requirement. Otherwise, I would recommend taking a different math course or taking basic calculus somewhere else. If you take this course you will likely need outside help to fully understand the concepts.",
    "Take this course if you need it for your major or didn't take AP Calculus in high school."
