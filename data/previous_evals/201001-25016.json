    "Great class. Really chill. Probably my favorite class so far; we just listened to music and talked about it. How else would you spend your time? You should totally take it.",
    "This is a fantastically useful class if you're a singer, arranger, composer, or any other kind of musician. While it may be hard, and somewhat onerous at times, it's completely worth it.",
    "It's a fun class, very helpful for your musicianship, and can work wonders if you put the time in to challenge yourself.",
    "This is a great class - very fun and - while challenging - not a stressful class.",
    "It's kind of fun, just early. No work outside of class which is nice, but I am not a pianist so I struggled more than I would have wanted to with the keyboard lab.",
    "Useful course as a musician-- ought to be taught more like a language class, but you get a lot out of it as is.",
    "Music 219 picks up right were 218 left off. The major objective of the course is to improve dictation skills by practicing longer and more complicated dictations. I would absolutely recommend this course: it is rewarding and not a lot of work. If you can, take it with Sarita - she is awesome!"
