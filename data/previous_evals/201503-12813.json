    "Senior colloquium is a great way of preparing to write the WGSS senior essay. Small assignments throughout the semester help prepare you for the final presentation and ultimately for working on the thesis next semester. I feel much more ready to write my thesis now than I did at the beginning of the semester, and much of that is thanks to this course.",
    "LOL THESE COMMENTS R USELESS BECAUSE U HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS BUT IT IS FUN AND THERE IS WINE ALWAYS",
    "Senior Colloquium is great. You really get to know your fellow majors, and form a small learning community (and maybe even a family!) by the end. It's a great way to amp up your engagement in your thesis, and feel like a scholar-in-training as a college senior. One of the great parts of the WGSS major.",
    "This course is only for seniors in the WGSS major, but it's a great way to start making progress on the daunting senior thesis process!"
