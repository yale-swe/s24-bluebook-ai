    "I learned much about the media landscape and how it shapes democracy. The course readings were very interesting and informative on the successes and failures of modern media and how the changing media landscape has impacted our government and everyday lives. As far as writing, I feel I became a more clear and concise writer and learned how better to develop an argument.",
    "My writing improved greatly in this course and taught me important analytical skills when reading through various texts.",
    "I learned a lot in this in terms of both writing and the media as a whole. I think that my writing tremendously improved and I think that I will take these skills with me and develop them further. The class provided a great foundation for my writing skills.",
    "I learned many new writing skills and a more in-depth understanding of media techniques.",
    "I learned not only critical writing skills but also how to speak up in class. This class gave me many insights into journalism and what goes on behind the scenes, why journalism can be corrupt, and what we can do about it. Furthermore, this class also gave me courage to stand up in the world.",
    "I learned to write clearly and concisely. I also learned that the media has much more control over the political agenda than many people percieve.",
    "I became better at not using passive voice in my writing and also mixing in more warrants in my writing. I also learned how media and democracy are connected and how the internet and the Digital age is changing media."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest weakness of this course was that the readings and other assignments often distracted from the focus on writing. Too often we would discuss contemporary issues and all of the reasons why Republicans are bad instead of working on our writing assignments and receiving feedback. It would be helpful if the assignments were more closely mirrored to the readings or if the class time was more appropriately divided. This course was strong in teaching the intended content- writing and understanding democracy and the media.",
    "There were strengths to this course. As stated earlier, a major strength was how I bettered my writing skills, as well as how I analyzed sources and readings. I also learned how to write more concisely. I do not think that I could think of any major weaknesses.",
    "Strength is that it has a lot of potential. Weakness is that the writing style is specific to the teacher, so many meetings are required (not necessarily bad I liked talking to her)",
    "Strengths Relevant topic Well designed curriculum and readings Robert McChesney interview was great! Weaknesses Presentations at the end of the class took a little long. I would have prefered more guest lecturers\/speakers."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. I feel it was poorly directed and the writing skills that I did learn came at a cost and a workload far too high. I felt like much of our class time was simply a waste of time talking about contemporary issues in a very one sided echo-chamber of ideas.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, as I gained a better understanding of the importance of media in our society.",
    "Yes I would reccomend this class because I think it really helps students improve their writing.",
    "If they're really passionate about the subject and about learning to become a better writer, then yes.",
    "Yes. It involves a relevant course subject and the professor teaches you to write.",
    "Yes. The course was not only useful for improving my writing skills, it was also interesting and very important for understanding how media and democracy are connected."
