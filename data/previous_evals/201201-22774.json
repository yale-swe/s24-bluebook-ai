   "comments": [
    "This is a survey course on Russian history from around 1700 to 1917, with a focus on foreign policy and the Russian periphery (Poland, Ukraine, Central Asia, etc.) Prof. Bushkovitch is hilarious, but he also tends to ramble. Courseload is incredibly reasonable (three short papers, totaling 9 pages, and a final) and class is interesting. Definitely take it if you're interested in Russia, but also consider this class if you're interested in the history of Western Europe. Prof. Bushkovitch shows how Russia played an integral role in 19th century Europe, something which is often forgotten or tacked on as an afterthought in other courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's not too strenuous at all and you manage to learn a lot and absorb a ton. You don't read many primary sources at all, so it's all about the story, which reminds you of high school history classes. A ton of fun.",
    "Great history class.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend!",
    "Professor Bushkovitch is super competent and can talk uninterruptedly about almost anything you ask for at least 15 minutes! The lectures are interesting but intense, so pay attention, especially since the final is worth most of the grade.",
    "Good Credit\/D class. Not much work, and Bushkovitch is an interesting lecturer. I learned a lot about Russia doing this class.",
    "Russian History is a great class: Prof. Bushkovitch is a good lecturer and extremely knowledgeable. With a small class, he would always spend part of the class fielding questions, which was an added bonus. The assignments and final exam were a little nebulous, but that's my only complaint.",
    "GREAT CLASS. take it. it can get a little boring at the end of class but you learn a lot.",
    "A fascinating summary of Russian Imperial and Foreign Policy. It's a straightforward lecture course, but with a great deal of reading. Not all of the reading is particularly useful, and it can be hard to figure out precisely what Professor Bushkovitch expects from you. That said, he's a genius, and his lectures are brilliant. The workload is comparatively light.",
    "History 295 is an interesting course about a rather overlooked topic in world history. Professor Bushkovitch knows so much about Russian history, so while the class focuses on the empire and foreign policy you end up learning about 400 years of general Russian history also. Be warned the final is worth a ton of the overall grade, but is very vague in direction to prepare for.",
    "I would recommend History 295 to another student. The provided a great window into the history of a region of the world that I am not very familiar with. Again, I wish there was more consistency of the paper grading of the two book reports.",
    "Take this class. Not too much work.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. RUSSIA MATTERS.",
    "If you like Russian history or just straightforward history, take this course. There are not many assignments and no section. However, Professor Bushkovitch does assign a lot of reading, which can be fairly dry. His lecture style is very straightforward and to the point. No frills attached. But if you like history, it's always interesting. Professor Bushkovitch is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and rather blunt (which can be quite funny). The course covers a lot of material, but I feel that I now have a good grasp on pre-Soviet Russia. Shop it!",
    "Yes if you want to learn about Russian history. Yet, this is class for foreign policy of the Russian Empire, and is not domestic history. So if you want to learn about the latter, you might want to look into other classes offered.",
    "Yes, best Russian history class"
