   "comments": [
    "The class is a close reading of textual evidence requiring knowledge of the primary language. It's attention to detail in its line-by-line exposition of the text at hand enables students the opportunity to dig deep into the meaning of the text and its background. It is certainly a recommended class for those looking to put their practical knowledge of language and criticism to work."

    "This course enabled me an opportunity to treat a fundamental text of the Dead Sea Scrolls in close detail under the direction of a leading Dead Sea Scrolls scholar. In the very least, it has reinforced my essential knowledge of the Dead Sea scroll community and textual corpus. Beyond that, it has allowed me an opportunity to explore some particular questions of mine about the community. I am unsure presently how directly this will contribute to future doctoral work\/research. But certainly it has expanded my essential knowledge of the scrolls.",
    "The highlight of this course to me was the variety of topics that the class touched on in relation to the Community Rule. Since the group of students in the class was so diverse, we were able to relate 1QS to rabbinic studies, archaeology, etc., which broadened my understanding of the document's importance."
