    "It helped me realize the importance of the past and the application of theory in reality, great course",
    "Economic development theory in the past 30 years, and the growth strategies different countries, such as China, India, Japan, Korea, and Latin America took to facilitate growth.",
    "The best macropolicy Econ class you could take at Yale!",
    "A lot of knowledge into how economic thought on development has evolved and the major deficiencies of the field.",
    "This course, for me, was all about contextualizing economic policy, be it within national contexts through the case studies (Japan, Brazil, India, China, Korea) or within the overall transformation of development theory over the past seventy years or so. In this sense, not only did I gain in-depth knowledge of how exactly some of the greatest success stories of development were carried out, but also the forces in play (political, ideological, historical) that determined these paths. This course gave me a great appreciation for the importance of economic history in understanding the present state of any nation, and I think it is an important course for anyone interested in the study of development. The greatest lesson you learn is that there is no one size fits all policy for development: successful policies are those that vibe best with a country's political-economic reality at the time."

    "It could be improved by showing case studies of countries that failed",
    "Strengths: Engaging Readings, Professor is knowledgable and passionate about economic development, Lectures are interesting and in depth Weaknesses: Not too much time for discussion, would appreciate more instruction for papers",
    "More instructions and individual feedback would be great",
    "Strength: The professor was very engaging and gave a lot of insight. The topics were extremely interesting. The readings were long but insightful Weakness: Rubric for papers should be a little clearer. Sometimes there wasn't enough time dedicated to class discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it because it is a pragmatic approach to economy",
    "Yes I would! Especially to people interested in a large overview of economic growth by various countries since 1950s.",
    "Yes. Prof Mohan is a living legend and a great teacher",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in economic development. This is a very important course to understand the more Macro aspects of economic development. The professor is very engaging, and the topics are never dull.",
    "I would say this course is incredibly important to anyone interested in economic development: the history component is incredibly important for those with more of a model-based econ background, and the economic component is vital for those with more of a humanities background. It definitely requires some background in economics, and it can be a bit daunting for those with less of a rigorous focus on the field at first, but I myself learned quite a lot about basic economics through the case studies. A wonderful, eye-opening class. Doing the readings is very important if you want to get the most out of the class, as you can only discuss so much in two hours."
