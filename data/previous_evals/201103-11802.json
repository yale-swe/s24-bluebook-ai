   "comments": [
    "Great course IF you really like linguistics. If not, you're going to hate it. Daily work is not too bad, but you have to learn the IPA on your own. If you know you won't learn it without being assigned to learn it, you aren't going to do well in this class. However, you will get a good introduction to phonetics and will learn a lot of stuff you wouldn't learn otherwise. But, if you don't plan to continue with Linguistics, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "While it's not everyone's cup of tea, I definitely feel like a more prepared and qualified linguistics major having taken phonetics. I think it's a great class. It's really not too demanding on a weekly basis, and ifyou do the readings and study for the two exams, it would even be a great 5th class.",
    "It is a great class and it is very interesting. Transcription and production of every sound in the world languages becomes very interesting during the course.",
    "Linguistics 120 requires great work. I would not recommend this course if the person is not considering Linguistics as a major.",
    "I would very much recommend this class to any linguistics major interested in phonetics or phonology. It is a great class!I would recommend this class somewhat less strongly if you think that 'it's really cool' and don't feel like putting in a ton of work. It IS really cool, but you will also work quite hard.",
    "Great class. Fascinating material. Gives you an idea of the diversity of the field of linguistics. The professor is great, but you've gotta be on your toes during class, as she moves quickly and doesn't post lecture slides online. There's a lot of material, but the homework is easy, the final project is interesting, the exams are fine if you review the material, and you get to learn to perceive and produce all the crazy sounds from the world's languages. Highly recommended for anyone and everyone."
