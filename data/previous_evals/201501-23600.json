    "I did not participate in the Tuesday discussion sessions so I cannot give a fair assessment of Gordon and Jena's work, but at least from all the great speakers they brought in, I think they did a fantastic job.",
    "Overall, the course was very enjoyable, and I do think that I learned quite a lot. However, it sometimes seemed as though we covered a wide variety of topics somewhat superficially. It would have been nice to dive into some topics a little more deeply, though actually doing that within the guest-lecture-heavy structure of the class might be a challenge. One particular thing that might have been helpful would have been to have some required texts\/articles other than the ones suggested by the guest speakers. This is for a few reasons--many of the guest speakers were late in providing materials, some of the readings were essentially promotional materials, and having outside readings that provide a more critical perspective\/framework might create some really interesting discussion."

    "The guest speaker series was the most valuable aspect of the class. I would agree that most of the speakers gave me new insights into the food system even if they weren't what I was expecting walking in to the lecture.",
    "The guest speakers were excellent.",
    "The best aspects were being able to hear from practitioners in all aspects of the food system, and getting multiple inside perspectives that would be hard to get otherwise. I also appreciated how I could still get 1 credit for the course just by coming to the guest speaker sessions, which I would have done anyways since they are all very interesting.",

   "comments": [
    "Not cohesive, not comprehensive, and some of the speakers were fairly myopic or out of touch, beyond their academic niche -- lack of a baseline or common ground established by the professor for students and speakers -- frankly, it was obvious the professor was using the course in order to gain awareness of food issues himself, which is fine, Jena did a great job of curating and hosting herself, but I would have expected more from the professor. All of this was perfectly acceptable to most I suppose because it was low-stakes, the majority of students took the course for one easy credit -- but it does not fare well for an enormously important and broad topic that is otherwise direly under-taught and largely misunderstood by professors at FES.",
    "A stronger reading list and more continuity from week to week would be helpful for students who do not have a background in food systems. It would also be good to have an instructor for the class who has more expertise in food -- Gordon does a great job, but it's not his field.",
    "There was minimal feedback for the assignments and presentations. It would have been valuable to get feedback from previous assignments to make adjustments and improve. Having readings or a source textbook to assign readings from would have help with the flow and background information for the class. While I realize that the speakers do not necessarily follow the topics assigned to them, even any preview through the readings would have helped to organize the class thematically. This would also ensure that the entire class isn't necessarily reliant on the guest lecture of the week.",
    "Somewhat by the nature of the course, driven by guest speakers with limited coordination among themselves, it was not always clear how the contents of the guest lectures connected to others or to the big picture. So a doing a brief recap of how the guest speaker's topic fits into the big picture before or during speaker introductions would be a good way to ground the contents to a bigger picture.",
    "More practitioners",
    "As I mentioned above, the readings and response papers probably needed improvement. It was a little frustrating to see some of the readings get uploaded late, which made it a bit of a challenge to keep to a schedule for getting response papers in. It also would have been nice to have some readings that were more theoretical.",
    "More incentive to take it for 3 credits, like a field trip."

Knowledge gained did not necessarily surpass an equal amount of time spent alternatively, alone on the web, googling the speakers, reading articles and watching videos -- which is too bad.",
    "Yes, It was a good introduction to a variety of problems in the food system and how they are being addressed, and introduced me to some companies and groups that I was not familiar with.",

Anticipate that the level of sophistication in thinking about food will be woefully elemental, and the execution of the course will be a bit fumbly and poor, or at least it would have been this year were it not for Jena's active role. Spending time over lunch after the class with interesting speakers is perhaps the most promising value-add in taking this course.",
