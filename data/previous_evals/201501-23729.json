    "As is his wont, Prof. Martenson has structured his course to provide a logical sequence of revelatory epiphanies for his students. The course is exceptional.",
    "I wish it were easier to get my hands on the movies, and that there were more consistency about where on classes V2 readers were located (though this was much much better this semester from last)",
    "It was sometimes difficult to access movies as there were only a few copies or one copy at the library. It would be nice if there were multiple copies that did not have a 24 hour deadline or two hour deadline. It just added stress to an already stressful semester to try to find time to get, watch, and return a video in twenty four hours."

   "comments": [
    "One possible improvement would be the giving of more individualized feedback. In the fall course, there were check-in opportunities over the semester, including quizzes, evaluations, or printed homework, that allowed students to periodically understand where they were in the course of their learning. This course was essentially only the reading, writing, and discussion. Of course that's where the learning happens, but a few opportunities to check in about progress over the course of the semester would have been helpful.",
    "It might be beneficial to have us bring in our own scenarios from time to time to get feedback on things we've experienced too. I like using the case studies but there are times that it would be interesting to self reflect on our own leadership beyond what we did in the last assignment."
