   "comments": [
    "I learned about the natural history of Ecuador, experienced different field stations, collected plant and bird census data, spoke with several local experts and scientists, international scientists, and local and international participants and leaders of NGOS involved in research and environmental issues in Ecuador. I learned the basics of how to conduct data collection, analyze data, and write up the results. I gained insight into how logistics factor into field work and data collection.",
    "Field experience. Birding skills.",
    "This was my first graduate school course, so I thought it was a great way for me to learn how graduate school courses are structured. The course was also a good exercise in the scientific process in general, and the different ways that ecological questions can be answered.",
    "This course provided a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to witness and appreciate first hand the extraordinary biodiversity of the tropics. Learning about tropical systems and seeing them up close was really eye-opening in a way that a class with no field component cannot be.",
    "I learned that ecosystems, especially tropical ecosystems, are mindbogglingly complex. It was both humbling and inspiring to see for myself how hard it is to test elegant theories in the field. I learned that the lack of translation and information exchange between researchers in different countries is a huge inefficiency in the scientific project. I learned that citation trails are often flawed, and that accepted procedures are often not justified. I somewhat tempered my judgement of oil extraction in the Amazon after seeing how much better managed is block 16 compared to previous locations. I gained familiarity with tropical plants and birds, learned a lot of R programming and data analysis, and developed my research practices. I learned about a region and culture that I had no prior experience with.",
    "Knowledge of characteristics of Ecuadorean tropical ecosystems at different altitudes\/temperature-precipitation regimes. Human impacts to the regions. Biodiversity trends. I was able for the first time to conduct field research in ecology\/evolutionary biology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -breadth of knowledge in lectures -clearly defined learning goals at the beginning of the class -hands-on experience from the field trip -going through the process of writing a scientific project from start to finish -learning from experts in local plants\/animals -speaking with Ecuadorians about their experience and work in ecology in Ecuador -getting to meet other students and researchers at the research station Weaknesses: -lack of discussion time in lectures -lack of discussion about individual projects prior to trip -lack of discussion of the key features of the common families of tropical birds, how to identify, and field methodology for survey (esp. relative to the time required to dedicate to bird watching\/identification) Suggested Improvements: -more outside of class work (reading) in the beginning of the course, paired with a discussion-based chunk of time in class each week -have one whole class on how-to: what a scientific paper contains, how it is structured, what a good research question is, and how to respond to such a question with a research project BEFORE going on the trip. make people come up\/refine tentative research questions (maybe as a class discussion for the group project - individual projects should still be left more open-ended until everyone has seen the ecosystem)",
    "It is better to let the students do the literature review first, prior to going to the field.",
    "I thought that the class time spent before the spring break could have been more organized and coherent. I didn't gain anything from the class until we got to the field trip, and even then, I'd estimate that only half of the lectures helped me with what we were doing in the field. Maybe the lectures, which were admittedly short, could have been more topical. I thought the field trip was a strength in teaching me what field science can be like, and it was amazing to see the different landscapes of Ecuador. It was a lot of travel time, but I honestly did not mind that much because we were on a tight schedule. I would have maybe appreciated more time\/guidance for the projects that we had to conduct, though, because I felt rushed and lost regarding them.",
    "The opportunity to design and conduct an individual research experiment is a huge strength of the course. However, this could have been a bit more beneficial if there was more planning and organization. For example, before the trip to Ecuador, we spent no time thinking of tractable research questions or field methods. In general, more preparation prior to going to Ecuador would have been valuable.",
    "The Ecuador trip was an amazing experience! I truly cannot describe how much this class changed my perspective on the world. It is one thing to watch documentaries or read papers about a place, it is totally different to wade across a flooded stream in the poring rain, make eye contact with a baby jaguar, be surrounded the explosions of epiphytic life in the cloud forest, talk to local scientists over meals, and slug through cow patties to find Oilbirds. Nothing can come close to how our brains absorb information by experience, and I am so honored to have had this one. The only improvement to the course that I can think of would be to have the background portion of the papers due before the trip. That way, students have to do all of the research before hand and really understand established procedures and current gaps before designing their own experiment.",
    "strengths: independent project, group project drove home core principles. weaknesses: we spent nearly three classes talking about biodiversity trends and I feel we could have spent that time learning other more useful information."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. The opportunity to get hands on experience is rare. The trip was a unique learning opportunity.",
    "I wouldn't recommend a PhD student who already has field work and publication experience to take the course. Highly recommended for undergraduate students who wants to know how the process of doing research.",
    "I'd recommend this course wholeheartedly if you're interested in the tropics and in field ecology. I personally learn things by doing, so this course was definitely rewarding in how much I felt like I learned while in the field.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in biology field research.",
    "Absolutely take the course if you get in! There is only so much you can learn from books and papers, it is totally different to do a field course that goes to the tropics. I made amazing friends and had literal once in a lifetime experiences. If you have never been to the tropics before it is hard to describe the complexity and biodiversity. I highly recommend doing the background readings if you are not very familiar with the area, as these will give you a greater appreciation for what you see and do when you are there.",
    "I would recommend, especially to E&EB majors who want a taste of field research, and want to learn about a really cool, biodiverse region!"
