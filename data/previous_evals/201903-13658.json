    "One of the main strengths was certainly the range of materials covered and the choice of secondary readings, which allowed students to capture new aspects in authors and texts they may have already been familiar with and to approach new authors with even greater curiosity. Sometimes there were maybe too many primary texts assigned for one session, which made it impossible to cover everything, but it was still incredibly useful to have access to such a vast range of sources.",

    "Yes, I would. I think anyone working in humanities should take a class like this one."
