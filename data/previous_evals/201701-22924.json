    "This course revived my interest in philosophy from a long, slow death. Professor Harries' lectures are an education in themselves.",
    "I think most importantly, I got a clear vision of Professor Harries' view of philosophical history. There is some progression, but it's not dialectical, and we shouldn't expect to be overturning radically new ground (\"the 13th century was more radical on the theme of freedom than he 20th century.\").",
    "This course was helpful on a number of different levels. First of all, it offered a useful overview of key texts by major philosophers like Kant, Fichte, and Heidegger. But, second, it also situated these texts in new constellations -- the most interesting of which were often literary, and not, at first, obviously relevant to the broad philosophical and metaphysical concerns through which the instructor interpreted them. That he was recurrently able to show how to read these literary texts in view of particular philosophical problems was a useful demonstration of a particular mode of doing philosophy that is sometimes hard to come by."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely loved this course, needs no improvement.",
    "This course was obviously very \"traditional\" in that Professor Harries read off of notes. But he did take questions, just most people didn't ask questions. He often had extremely interesting things to say in response to questions. This course was amazing, it just required a lot of focused listening.",
    "The strengths were the instructor's clarity and wide-ranging knowledge. The class might have been improved by a little bit more discussion."

    "Alas, Professor Harries is retiring. Otherwise, I certainly would.",
    "Yes yes yes!! I'm not sure if Prof. Harries is teaching again but if he does then take any\/all of his courses, they're an absolutely amazing learning experience and are always the best part of my academic semester.",
    "This requires extensive knowledge of the subject, and would be of interest to anyone with the adequate philosophical lexicon, but nonetheless is a scintillating class that challenges and questions the direction of our society today.",
    "Yes! Unfortunately for all of us, Dr. Harries has since retired. One would be hard-pressed to find a course that could be replicated with so much passion and insight.",
    "Yes, although it's a moot point because Professor Harries is retiring. A course like this certainly requires a lot of background in philosophy in order to engage fully with the content and arguments. It's the kind of course that makes something like Yale's Directed Studies program worth it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course because of the way in which it explains and elaborates the connections among such a wide assortment of texts. I would note, however, that the instructor mostly lectures, and does not devote too much time to student questions, even though he is usually happy to make room for them."
