   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in using papyri in their research. The course as a whole is a good introduction to how the field of papyrology is organized and always developing. The final project gives an excellent idea of how papyri are published and the caution one should bring to using papyri in research. The workload is not extraordinary, but one must really do the readings to appreciate class time fully.",
    "The course is fast-paced and can be difficult to follow. I would recommend the course to a student who enjoys being self-taught and doesn't mind frustrations on the path to knowledge.",
    "This is an excellent, hands-on approach to learning about the discipline of papyrology. I think that this course is relevant for all graduate students in Classics, Religious Studies, and Near Eastern languages, even if one is not interested in becoming a papyrologist, per se. I learned a great deal about the transmission of texts and also about Roman Egypt. If given the chance to write a term paper on a papyrological subject or to prepare a previously-unpublished papyrus for publication, do the papyrus. It might be more work in the long term, but it's so rewarding to actually use the skills that you've learned in looking at other published papyri. You'll also come away with a huge sense of personal ownership of a document that may not have been read in thousands of years."

   "comments": [
    "This course was my first real engagement with papyrology, and so it easily doubled or tripled what I knew before. I now feel confident in using papyri in other research projects when appropriate, which was my personal goal for the course.",
    "I learned a great deal about manuscript traditions\/transmission via the papyrological record, and also about domestic life in Roman Egypt and provincial life in Roman Egypt. I intend that the knowledge gained from this course will be relevant to my future studies by having given me the tools to understand the life and evolution of Greek literary works once they have been published.",
    "The course introduced an entirely new subdiscipline to me. Although I had no experience in it before, I feel that I can now speak with confidence about this increasingly significant field."
