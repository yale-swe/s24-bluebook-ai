    "This class certainly expanded my range and confidence as a writer. Be prepared to have your poetry cut down if you have Cynthia Zarin, but really her edits are always improvements. Worthwhile class, low courseload if you want (if you're properly editing then its a fair amount of work, but this isn't checked so up to you). The more you put in the more you'll get out of it, but its a poem a week, a midterm paper, and. An anthology of 5 revised poems at the end. Also one recitation, and there isn't much notice, so pick something early if you struggle with memorization. Workshops can be slow at first but as you all gel as a class they become more useful. You also get to read some great poetry!",
    "An excellent introduction to writing page poetry. I would suggest it to any budding writer.",
    "Worth taking if you have an interest in poetry or writing in general. Basically a writing workshop each week with a relatively light workload."
