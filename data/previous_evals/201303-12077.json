    "Yes, if you're looking for a fun, relaxed course... no exams but a 12-15 page paper",
    "If you are considering grad school for clinical psych and\/or want to learn more about what mental health professionals do (or just about mental healthcare in general), there is NO reason why you should not take this course. You learn a ton about therapy, interventions, treatment programs, etc.Kristi is super nice--a bit quirky, but in a great way--and she really cares about teaching.The seminar is very relaxed and you will probably become close to your class. Like any 2 hour seminar, it can get dull at times, but in general it is fun and interesting.The course involves lots of fun exercises like nature walks and walking around New Haven while listening to an audio track that simulates auditory hallucinations.In general, the workload is not bad. There are NO exams or quizzes, and the readings are usually manageable and interesting (the readings for 1 or 2 weeks were a tad longer\/more difficult). The class does involve a considerable amount of writing, however. There are weekly reading responses as well as journal entries that reflect on your field placement and on your \"triad\" exercises. The field placement involves volunteering 2-4 hours a week at a mental health center (or something similar). The triad exercises (only have to do these 3-4 times per semester) involve practicing therapeutic techniques in small groups and are pretty fun.The final paper isn't too bad either--12-15 pages. You have to incorporate the readings, but a lot of it is your own thoughts and opinions relating to mental health.I highly recommend this course!!!",
    "One 2-hr weekly class talking about some aspect of clinical psychology, either in how to carry out a relationship between helper\/therapist and client, or about mental disorders in general, or about psychiatry and issues surrounding it. Then, attendance weekly at a specified placement in the greater New Haven area to work with clients.",
    "A class that combines the two most important things: no stress and lots of important content. Professor Lockhart is hilarious and cares far more about really helping people than forcing students to memorize and analyze rigorously. Although the field placement is a large part of the course, I actually found the topics we studied in seminar most intersting. Abnormal presented an extremely sanitized version of psychology and this class shows you how things are in the real world (and frequently, they're pretty worrying). For anyone thinking of a career as a psychologist, this class is essential.",
    "This is a year long so make sure you are ready to commit to the whole year. Very laid back course that meets once a week usual with a snack. Talk about current issues in mental health care. Really enjoyed the triad component in which you are placed in a group with a few other peers to practice helping\/listening skills. Also it is great that this class includes a placement. Some placements are better than others. Class could be improved by ironing out placement options before the start of the term. A little more organization is needed to have placement stuff ready since many people could not even start until after October break.But yes, take it if you are interested in learning more about mental health care and having a hands on experience.",
    "Yes! It's a great class. It's super interactive and so you get exposed to the field of practicing psychology for the first time, because you have a placement and you get assigned into groups where you get to practice your therapeutic skills. Furthermore, in class you learn really important information about the field of psychology and mental health in america.",
    "If you're interested in being a therapist, psychiatrist, social worker, etc., then this course is perfect for you. If you're not, then it's probably not worth your time. The actual class meeting is more of a lecture than a seminar, but the material is very relevant to helping professions. Professor Lockhart is a bit scatterbrained, but she's a total sweetheart and is incredibly passionate about the material, which I really appreciate. The course isn't a ton of work, though the thought questions (reading responses) can take longer than you think they will. The field placements, from what I've heard, can be kind of hit or miss, but I loved my field placement at New Haven Academy! Same thing with the triads, but again, mine worked out really well! If you're thinking about taking this course, make sure you can commit to the full year, since you are required to take both semesters. Overall it's great as a psych major who wants to go into clinical psychology, but I think it could be a bit boring for those who aren't as specifically interested in the topic.",
    "Very interesting course for students interested in clinical psychology in practice. One class meeting per week (usually a lecture on an aspect of clinical psychology, not that much discussion). You will also be assigned to a triad that meets a few times each semester to practice \"helping skills,\" as well as be assigned to a field placement. However, in our particular class, many people were not able to start their field placement until late November due to the security\/background checks. Whilethis is unfortunate, it is not really intrinsic to the course, it mostly depends on how fast the state of CT processes people's documents. I have enjoyed the course so far; the class continues second semester, and you must take both semesters in order to get course credit!",
    "I know not everyone in class liked this course, but I loved it. It makes you think critically about problems with the way mental health is treated in this country. It can make you a little angry, upset, and motivated to change things. It has a great reading list too. Just be prepared to roll with the assignment due dates; you won't know them more than a week or two in advance, so plan accordingly when you're doing your work. Also, the fieldwork is very rewarding if you can get some more one-to-one contact. If you feel comfortable with it, go for a group home placement of you can.",
    "Wonderful class, the field placement is the best part though. Take it even if you are not a psych major, but keep in mind this is a year long commitment.",
    "This is a fun course overall. it depends what kind of placement you get put in and that can greatly affect the overall experience. Lectures can be long and a bit repetitive sometimes but only meets once a week. quite a bit of writingProfessor Lockhart is great.",
    "The first half of a year-long practicum course where each student is placed at a mental health-related institution somewhere in New Haven (Connecticut Mental Health Center, Fellowship Place, some school placements). It took a while for many of the placements to get started, so some people have only been a few times so far - kind of inevitable, but it's also not the most organized course in the world. Useful material in class and in the readings, and a great way to get a field placement if you're interested in getting to a glimpse of community mental health resources.",
    "PSYC 355 is a great course to introduce you to clinical psychology. The field placements can be really wonderful experiences and you get to learn so much from the people with which you work.",
    "I think every psychology major should be required to take a class in clinical psychology. This class has totally changed the way I understand psychotherapy, and I've learned more about issues in mental health care in this class than in any other.The placements are wonderful if you get one that you're passionate about, which honestly has proven a challenge for some. (Most people really seem to be enjoying& learning from the work they're doing, though.) The seminars can drag, because the information can seem basic\/intuitive in the way that a lot of psychological concepts seem at first, but I've found that I am a much better listener in all aspects of my life after having taken a semester of this class. Do it!"
