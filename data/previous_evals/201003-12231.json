    "You learn about African AND and AFAM history. This included all of the Americas where there were slaves of African descent. (West Indies and Brazil). It's really interesting, and fun. Just MAKE SURE YOU DO THE READING. Or, at least enough of it to answer the questions they give you each day.",
    "Very labor intensive for a humanities--quiz a week, midterm, a couple papers, final--but a lot of worthwhile information. Prof. Rugemer is clear with his expectations and willing to play ball.",
    "A great class with interesting subject material and good reading. I recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in the course material, take the class. You will learn things you did not know before, and there is room for interpretation and argument of the history we cover in the class.",
    "A solid introductory intro class in African American history that covers a period from slavery in the 1500s to Reconstruction."
