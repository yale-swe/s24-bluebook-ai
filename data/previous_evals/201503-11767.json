   "comments": [
    "Microeconomics is an important and worthwhile class to take, but the choice of this smaller class instead of the 115 lecture is a bigger decision than you might realize. The most important factor is the curve. Know that by choosing 110, you are sacrificing grades for the experience of the small-class environment.",
    "Take the lecture, it's easier, especially if you're taking DS and this is your first semester. This is a common situation, and if you are this person, take the lecture.",
    "If you have taken Econ in high school, feel free to take this course. If not, take the lecture.",
    "Introductory economics classes are always a good foundation to have. Learning intro micro in a seminar seemed to work for me, but it depends on the person. A smaller class means you're not lost in a sea of faces. Professor Simons takes advantage of this and allows for group problem solving within the class, which can make it quite enjoyable. Some of the material can be tricky and the class does keep a constant pace, so it is important to keep up.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110 to any student who wants a more theoretical look at introductory microeconomics as a opposed to a mathematical one. Math is definitely involved, but it seemed like Econ 115 delved more into the mathematical side while Econ 110 focused on the theory behind it and real world applications.",
    "Good course, perhaps consider taking the lecture rather than the seminar as the curve is a bit unforgiving.",
    "It isn't fun, but you have to take it for Econ.",
    "It's alright. It pretty much hit everything that my AP micro class (maybe a little less but more detail on most subjects) but also had a lot more calculations."
