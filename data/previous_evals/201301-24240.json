    "4 average. One week as low as 1, and probably 10 on the take-home midterm.",
    "In the beginning, more hours were spent because I hadn't really used SAS since September or October of 2012. There was a lot of material to be covered and new methods in SAS only briefly touched upon in Approaches to Data Management. Given that, I would average at least 10 hours if not more reviewing, preparing, and understanding the material and running code.",

   "comments": [
    "I wish I could have taken this one in the first year. The contents are very applied and useful. It would be very helpful if we learned that at the first year and use those methods in the second year.",
    "The course was absolutely wonderful, especially considering that this was its first semester.The topics went above and beyond what is normally taught in epi\/biostats courses, providing students with a much better understanding of propensity scores, path analysis, mediation modeling, PCA\/FA, and cluster analysis.The workload was high at the beginning, but Dr. Shebl ironed this issue out very quickly.",
    "I learned a lot and very glad I took this course because I learned a lot of applied statistical techniques that I have always wanted to learn. The workload was a lot but I didn't mind because there was no busy work; I felt that all of our homework really aided in my understanding of the topics, and less work would have resulted in less learning. My only complaint is that some of the instructions on the labs were vague and I was unsure of how to present my findings. Since we did not get much feedback until after the midterm, I did not know how the professor wanted me to format the homework.",
    "The useful curriculum is a strength of this course. The advanced topics I learned about were very applicable. There were multiple methods that I would have liked to apply to my thesis, had I taken the class during my first year (this not possible, as you first need a solid background in SAS and basic biostatistics to take this course). One suggestion is to include a session on using the SAS manual. In my first year, I never really learned how to navigate the SAS manual, so I have a hard time generating code on my own. A lecture not on how to USE SAS, but on how to LEARN AND APPLY NEW THINGS in SAS, would help make us more self-sufficient learners after the class ended.",
    "I thought the course was great. There really was an application to all the topics covered in class and Fatma put a great deal of work into the course and the codes used for homework assignments. This class covered a broad range of topics that are useful in public health without going too in depth. There were many topics and I although there was overlap with other courses, I would have liked a class on longitudinal analysis.As it was the first year, it wasn't as organized as it should be. Although I appreciated that the due date of the homeworks was at midnight 1 week from the assignment, it might be more effective if the assignments were due the night before so that we can focus on the new material for the new labs. Since this was the first year, it is understandable, but I think for future years, it would be great to have theassignment before hand to read over and prepare.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this class. I believe that it was one of the most applicable skills course offered at YSPH. The class was very useful as we learned various methods of analyses that could be considered for different epidemiology study designs.",
    "This course filled many of the gaps in my education of advanced analytic methods, and I am confident that the knowledge and skills I gained will be valuable as I pursue my own research. Labs complimented lectures, and lectures were well structured. The professor began by briefly covering the history and theories, which laid the foundation for each analytic method we studied. Labs reinforced using SAS to conduct analyses and interpreting results in the context of a well chosen data set and research question. A few of the early labs were longer than they needed to be, covering 3 or 4 methods when 1 or 2 may have been sufficient, and a couple of the later labs were a little short. Overall, the course was a great and needed addition to CDE course offerings."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Very good. She has done well. Very responsible and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is hard-working, dedicated, and incredibly responsive to her students. She constantly re-worked the course to fit the needs of the students, including altering the workload and making changes to SAS code and lecture notes.Dr. Shebl is also a gifted instructor. Her lectures are clear, understandable, and even fun. She is an all-around good person who treats students with respect.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl is extremely knowledgeable about how to use SAS in order to apply these methods. Since some of these techniques are not commands written into SAS but she was able to help us find MACROs that were able to help us conduct the analysis. She was also very patient and helpful when we had questions.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl was organized, well prepared, and very sensitive to our learning process. You can tell she puts a lot of thought, time and effort into preparing her lectures and her labs. Her slides are also well organized. She always showed concern for whether we were finding the curriculum useful, and whether we found the workload to be reasonable. When she received feedback that most of us were overwhelmed with the lab work, she immediately responded by reducing the load. She also solicited feedback about what topics we were interested in learning. She has very advanced knowledge of SAS and analytic methodology, and she is able to simplify her explanations so that we can understand.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Fatma- truly has a range of knowledge in advanced statistical methods using SAS. I enjoy her passion and her ability to relate the highly dense theoretical statistical methods in a way that makes sense.She was always willing to clarify her comments and questions assigned, however I felt that she should be more consistent with her wording on the assignments and provide more specifics or have guidelines for interpretation and guidelines for the homework assignments.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Given that this course is new and is being offered for the first time this year, I felt that the instructor did a great job preparing the class lecture information as well as articles that were relevant to the materials discussed. The instructor was accessible and she readily responded to my emails in a timely manner.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is an excellent teacher. It was evident that she took great care in preparing the lectures and labs, and the knowledge and experience she brought to the course were invaluable. She provided thoughtful feedback to students and clearly communicated course expectations, deadlines etc. She encouraged open discourse and feedback throughout the semester. Her student-centric approach and willingness to adapt materiel to students' research interests were greatly appreciated."

    "Instructor: Samantha Acson Streicher \u00a0Samantha is always a great TA. In fact, when deciding on which courses to choose, many students actively seek out courses which are TA'd by Samantha.Like Dr. Shebl, she is responsive to emails and is always willing to help her students. She deserves recognition for her hard work and for choosing to TA difficult courses.",
    "Instructor: Samantha Acson Streicher \u00a0The TA was helpful in answering questions in lab and provided good feedback on homework. It sometimes took her a while to grade our homework, but this was understandable this class required more than the average amount of work for a TA.",
    "Instructor: Samantha Acson Streicher \u00a0Samantha Streicher was helpful, patient, knowledgeable, and responsive to my questions. She was a great counterpart to the course instructor.",
    "Instructor: Samantha Acson Streicher \u00a0Sam was great at responding to questions and helping through the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Samantha Acson Streicher \u00a0The TA was readily accessible and responded to my emails in a timely manner. She was good at relaying the questions that I had, and that she couldn't answer, to the professor so that the professor could address them.",
    "Instructor: Samantha Acson Streicher \u00a0Sam provided helpful feedback on assignments. It was clear that she took the time to carefully review the material and the submissions. She and Dr. Shebl appeared to work very well together and adapted the labs throughout the semester to reflect student feedback. Overall, she did a fantastic job!"

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend! All popular methods you would see in published articles.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for all Epi and Biostats students at YSPH. It discusses several methods which aren't even mentioned in most other courses, but which are useful in the field. Dr. Shebl's lectures are fun and easy to follow. This class requires hard work (especially because you don't want to let Dr. Shebl down after seeing how many sleepless nights she puts into the course), but it is always worth the effort.",
    "This was a great course that focused on analytic methods commonly seen in public health research but not taught in traditional applied epidemiology classes. I've seen many of the topics covered in this class in journal articles before, but have never learned them before despite having taken many biostatistics classes. This course was especially helpful for those interested in socio-behavioral research as it Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Factor Analysis, and Structural Equation Modeling. I would highly suggest this class to PhD students who are interested in behavioral health or MPH students interested in research. I would not recommend this class to MPH students who do not intend to go into research as this class is a lot of work and most of these techniques are not used by applied epidemiologists.",
    "The course covers very useful theory and methodology that extends your knowledge to a more advanced level from the core biostatistics and epidemiology curriculum. The instructor is knowledgeable, gives organized and clear lectures, and is sensitive to her students' learning process. I would highly recommend it, as I have come away with a more advanced knowledge of analytic methods and a greater level of comfort with SAS.",
    "This course has a lot of work but you WILL use SAS and learn techniques that were only known in theory. I learned more coding and SAS from this and my thesis than I did from the introductory course in Approaches to Data Management. The application of statistical methods and SAS I feel will be useful in the future. I know it will improve after working out all the kinks in the structure of the course. I would recommend this course but recommend not taking another computer lab course because this will take up a good portion of time. You will not learn all these topics in depth, but it does give you a breadth of the various topics to approach answering a question from a given dataset.",
    "I believe that this class is very useful, as it allowed me to be exposed to various analyses that could be applied, accordingly, to a given epidemiology study design. If students are looking to acquire public health\/SAS\/analytical methods knowledge and skills, this course would be helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommended this course to all PhD students in epidemiology. This course provides the tools to conduct advanced analyses and to understand a large body of published research, which without a working knowledge of the methods is often difficult to fully appreciate."
