    "It depends on the topic of the lecture.",
    "I like the way that we can have all EHS students to share our ideas and have a chance to know each other. But I think the topics are too narrow and they all focused on toxicology. I think maybe we could choose our own topic that we are really interested in and it could make our seminar more interesting and helpful.",
    "Students should suggest topics\/speakers at the beginning of the year to generate more widespread interest.",
    "The papers were great, but discussion was often hard to stimulate.",
    "good to learn latest information in EHS",
    "Great",
    "I believe that this is a good course. However, I am dismayed by the amount of apathy displayed by other students. This course is supposed to be a discussion and it is tough for this to properly happen when no one talks. Other than that, good course.",
    "not pretty good to all the EHS students. Each students have different area such like toxicology or exposure. Please let the students decide which seminar they would love to attend. It's not reasonable to set this course as required course.",
    "I understand why it is important to make this seminar mandatory for first year EHS students. However, I do not think it is fair to make it mandatory for second-year EHS students. I'm pretty sure this is the only department at YSPH that requires its second-year students to attend weekly seminars\/journal clubs. It should be optional for second-year students.",
