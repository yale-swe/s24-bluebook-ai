   "comments": [
    "An interesting class without too much burden by classwork which makes it much more enjoyable to simply come to lectures and learn interesting topics. I would suggest this class for those qualities.",
    "Yes. As stated above, this course provides an excellent overview. It also stresses learning ideas and writing, instead of busy work and memorization.",
    "It provides a good overview of inflammation and many diseases, which is great for a first year student still deciding which area to research. It also allows the students to meet several faculty in the pathology department. The day to day work load is generally light, but the take home tests\/final paper require a lot of time, research, and critical thinking. This class allows students to improve their writing and research skills, as opposed to other classes that focus on memorizing material.",
    "I would like to recommend this course to other students.This lecture is very helpful to set a concept how disease occurs.In addition, this is a good lecture to learn basic knowledge about current challenging diseases.",
    "Yes, this is a very informative class covering a lot of current prevailing diseases, I feel this is really important for students in M2P2 track.",
    "Path 690 is course which covers a broad range of topics on mechanisms of disease, the focus ranges between infectious diseases to autoimmunity and is taught by experts in the field. I would wholeheartedly recommend the course to a fellow student.",
    "Great survey class, a few lectures may not be as exciting, but overall entertaining and informative. I would absolutely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Yes, I will recommend it since it can help us learn much about pathology, especially helpful for first-year students.",
    "I recommend that other students take this class as it discusses some interesting issues that might have come up in other classes, but in the context of disease. The main focus is on understanding how normal processes are perturbed in the disease etiology and what treatments exist to overcome these problems. It is a different way to approach biochemistry and cell biology (as well as physiology) and a very translational way to train yourself to think.",
    "A series of lectures each on a different human disease. Each disease is presented by a different lecturer, adding variety in presentation of the material. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would describe it as an interesting course worth taking if pathology is of interest. Would also helpful to have an immunology background.",
    "I would recommend to someone who is interected in learning the basics of disease pathology.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I will definitely recommend this class because students can learn a various aspects of human physiology in one class."

   "comments": [
    "I did not have much knowledge of pathology, so this course exponentially increased my knowledge of this topic and the diseases included.",
    "My research will likely be on topics involving the molecular mechanisms leading to inflammation, therefore the first section of the course was very useful to learn ideas about this topic on an organism-wide level. That being said, a few of the lectures were too clinical. It almost seemed like the PI's teaching these sections forgot that we are not in medical school.",
    "This course provided me with a good overview of many diseases and disease processes. It was very interesting to see connections between the disease processes of different diseases, for instance how inflammation is usually involved. Because I am a first year student, this course was really great in that it exposed me to several fields before I have to make a choice as to what I want to work on for my own PhD.",
    "This lecture was valuable to me because I could learned about disease related immune response by focusing on disease itself. For this reason, I got a chance tothink about the interaction between immune cells and other human cells such as epithelial cells and fibroblast. It has broaden my view on immunobiology.",
    "I gained a broader view of diseases, the teaching format is very good in that they are lectures with each disease at one time. I think getting to know the disease as well as getting to know people working in this field is very helpful.",
    "This course gave be a broader understanding of disease mechanisms and the different routes through which a disease can develop. I very much appreciated the immunological input of each lecturer, as I am in the Immunology Department myself.",
    "This course served as an excellent review for basic biochemical and biological pathways and how they relate to disease, while also presenting new research on these topics by some of the leading investigators in the respective fields.",
    "Lectures give us topics in different fields and the discussion session, homework and final paper make us read many papers, which help us learn muchabout a certain field, its recent findings and its research methods.",
    "The class was itself very interesting, however it did not contribute too much to my dissertation work. The fact that it trains you to think about disease etiology and how normal molecular and physiological processes are imbalanced does help you overall to apply your mind, however, beyond this the class did not add more to my actual dissertation work.",
    "To some extent,",
    "It broadened my perspective of studying human diseases."
