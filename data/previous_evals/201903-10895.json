   "comments": [
    "This course is difficult because it covers considerable material in a short period of time. There is not a lot of room to explore the ideas behind and applications of the mathematics skills we develop. I walked away from the class feeling like I could answer problems put in front of me, but without a strong sense of what physical claims I was making. I would separate the Classical and Statistical portions of the class into two separate semesters.",
    "Strengths: very accessible and engaged professor and teaching fellow Weaknesses: material was not always presented in the most understandable manner. Problem sets did not always follow what we were learning in class.",
    "Strength of course was that sufficient practice was given, so felt prepared for exams. Weakness is more advanced concepts and applications were not touched upon.",
    "Strengths: The strengths of this course was that it covered a wide variety of topics and required us to work problems from each topic. The recitation sections were incredibly helpful. I felt like Rodrigo helped clarify and solidify the material. Rodrigo did an excellent job of identifying students' weaknesses in the material and helped to overcome those weaknesses. Weaknesses: At the beginning of the course the problem sets sometimes felt cumbersome and repetitive. However, after mid-semester feedback Dr. Lowenberg adjusted the course and it became a lot more manageable. Another weakness of the course was that it often felt like there was a disconnect between what was covered during lecture and what was expected on the problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for those who are required to take it, because it felt like a very fair and reasonable pace compared to what I have heard about other Thermodynamics courses.",
    "Yes and no. I loved having Michael as a professor and Rodrigo as a teaching fellow, but I cannot confidently say that I really understand thermodynamics after taking this class.",
    "Yes, would recommend if thermodynamics knowledge is necessary.",
    "Yes, this is a good low level graduate course that grants the student with a basic level of classical and statistical thermodynamics."
