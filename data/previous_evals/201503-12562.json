    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone looking to fulfill a sociology credit given they are interested in technology to some degree (no technical background necessary).",
    "This class is not for everyone, and the first week might seem very dry. However, if you stick through, it can be a very unique and interesting experience. Dr. Boorman is extremely knowledgeable in the field, with contributions you learn about in the class. Low workload, you can get away with skimping on the reading, but a lot was pretty interesting so I did it when I could. You do not need a technical background for the class, but the class still is mostly cs people. Dr. Boorman's lecture style is unique, though it may seem very dry to some. I would definitely recommend talking to him once in a while if you take the class."
