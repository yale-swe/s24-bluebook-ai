    "If you want to learn about the Mongols and Caucasus people - take this course!",
    "An incredibly taught course with a great professor that covers quite a bit of information in an in-depth and manageable way. With that being said, this is not an Intro to Russian History and to have meaningful conversation in the course, I highly recommend coming in with a solid background knowledge, else getting cut out or plain left behind in conversation is bound to happen. This can be remedied through doing thorough and complete readings on the weekly basis that it requires, however, unless you prioritize this class this can be hard to do. Basically come in ready to work and know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "Definitely a different style from usual history courses in that it's very fact and source based rather than driven by an argument for the entire course. I really liked this method as I felt I learned more. Prof Bushkovitch is very intelligent and will question you if you make badly justified responses.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Russian or Asian history even remotely.",
    "Russia and the Steppe was a fun and challenging class that comprehensively covered a large swath of history while forcing the student to understand the motivations and larger factors that contributed to it."
