    "Physics 205l is a fairly standard introductory lab course. Most if not all of those who take 205l do so because it is required for their major, whether Physics or a related field. Many of the experiments were similar to those I had done in my high school lab, but 205 does a decent job of teaching the basics of error analysis and how to use an oscilloscope and related equipment. The workload is not heavy - a brief quiz based on lab handouts and a two-page summary report per week.",
    "This lab is...fine. If you have to take it for the physics major, worry not--it's easy and not very work intensive. Some of the labs are fun if you approach them with the right attitude. The experimental guides haven't been significantly updated for many years now, and they're poorly written. Hopefully they'll re-write them--that could make this class much better. All in all, a busy work that can be fun it you don't take it too seriously.",
    "Don't take 165, take this.",
    "If you're taking this is probably because you want to be a physics major. The course is easy. Although the labs are not the most exciting thing in the world, I think they give you a lot of practice with very important equipment. For example, I am working in a lab this summer and I already know how to use a oscilloscope, frequency generator, and some other devices with long names because of this lab. The labs in here, although sometimes trivial, are teaching your about practical devices that you may use in a lab.",
    "too much work for a half credit, like many labs at Yale",
    "I don't think anyone goes into 205 Lab thinking, \"This will be very fun and intellectually engaging!!\" but also, hey, it's not really that difficult or time-consuming either. You'll get familiar with the way experimentation works, albeit with generally very simple, contrived experiments, and you'll learn how to use equipment. Oh boy!",
    "Most students taking PHYS 205L have it as a requirement for their major. If you do not plan to do physics research, I would not particularly recommend this course, but if you do, then the skills it teaches are useful.",
    "Physics lab is different from other lab classes because youre not reinforcing material you learned in class, but rather learning techniques for data analysis and error propagation, which in my opinion was much more helpful especially if you havent taken statistics before. The labs were a lot of fun, and the final was not difficult at all! If youre thinking about taking lab, you probably have to for your major, but rest assured that its much less work than other lab classes -- lab reports here are capped at two pages, and you pretty much never spend more than three hours in lab.",
    "PHYS 205L 01 is an advanced laboratory course for physical measurement. The course offers weekly labs bolstered by extensive packets of material. The topics can be quite expansive however, with the experiments that are provided every student is sure to leave with a solid understanding of the relevant measurements, physics equations, and uncertainties. Although the class provides a great amount of support, the professor and teaching assistants encourage the students to think constantly for themselves, especially in the form of questions and perusal. The course should provide the student a lot of confidence for analyzing physical phenomena.",
    "PHYS 205L is a great class for anybody considering a physics major who has not previously worked in a laboratory setting. The work is reasonable and useful and you learn valuable skills such as how to use lab equipment and how to keep a good lab notebook. My one caveat is I'm not sure how useful it is to those who have done advanced labs before.",
    "If you're taking this course, that probably means that it is a prerequisite for another course, so just be glad that this is a physics lab and not a chemistry lab. It's not that difficult, it's not a ton of work, and although it can be a little bit boring at times, it's mostly a good time. I overall enjoyed this course, although the concepts are a little elementary in comparison to the physics lecture courses, but it serves as a good introduction to PHYS 206L, which apparently has more in the means of good content, but also doles out more work.",
    "It is a class that you probably have to take. While the class starts out slow, the later labs are much more interesting to do.",
    "PHYS205 is a basic physics lab course that is much more focused on error analysis than the actual physics. It can get rather boring, but it does help you understand these concepts much better, and it greatly improves your data analysis skills.",
    "Usually fun and interesting lab class that gives you some real-world experience with the concepts that you would examine in your physics class. Data analysis is pretty important so I recommend this lab over the 165L but there's not too much of a difference from what I can tell.",
    "This is the first term of introductory physics lab; you just gotta do it. It really is not hard or time consuming. You do most of the lab in the 3 hours (most people finished early every time) then you have to type a short summary. Not much work at all. Just get through it to go on to 206.",
    "A class with an enormous workload but the resources there to help you. The workload was bigger than most of my full credit courses.",
    "Boring but necessary lab, not a huge amount of work.",
    "It's not too difficult and doesn't take up much time. However, most of the labs aren't super interesting and don't relate to what you're doing in lecture. Some of the labs can be fun though or introduce you to topics you may haven't seen before. Basically, take this class if you have to for your major or if your considering a physics major."
