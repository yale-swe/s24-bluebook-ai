   "comments": [
    "Starts with the fundamentals of PET technology and ligand-receptor kinetics and works progressively through the development of the field of PET brain imaging. The class critically analyzes literature and has in depth discussions about the methods and findings.",
    "Imaging drugs in the brain is everything you need to know about PET imaging that would allow you to design your own studies using PET. I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "This course is a comprehensive overview of how to design PET studies and analyze the resulting data. This is taught in the context of designing studies that test the response mostly of the dopimanergic system to the drugs nicotine and alcohol, using various past studies to exemplify positives and negatives of study design. The work load is light compared to how much you gain in understanding through the class, so it is a big bang for your buck, and I would recommend others take this class.",
    "Would recommend. Informative and lively discussion-based class centeredon PET imaging of addiction.",
    "A fun, useful introduction to using PET to solve your neuro-drug problems.",
    "If you want to gain knowledge of canonical as well as modern PET literature, this is for you."

   "comments": [
    "This course will help me critically read and understand the experimental design of PET findings. This course will help me understand the clinical aspects of my dissertation research, and the translational significance of my research.",
    "Although I know know a great deal about PET, I do not personally work on PET studies, this this class did not add a great deal to topics directly relevant to my work. Some of the information regarding nicotine and smoking was relevant to my own work, but overall this class did not advance my dissertation-research-relevant knowledge much.",
    "Great foundation in PET imaging of the brain. Filled in some PET holes that needed to be filled in.",
    "Very important in familiarizing me with past and current PET literature."
