   "comments": [
    "This was a required class I did not initially want to take but looking back I enjoyed many of the readings and came away with a good introductory understanding of many African music traditions and genres. There are four very manageable tests throughout the semester then a large 10-15 page final paper. It wasn't the best class I've taken but even if you don't know anything about African music, I think you can find something useful you can take away from class.",
    "A fairly in depth look at a variety of African musical traditions. Fantastic course, I learned a ton, and was exposed to some great music.",
    "I would recommend it. You have to take it if you want to be a music major, but it is also a very interesting course.",
    "This course is how music majors learn the importance and application of ethnomusicology. It challenges students to think outside the boundaries of Western art music by considering African traditional, neotraditional, popular, and art music. You should take this class.",
    "Music 353 is a survey of sub-saharan African music, though the specific focus of the course evidently will now change from year to year, so it may not focus on sub-saharan Africa for quite some time. The course focuses much more on anthropological context-setting for the music in question than on actual discussion and analysis of the music, which I personally found endlessly frustrating. If you are not a music major, I would only recommend this course if you have a strong interest in the anthropology of music in a foreign culture.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend it if you're not a music major. If you are it's not so bad. Go into it with an open mind and you will learn a lot about the relationship between music and social currents\/social structures. This semester we spent the entire semester on subsaharan Africa but I think in the future other regions will be covered.",
    "Interesting class. Take it!",
    "A cultural, musical, and sociological study of music in various African cultures.",
    "Yes. I think the focus on African music rather than non-western music in general allowed us to get into some depth in what was still a broad survey.",
    "Music 353 was an interesting course, and I definitely learned a lot about West African and South African music. However, I found the structure of the class a little confusing. I often found the language used in the class to be unnecessarily flowery\/academic, which made it much more difficult to understand exactly what points we were supposed to be gleaning from the discussion. Be prepared to learn a lot, but maybe to be slightly frustrated.",
    "If you loooooove learning about an alien and unfamiliar music culture and then discovering that it greatly informs our understanding of global sociopolitical movements as well as our own music, then you'll looooove this class. Seriously, it's great. Veal is awesome.",
    "If Veal is teaching it and it's still on Sub-Saharan Africa, DO IT it's so interesting! And a kind of music you would possibly never hear otherwise.",
    "Being one of the few people who took the course as a non-music-major, I ended up really enjoying it but struggled a little with the more technical aspects. The readings could be a little too long with details that didn't really pertain to what we were studying, but some of them were really interesting, especially when I had some background on the music or area already. I would recommend doing some reading beforehand, especially on senegalese, malian, and nigerian history and geography listening to some of the drum music before taking the course just so you have a bit of background and aren't completely lost when Michael Veal plunges into things. But its a really fascinating perspective on how music and other aspects of the world interact.",
    "Absolutely not. The course was disorganized in the following frustrating ways: 1) The readings were far too specific, sometimes incomprehensible and poorly written, and were not tailored to supplement class discussion well. For example, some of the assigned articles were incredibly long and only tangentially related to the musical styles we were learning about. 2) The course focused on very specific cultures and musical styles without giving enough of an overview of the history for students to be able to put the material discussed in class in context. Huge portions of African history were left to the TAs to teach in section, without any textbook readings to provide basic information. 3) Lectures were badly organized - we would often spend too much time discussing some philosophical question on the nature of music or colonialism and then rush through all of the information planned for that lecture in the last half-hour.That being said, part of the reason I disliked this course so much was that I had to take it, even though I am not particularly interested in the music of specific African cultures. So, if you are really interested in learning about music from different African countries, you might be willing to put up with the disorganized lectures and readings and get a lot out of the course."
