    "Every seminar has an intellectually challenging discussion. The final paper is quite a bit of work (although there are no other assignments), but very rewarding. I think this is one of the only true seminars (read not lectures pretending to be seminars) in the Economics department, and is very well taught. Hidden gem in economics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it! But shop it just so that you know whether the teaching style is a good fit for you.",
    "DO IT TAKE IT! This course was amazing it was super chill and had no required reading or psets, the one requirement was a final original research paper which really challenges you in a good way and allows you to do some actual empirical analysis. Class was always enjoyable and a learned a ton about thinking through math and models. The fact that there were no psets or tests really made it way more enjoyable to learn and think through all the math problems."
