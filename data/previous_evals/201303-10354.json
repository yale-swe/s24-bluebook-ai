    "Yes I would. Even if it were not mandatory, it would still be a good guide to writing thesis.",
    "Structure of the class probably varies with the Religious Studies DUS, but this year, Professor Lofton was great, treating us to pizza while we discussed the progress of our senior year. There isn't too much required writing over the semester, but a lot of thinking through thesis ideas. It helps to bounce ideas off your fellow majors, but I feel like the main purpose of the class was to keep people accountable.",
