   "comments": [
    "Yep! It was great to draw twice a week: the whole class improved a bunch! It was great to see the progress. My section was not stressful, but I heard it really depends on your section\/teacher.",
    "YES very fun even if you don't have any experience in art, like me.",
    "Take it, 10\/10 class.",
    "ART 114 with Rob Storr is FANTASTIC! Very little work outside the classroom, but each two hour class session was such a wonderful reprieve from the everyday Yale craziness. I basically had never drawn before, and I feel like I gained so much knowledge about the artistic gaze and just how to look at an object. We drew mostly from nude models, with a combination of charcoal and ink paint. Highly recommend!!",
    "Not a must take but was a fun class to have senior spring.",
    "An introduction to drawing, not as a class on technique, but as an exploration of your abilities in different mediums.",
    "Great introduction to sketching, figure drawing, and basic paintwork",
    "I would definitely recommend ART 114 to another student in any year at Yale. It is a great fifth class and very enjoyable.",
    "Take this course with Rob! I took this my senior year, and it changed my life!",
    "The course was a phenomenal introduction to the art world. Having never invested time in my artistic ability prior to this course, there were many classes I left feeling frustrated with my own skill level and ability, but attending the critique at the end of the semester made me realize the leaps of improvement I made during the course of the semester. 10\/10 would recommend taking the course if it's possible.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can! It's such a breath of fresh air from the rest of Yale.",
    "Basic Drawing is a relaxed, enjoyable class. I loved having the time to dedicate several hours a week to learning how to draw--a skill I never even attempted to cultivate until now. Prof. Storr obviously has a wealth of knowledge, which he shares casually throughout the class, but I do wish he provided a little more structure and clarity in the course. He walked around the room and provided tips and opinions while we were drawing, and he also called the group to circle around him while he explained some brilliant bit of art historical or technical insight, but be warned that there is no syllabus nor any written communication at all. You have to keep a sketchbook but you are not told what to do with it or what the expectations are (you don't have to turn it in till the end of the year, though, which may be a draw if your goal is to not have any homework!). This freedom and casual vibe is probably wonderful for students with some drawing experience, but those totally new to drawing may feel lost and unsure of what to do or how to improve. Content-wise, the class focuses on pattern- and figure-drawing, both of which can be really fun. Know that you don't get many technical tips. Just by showing up to class and dedicating four hours a week to drawing, you'll improve as an artist, so don't feel scared off or like it'll be a waste of your time, but if you're looking for real guidance and feedback, this class may not be exactly right."
