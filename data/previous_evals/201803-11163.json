   "comments": [
    "This was honestly not a great course. Expectations were never clear, problem sets were incredibly confusing, and neither the teaching fellow nor the professor were ever helpful in the slightest. Definitely could be made more conducive to student learning",
    "This course is engaging when conceptual, but the computational side of the course involves tedious proofs.",
    "This course was poorly organized and I felt that I didnt have the resources to do well. I wasnt sure what material we were supposed to be learning. We also didnt receive enough feedback; for example, we didnt receive graded problem sets in time to use them to study for exams.",
    "This course covers some really interesting topics, but I found Prof. Fedorov's lecturing lacking sometimes. Oftentimes he would just describe graphs on the or derive equations instead of spending more time on application and really physical concepts.",
    "The problem sets involved a lot of guessing in terms of what assumptions to make, what math we had to use. Would have been useful to have more office hours\/study hall in the day or two before the psets were due. (Sometimes the office hours would be right after they were due.) The second half of the course was based in printed notes that detailed a lot of complicated derivations. It would have been helpful to focus less on the derivations and more on the implications of the results. I did not think I had a good understanding of the physical meaning of the results because we did not talk about them enough to begin to understand (particularly about topics like potential vorticity). Also, a problem set required Matlab even though it was not a prerequisite."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; it is a great way to learn a lot of the climate without knowing where some derivations come from.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are required to take it for some reason. It's extremely hard to learn anything with a professor and teaching fellow as unhelpful as these two were.",
    "This course seems to only be accessible for G&G majors, and some physics or applied math majors. If that is the case, I recommend taking this course as an elective.",
    "No, the material was interesting but the course was not well organized.",
    "I would recommend this course if someone's really interested in the subject, but overall the class was only okay.",
    "If you want to learn in a very detailed way about the physics of climate, then yes."
