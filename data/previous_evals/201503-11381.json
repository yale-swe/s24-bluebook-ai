   "comments": [
    "I doubt you have the option NOT to take this course (chem major, premed, etc), but I would recommend electing to take it in a term when Spiegel is NOT teaching, and hopefully only ONE professor is... assuming that will make it smoother...",
    "The only reason you are probably taking this class is because you are pre-med or a chem major. It's not a great class, but organic chemistry definitely has a bad rep and this class is not terrible by any means. Utilize office hours and your peers.",
    "If you are really interested in organic chemistry and reactions that are important in biology, you will have the willpower to get through this class. However, if Spiegel and Herzon are teaching the class, prepare for a semester of frustration, self-teaching, and really low test averages.",
    "I would never ever recommend this course to another student. If you are a pre-medI am sorry but you have to take it. All I have to say is that I was a pre-med going into this course and now I am definitely not anymore. It was pure misery please only take it if you have to.",
    "CHEM 221 is a very, very difficult course. The strengths include the availability of peer tutors and TAs. The weaknesses are that the problem sets and midterms are just too difficult. There is a big jump in comprehension from what we learn in class to what we are tested on. Also, the problem sets always involved material we had not learned until the day it was supposed to be turned in. Some people are unable to understand this material on their own, so it would be in the class' best interest to be taught the material first before giving out the problem set. Also, the midterms did not reflect the difficulty of the problem sets. They were much harder than they should have been. An average in the 40s with the highest score being in the 60s is nothing really to brag out. This entire course needs to be revamped. CHEM 221 is NOT recommended. DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU DON'T NEED TO. If you're pre-med, get all the help you can get by going to TAs and peer tutors. The textbook will not always help you, especially since CHEM 221 focuses more on chemical literature and research content than the material in the textbook. If you enjoy chemistry and feel you would do well in this course, then go ahead. I do not want to stop anyone from taking a course they will do well in. But please keep in mind that this course is very, very difficult and you must have the time (about 20 hours a week or more) to dedicate to this class in order for you to do well.",
    "Spiegel is a good lecturer, but thats about all hes good at. Dont bother trying to ask him questions after class or going to office hours. Hes so disconnected from his students and TAs that it seems like he doesnt make any effort to understand what students do or dont know. This resulted in psets, practice tests, and even test questions that involved material that wasnt covered in class and that he assumed we would be able to get. He can also be condescending toward students that ask him questions, so I'm not really sure why he's a professor. However, his grading is fair and everyone leaves the class feeling like they learned a lot. My best advice is to find a good TA for questions and form a study group to get through the class together. Good luck.",
    "If you really didn't enjoy CHEM 220, still give 221 a chance. I was unsure if I wanted to continue with my chemistry major after 220, but the material in this course is so much more interesting than the first semester. Primarily, you work with mechanisms, which I found to be super cool and intuitive. Herzon and Spiegel are both excellent professors, and they co-taught the class very effectively. Tests are hard and low scores are common, but the class is curved generously (50% A\/A-, 50% B\/B+) so as long as you're in the middle of the pack you'll do okay. Manageable workload, and once you understand how mechanisms work, there's very little memorization.",
    "SYNTHESIS If you don't have to take it, don't. It's mostly the subject material that's hard to keep up with. If you do have to take it, though, don't fall into the lie of knowing the mechanism. I spent all semester trying to learn the mechanisms and did awfully on every exam. Just memorize your reagents and you'll be fine.",
    "It's a lot of work. I don't think you should take it unless you really need to or you like organic chemistry.",
    "I really like the topic of organic chemistry, and both Herzon and Spiegel were great lecturers. The class never felt like it was dragging on. However, some of the problem sets were extremely long with questions taken from topics we hadn't yet covered, and the professors didn't make themselves very accessible.",
    "Much harder than CHEM 220 and not as well taught, unfortunately. If you are taking Orgo 2, you most likely don't have a choice in the matter. Basic tips for succeeding in the class: make friends with the TA or peer tutor, have a good eraser, and pay attention to both the class and the textbook. You will not be completely prepared for the tests ever, so get used to a curve system. The style of the class also shifts with the professors, so be prepared. Psets can take a while, so start early and prepare to read ahead for some of them.",
    "Take it if you have to. You'll learn organic chemistry.",
    "CHEM 221 is a challenging but ultimately rewarding course. The material is presented clearly and concisely, and the professors do their best to make the lectures interesting. The problem sets are difficult, but for the most part not overly so, and the exams are fair.",
    "This course is thorough and comprehensive. Warning: problem sets were excessively long and test difficulty varied.",
    "Don't take unless you need to. Since the class had two teachers instead of one, class felt very unstructured. The arrangement forced students to adapt to two different teachings styles and course expectations. The first half with Spiegel was great. A healthy balance of synthesis and mechanisms with a few entertaining stories in lecture to get students through the material. The second half with Herzon was frustrating. Herzon doesn't really teach--he just rushes through problem answers and expects you to understand everything perfectly. Learning from Herzon was like trying to drink from a high-pressure fire hydrant, you can take in some things but most of it goes right past you and in the end, you are a sad, soaked mess.",
    "Definitely hard, but manageable if you put in the time and effort. Do the readings before class, go to office hours, pay attention in class, tackle the psets earlier rather than later, and devote time outside of class to committing the material to memory and you should be good. Harder than Orgo I and a lot more reactions to learn, but Spiegel and Herzon are good, engaging professors and succeed in making the material very interesting.",
    "Orgo was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Orgo II material was much more interesting than Orgo I since you get to play around with more reactions and mechanisms. I also found that I studied much less for Orgo II than I did for Orgo I because you know how to study Orgo now. I would highly encourage other students because Orgo challenges you to think creatively. It also is a beautiful subject that shows the wonders of this universe.",
    "This course was disorganized, and it made learning a tough subject even tougher. The problem sets included material that had not been covered yet, either in lectures or in the reading. The lecturers were fine, but the constant switching between different professors made it difficult to get used to a teaching style and learn effectively. The exams were too difficult to effectively test our knowledge. I was frustrated by the course.",
    "It's like drinking through a fire hose that has a funnel nozzle so it comes out even faster.",
    "Good content. Worthwhile challenges. Poor professors. Pathetic teaching philosophy. Pathetic TAs. If you're a pre-med, the random vagaries of this course's academics and grading might deter you. I would recommend Professor Ellman's Organic Chemistry (now sophomore Organic Chemistry\/CHEM220-221\/this course) instead. He is more logical and rigorous with his academic standards and grading. However, if you want to challenge yourself and really appreciate principles and intuition behind reaction mechanisms and organic chemistry beyond what the book already tells you, take the one with Spiegel and Herzon.",
    "This class has its rough parts (lengthy psets and exams that induce emotional highs and lows), but overall it is a worthwhile class with a pretty large curve of As and A-s. Almost everything in the class is definitely pre-med. I took it as a tentative pre-med, and the course itself did not convince me one way or the other. If youre on top of your psets and regularly go to class and try, you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend the class but warn the student that there is a lot of reading and independent work to do outside of class.",
    "Not so bad after the first half of organic. Just do the reading, go to class, and work your butt off.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you need to. I found it interesting, even if the tests were hard and oftentimes I didn't know how I did on them until I got them back.",
    "A mandatory class if you are premed, second semester organic chemistry is definitely a lot more challenging than the first semester. Everything builds on itself, and if you are on top of your material earlier on, you will thank yourself later. Make flashcards as you go along! In regards to professors, it is challenging in general when there are two professors who co-teach, as sometimes the switch in material is not fluid and it is difficult to understand the expectations of both. However, I do want to note that Spiegel is a really great Professor who really cares about the well-being of his students, and his lectures are really pretty entertaining, especially given the subject matter.",
    "Orgo 2 is going to be a lot regardless--prepare yourself and study in advance and don't even think about falling behind and you too can survive",
    "If you're reading this it's too late. You're probably required to take orgo, so I'll spare you the details. After CHEM 221 I definitely feel like I have a solid understanding of organic chemistry, especially compared to a year ago, but the course structure does not make it easy. There was serious disconnect between the lectures and problem sets - which were ridiculously hard and often contained problems that we could not actually do without additional reactions from the TAs. So just know that you can't make it through this class alone, and you really need to form a study group or find people to work on psets with. Exams were hard too, but it was actually not difficult to follow along when learning material in class, the assessments just didn't match up.",
    "I would recommend it to students who find it required for their chem major or pre-med requirements. There are interesting things that we learn in the class, but not particularly applicable outside the discipline.",
    "This course, overall, was probably one of the most poorly-organized courses I have taken at Yale. I don't think that Organic Chemistry II is inherently like this; the material is interesting, and so I would recommend this course to another student, but definitely not with Professors Spiegel and Herzon. Professor Spiegel was manageable, but try to avoid taking it with Professor Herzon. The professors were not very receptive to the prior knowledge and needs of the students. Furthermore, there seemed to be a strong lack of communication between the professors, the TA grad students, and the students, which resulted in an unproductive and frustrating pattern in which the students voiced their concerns to the the TAs, who were not responsible for the issues and also mostly powerless to resolve them. This occurred frequently with problem set questions, because many of the questions we were assigned often required using techniques and reactions that we had never been taught, through some lack of foresight by the professors. This was the obvious weakness of the course. One strength of the course was the effective coupling of lecture with the textbook reading; both resources worked together well, and our professors made sure to note which parts of the textbook we should pay specific attention to and which parts we should disregard. Overall, I did learn a good deal of organic chemistry during this course, but I think that the ways in which we were assessed--namely, through psets and exams--were not tailored to what we had learned in lecture and the textbook, which was both frustrating and confusing.",
    "Terrible class. I know that Orgo II is a necessary evil for pre-meds, but if you can avoid taking it with these professors (especially Herzon), do so! The team-teaching made lectures inconsistent and p-sets ranged from taking 2 hours to complete to 4 hours a day for the entire Thanksgiving break. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.",
    "This class sucks. Try to understand the psets. Prepare to waste a lot of your time. The chem we learned wasn't actually relate to biological systems. The professors just talked about chemicals that were important to them. Would have appreciated if the chemistry were actually relevant to biological systems.",
    "I took orgo second semester because I felt that I needed to finish understanding the concepts I learned the first semester. Instead, this class was a huge disappointment. The questions they put on the psets and exams were not things they taught us until a week after we handed them in (you know this is true when people are getting 4-20% on their exams). Some problem sets were super long so you needed to start them a week early. Since they hadn't taught you half the stuff, the office hours the student tutors hold were helpful. On the other hand, the TA's were very smart but absolutely terrible at explaining things. Probably the worst course I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Overall, this class suffered a lack of consistency in difficulty and time. It seemed to start off too hard and then became too easy towards the end, and it never seemed to find that middle ground throughout the semester. With more experience the class could be taught very well, as the material was presented well. If you are pre-med or the class is required for your major, then I would recommend this class, but otherwise it isn't necessary.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. The material is pretty interesting, but there is little to no consistency semester by semester. Basically, you should expect to fight an uphill battle figuring out the structure of the class as well as learning the material.",
    "Worth it."
