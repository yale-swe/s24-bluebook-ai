   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course. I think a lot of students shy away from it because they hear the material is difficult and is sometimes abstract, but that is exactly the reason to take it.",
    "I would recommend the class to many students because it is rigorous and covers fascinating material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend PLSC 517 to other students interested in formal modeling or political economy.",
    "Highly recommend. Covers the material at a relatively high level while still being quite accessible.",
    "The course provides an overview of microeconomic methods relevant to formal models in political science, including an introduction to distribution, political competition, social welfare, and social choice theory. Highly recommended. These are important topics for political science, and Professor Roemer provides an invaluable perspective, as someone who has made major contributions to these areas. His critiques of dominant approaches (especially to political competition) are particularly helpful for prospective political scientists."

   "comments": [
    "I knew nothing about formal theory coming in, and now I am comfortable seeing it in papers and can (at least much better) understand what's going on with peoples' models. I don't know yet how important these concepts will be to my own research, but to the extent I do formal theory, I am sure it will be helpful there as well.",
    "I am not sure if this course will be helpful in my own dissertation or research as I am unsure whether I will be using formal theory in my own work. However, it will help me better understand the literature and the discipline.",
    "I learned a lot, and much of it will help me in devising future research projects."
