    "Prof Moon is wonderful. This is the only QR I've done at Yale that felt like it was a serious and interesting intellectual venture, and not some depressing exercise. Despite that, it's not actually that hard. Go for it",
    "Yes. An interesting QR. Not too difficult for non-math\/science people.",
    "Take it if you are interested in structural engineering, and can embrace math that is applied intuitively.",
    "Take it! Professor Moon is a lot of fun, though you'll have to get used to his accent. You'll learn a lot about how buildings stand up, and you'll do some fun calculations on diagrams. There is some calculus near the end, but you don't have to actually do calc; it's just conceptual background. The problem sets were super easy and the building projects were fun. Don't angst too much about the team projects! He gave us all perfect grades, with bonus points for the top designs.",
    "I'd recommend it if you are interested in Architecture and want to fulfill distribution requirements with a not very challenging class.",
    "A great introduction to structures and a fulfilling class. It's all statics so if you like math or physics it will be fun. Professor Moon has an awesome quirky sense of humor, so it's definitely worth shopping (his accent gets easier to understand over time). Definitely worthwhile even if you're not an architecture major. Wherever you go, you'll notice a lot more details about structures and how they work.",
    "YES",
    "Great class. If you've had physics before, the math and concepts will be very familiar, but this class will help you to build the intuition to examine structural concepts. Homeworks are weekly and very straightforward. Both exams are fair. The two competitions were cool, but a little time consuming, especially if you focus on working hard on them. MAke sure you are clear on the guidelines that he sets. really REALLY enjoyable class that isn't too stressful.",
    "It was a great venture into a field most of us are unfamiliar with- structural logicbehind how buildings stand. It was exhilarating. I couldn't recommend it more highly. Don't be scared by the quantitative and scientific aspect of it, AT ALL! Every single person in my 22-person class, including those who are very shaky with math, felt good about the class. Jump in.",
    "Fun course where you feel like you actually understand everything you learn. Moon is the most patient professor ever, and the course is not overwhelming at all. Great class to take for a science credit, psets are easy if you pay attention in class, exams are not designed to trip you up.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this. Easy, fun, engaging introduction to a scientific\/mathematical perspective that may otherwise be daunting\/too difficult.",
    "You should take this class - I highly recommend it. Even though I'm not an architecture major, it was really fascinating to learn how the structures around us are all put together. The class is not much work (but watch out for the two building projects!), and you'll definitely get something out of it. Plus, if it's with Professor Moon, it'll be really funny.",
    "The class is a interesting blend of structures and physics. The class goes from slow to fast to slow very quickly. It is a fun class that will open your eyes to structures.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have limited experience in the field. For students who have very strong science background, this class might be too easy."
