   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "The Haas Library needs a better selection of books and a better check-out policy. Having a book for one day is not really useful when it takes weeks to write a term paper.",
    "Yes, resources are plentiful and easy to access.",
    "The checkout policy at the HAAS library is utterly insane. I understand the 1 day rule (though i do not like it), but i cannot for the life of me understand the restriction to 1 book per day. It is impossible to do research after the library closes which, coincidentally, turns out to be the only time i am not busy with work from other classes. The situation is nearly unworkable. I am certain this must be brought up in evaluations constantly, but the situation remains unchanged. Every other library that i have been to on campus has a reasonable checkout policy, and i do not know why the HAAS library cannot have one as well. Either augment the hours (which seems like a difficult request), or change the 1 book rule.",
    "Yes",
    "Fine. Still wish the library let us take out more books at a time. really irritating and not conducive to working late at night, which is, shocker, what we do.",
    "All good!",
    "yes",
    "Yes.",
    "yes.",
    "Excellent.",
    "Yes",
    "I am always extremely frustrated by the library here. We need to be able to take books out of the library, and the library has to be open for decent hours over the weekend.",
    "The arts library lending policy is absurd. Not all of the books downstairs are \"picture books\"!",
    "Yes.",
    "It has never made sense to me that during reading and exam week the library does not have extended hours like at any other school.",
    "OUr library is so deepy frustrating. I got most of the books I needed through borrow direct so that I could actually have time to read them, even though there were copies in our library.",
    "The school's resources are very available.",
    "Yes, all resources needed for this class were available to us.",
    "yes, everything was plentiful available.",
    "The resources available to me were adequate in the fulfillment of the work.",
    "The attendance sheet at lectures was shamefully infantilizing.",
    "Yes.",
    "All the resources were adequate, thought I do wish that the library offered more options for checking out books. I understand the idea of only having a day to look at a book because other people need to use them, but dealing with the library - especially with ourcrazy studio schedules - seems like an unnecessary hassle. For the paper for this class, I immediately bought the books I needed or requested from Borrow Direct, because it's so much harder to properly schedule around the library's rules here.",
    "Why do we have the Haas Library?",
    "yes",
    "the library provided necessary resources for the class.",
    "yes",
    "All resources were adequate.",
    "The required reading for the course was made available to us very conveniently. Library access is good. Resource availability is adequate."
