    "A fantastic course that provides structure and guidance to developing and writing your senior thesis",
    "Obviously required for senior EVST majors - but don't see it as an obligation. A good way to get to know everyone and the Professors.",
    "Not that you really get to take this course as an option but yeah the colloquium is REALLY useful. Writing a thesis sucks but you don't really get an option. The constant deadlines though annoying are very helpful if you're an unmotivated senior with a problem with procrastination. The classes don't just go over writing a paper which is nice though. We also go over career stuff. ALSO ALWAYS ATTEND THE DINNER PARTIES. For one, the professors will give you a hard time for not going, Also free food!",
    "You have to take it as an EVST major. It's a bunch of fun. Brings the group together. That being said- organize and really hold yourself accountable to your timeline.",
    "I actually do like that the EVST majors requires a colloquium (but again it should only be fall semester). it allowed to get to know my classmates better,and i appreciate the life and career advice sprinkled throughout."
