   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about critical findings and research in developmental psychology.",
    "Thinking about continuities and discontinuities in development. Learning about basic developmental psychology findings.",
    "Critical thinking, data inteepretation",
    "I learned more about the developmental literature and how to apply new methodology in research.",
    "fundamental theories and current works in cognitive development. paradigms in infant studies",
    "This course contributed to my understanding of language from a developmental perspective. It became obvious from the beginning of the course that we cannot understand language without the temporal constraints of the maturational development . Language cannot be understood as a stable cognitive capacity and investigating the mechanisms underlying language acquisition is key to our understanding of language. I very much enjoyed learning how other cognitive capacities develop over time and how they may interact with one another. I think the size of the class was just right to encourage enough discussions and a diversity of topics.",
    "I learned quite a bit about infant psychology, something I had almost zero familiarity with prior to the course. I was also introduced to a lot of statistical learning methodology for the first time. I was able to use a paper assignment and presentation requirement as an opportunity to learn a lot more about language acquisition and some particular areas of linguistics that have relevance to research I plan to do during graduate school.",
    "This course was a great way to increase the breadth of my knowledge on a range of topics in development. I enjoyed diving deep into many critical topics and especially enjoyed the conversations around the content",
    "This course gave an excellent overview in research topics in developmental psychology, with a particular emphasis on the history of subtopics up to that point."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the structure of the course with students leading each section discussion and assigning readings.",
    "It was great!",
    "Great course overall!",
    "it's great to be able to select papers and lead discussions. the papers are very informative but sometimes it was always a few people who took part in the discussion and others did not join...",
    "I very much enjoyed the discussion format and the fact that everyone in the class contributed with one or two presentations. Having a few sets of classes at the beginning of the semester taught by the instructor helped to set the tone of the class. I noticed that at the end of the semester the level of engagement of some students in the class decreased. I wonder if a way to avoid that could be by selecting some of the submitted questions a priori and bringing them up in class to make sure that there is enough participation from everyone in the class. I love the breakfast sweets too! Thank you!",
    "I'm always in favor of more decentralized discussions. I'd also have preferred to have the questions submitted by students available BEFORE the class started, so as to be able to see what other people were thinking about. Even if they were sent out an hour before class.",
    "Strengths: Great conversation, great breadth of papers, nice flexibility in the types of content to be conveyed. Weaknesses: The desired format of the assignments wasn't made clear early on, but was resolved.",
    "I thought the course had a good balance of being challenging, while also catering to the students interests and needs. We had a lot of say in which topics we thought relevant to discuss. I think a bit more feedback on the papers would have been helpful, but otherwise was really pleased with the course."

    "Sure.",
