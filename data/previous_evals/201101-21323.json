    "This course is mainly for people who are interested in advanced particle physics, particularly the theoretical side. It is a very intense course, though rewarding if you do all the work. If you are seriously interested in this topic then take it, otherwise auditing may be advised.",
    "I would recommend this course, it is something every physicist should know something about. I would also suggest to take at most one other course at the same time.",
    "I would say yes, take the course, but don't let the material intimidate you. I do think that it is very important to take since so much of modern physics is based on field theory."

    "As a particle experimentalist, there were certainly lectures that were heavily relevant to work i am doing that may go towards my thesis. Much of the theory taught in this course will probably not be too useful though.",
    "Extremely important essential stuff.",
    "As of right now, I am not using anything from the course, but I am interested in particle experiment and particularly dark matter experiment and in the design of future experiments I think it will be very useful. I also believe that any good experimentalist should have a strong handle of the theory behind the experiment.In summary, I left the course feeling that I had put a lot into it and gotten a lot out of it, but I do think I have a lot of gaps in my understanding, and I am very motivated to go back and rework through some of the text."
