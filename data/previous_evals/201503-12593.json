    "A continuation of first year Russian. Pretty much the same experience with more focus on writing and fluency - a fine tuning and expansion of the first year.",
    "Continuation on first year Russian that focuses primarily on the integration of grammar rules into spoken Russian and more fluent use of declension in speech. Would definitely recommend, my Russian has clearly improved.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to a fellow student. So far, my experience in the Slavic department has been excellent. The daily work is time consuming and can feel tedious, but it is effective.",
    "Definitely would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning the proper Russian language and is willing to stick with the language. The class is taught very well and the homework is manageable if you are willing to put in the time.",
    "Take it. I greatly enjoyed attending this class on a daily basis. Conversational skills will improve with the regular oral exams throughout the semester. Even if you don't have to take L3, don't stop after just RUSS 120."
