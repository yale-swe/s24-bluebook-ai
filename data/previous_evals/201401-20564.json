    "This is a great course if you are interested in a people's history of war. It wont talk much about policy or why's or how's or great leaders and presidents but much more about the soldiers and the veterans and the families they left behind. Cabanes provides a basic framework and background then builds upon that all the psychological aspects of the specific conflict. Be aware it is not for the faint hearted. It is pretty gruesome and graphic content. It is really interesting nonetheless. I used to think war as such a surreal, abstract, alien thing after this class (obviously I cant claim to really know anything about war the way someone who actually experienced it knows) but war became a much more real -unfortunately- part of human psyche for me. It does admittedly feel strange and silly at times to keep reading and talking about things that millions of people actually lived through and have forever been physically and emotionally scarred by but Cabanes treats the subject with humility and sensitivity",
    "Yes it's so interesting! The material is fascinating and there are a lot of cool readings that don't feel like homework. One of my favorite classes as a history major",
    "A YES take this class. It has opened my eyes to so much of what it meant to be a human in the 20th century (and even today)! Despite the title, this class really is about humanity and survival of all types of people in the 20th century. History is not my major and I had never taken any history classes at Yale, so I took it credit\/d until the midterm paper (I was not sure how well I could do in it with all the readings, but I needed a HU credit). There are a lot of readings but they are all very interesting that contribute a lot to the course. Professor Cabanes is also great and simply loves history, which adds to the course too.",
    "HIST 255 is overall an excellent course, no matter what your major is, in order to look at 20th century history of wars and conflict in a new and fascinating way. We got exposure to a lot of history but also perspectives of reasoning behind acts of violence, the impact on individuals and societies of war, and how to draw connections among historical events over a momentous century in world history.",
    "I don't think it will be offered again, but if it is, you should take it. It's a class that everyone should take at Yale to make sure that its subject matter never happens again. It's a terrifying and horribly sad class which was evident every day. It's not that much work, and the reading is manageable.",
    "It's a good class. I liked the emphasis on the personal experience of war instead of grand strategy, dates, and battles. Think of it as history from underneath instead of top-down. Be forewarned, the themes in this class are quite sobering. However, Cabanes is a great lecturer and you'll find the reading list and films to be fantastic.",
    "Absolutely one of the best and one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. This course covers some of the most important wars in a more cultural and less historical context, touching on how war was experienced by people during the time, such as torture, war atrocities, genocide etc. Examines some of the worst in humans, but Professor Cabanes is one if the best. He is a phenomenal lecturer and makes every single class so interesting. This is one of the only classes I've taken here where I have my laptop open for notes and am not multitasking, it's that good. Lots of reading but all worth it.",
    "Take this class if you want to increase your general knowledge of recent war\/conflict history that helps to understand the state of current affairs.",
    "Awesome class. Take it, take it!"
