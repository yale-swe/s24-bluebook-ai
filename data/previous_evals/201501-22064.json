    "Aquachem is nothing to get super excited about, but it's pretty interesting at times and not bad at all in terms of workload or difficulty. If you're taking it, it's probably for your major, and you shouldn't be worried about it. It's nothing compared to chemistry\/math prerequisites.",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise, it is really nothing special. Problem sets can take some time, but the midterm was very straightforward.",
    "An interesting course for majors and non-majors alike. The material is straight forward and fairly quantitative.",
    "A lot of work, don't take it by yourself.",
    "The material is pretty boring unless you are passionate about aquatic chemistry. But if you have to take it the tests are fair and it isn't difficult to do well if you put it the time!",
    "You probably need this class for the environmental engineering major, otherwise I don't really think there's any need to take this class. It's not particularly interesting unfortunately, unless you just want to learn about solids precipitating out of solution, or ions undergoing complexation or speciation.",
    "In theory you're taking this for your major. If you're really good at chemistry, this class should be easy. If you're not, still very doable. Weekly problem sets, easy midterm, easy final. all open notes and very reasonable.",
    "Actually not a bad class. You learn some cool and interesting things. There is a LOT of graphing involved, so seriously invest in graph paper from the start! Also, Professor Benoit is hilarious and awesome.",
    "I loved this course--I thought the material was really interesting and well taught. Still unsure how relevant it will be for the future (probably won't be) but still glad I took it.",
    "The material covered by this class is taught in one way and one way only: problems (okay there are occasional lecture slides but they are only supplemental). It can grow a bit tedious and boring when each class is just spent setting up new systems and solving these systems. However, it does fit together well: each new problem introduces a new wrinkle\/concept, and you can see rather easily how the material builds up over time. If you like drawings graphs and deriving equations, this class is for you (90% of the problems end up in you drawing several lines on a ph-concentration log graph). The class is not that difficult: you can expect to spend 1-4 hrs per week on the problem sets, but probably not much more than that. Professor Benoit may not be the most engaging teacher, but he is very approachable and willing to go back and spend the necessary time to fully answer a student's question.",
    "Only take this course if you must."
