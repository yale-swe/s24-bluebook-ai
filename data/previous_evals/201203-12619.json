   "comments": [
    "A good class where you derive the basic concepts underlying multivariable calculus. Would definitely recommend if you're interested in studying math and were dissatisfied with the explanations in Math 120. Though you surely won't be taking this unless it's for your major.",
    "If you're looking to improve your mathematical analysis skills, then yes. If not, then be sure you know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "It's really not a lot of fun. The problem sets were very time consuming and difficult, and I felt lost on pretty much every topic until I had time to sit down and teach it to myself with the help of the internet. But the midterm was reasonable, and Professor Payne is a nice guy.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in going deeper into math.",
    "I would recommend Math 250 to another student. Overall, I am glad that I took Vector Analysis. At first I was anxious and unsure about my capabilities, having never taken a more abstract math class. However, after a few weeks in I found myself in a more comfortable place, even though problem sets could still be challenging. The material was interesting and the exams were fair. Professor Payne was nice, generally approachable, and obviously a very good mathematician. I would suggest that the syllabus is completely predetermined. As the semester progressed, we started using the assigned book less and less and were given photocopied readings and problems from another book. A decision about which book to use should be made before the semester begins.",
    "I came in thinking I was going to be a math major (I'm a first semester sophomore), but now I'm not so sure. I feel like I had to teach a lot of the course to myself. The material is interesting but in general it's probably the hardest course I've taken in any subject ever before. Learning the material is rewarding but be prepared for a lot of thinking.",
    "Math 250 was a great class. The material is really interesting (if you liked 120 and 222) and approachable. Manifolds and differential forms are fascinating topics that explain much of the simpler math I've done in the past. Definitely take it if you're interested in exploring what real math is! The workload is pretty reasonable for an upper level math course and the tests were very fair.",
    "This class is a proof based approach to vector calculus. It is well designed to teach many important topics including derivatives as linear transformations and Stokes's Theorem. The class is very difficult, and although I recommend it to all students, those who are not taking it for a major should take it credit\/d\/fail.",
    "Rather difficult material but Sam Payne was a great lecturer",
    "It is hard. Don't take it unless you have to, or you really like math.",
    "This class was hard (took it Cr\/D). I feel my proof skills improved - I can at least understand what is going on when I read a proof now. The psets will take a long time if you don't have experience writing proofs. The exams were fair - you get to choose a certain number of problems to answer (so if you don't know how to do one, you can just choose to solve a different problem). The random pop quizzes were a bit much - good thing they were only worth 10% of the grade because I ended up missing\/failing most of them. Sam Payne tried so hard to get us to understand, but I don't think anyone came out of this class feeling comfortable with the material...",
    "Yes, yes and yes. Math 250 is an amazing course and Professor Payne is also an amazing instructor.Math 250 covers a lot of material and is a hard proof-based course on Vector calculus. It essentially covers all the important material in 230 and 231. The material is really fascinating and really fundamental to your understanding of math. It includes the rigorous definition and theory of the derivative, the Implicit and Inverse function theorems, manifolds, rigorous theory of integration, differential forms, integration of forms and Stokes theorem. The course has a weekly problem set which is usually pretty hard; I recommend forming a study group with a few other people in the class so you can work on the Psets together. You learn a LOT by doing them and they are graded pretty nicely. The course also has weekly random quizzes on unannounced days. This might seem annoying at first but it keeps you doing the reading and makes you get to class on time so I thought it was good. The course also ended up using two textbooks, Hubbard and Hubbard as well as Shifrin. I thought that using two textbooks was great since their style is very different and you get two perspectives on everything. If in the future they are only using one of the textbooks, make sure you get the other one for your personal reference. The midterm of the class is pretty easy compared to the problem sets which will overprepare you. The final was extremely difficult, but it is difficult for everyone, so it is curved nicely and you shouldn't be too concerned about grades. This course is really worth a lot more than being worried about grades; it really gives you a deep understanding of a lot of areas in calculus and introduces you to the beauty and depth of proof-based math. It really shows you what math is like and what it is about; everything you've been doing up to this has not been math. It convinced me to be a math major and has changed the way I see things. If you're even considering being a math major, take this course. Professor Payne is a great instructor who takes his time to make sure everyone understands and is not mean about grading; if he teaches the class again, make sure to take it with him.Overall, Math 250 is a hard course but it is extremely interesting and rewarding. If you didn't take 230\/231 but want to become a math major, you will have to take this class, and it will not disappoint you.",
    "Take this if you want to be a math major and didn't take 230\/231 in freshmen year. It will be a great course for you if you like math. Psets could be challenging but they help you learn a lot while you are outside the classroom. Definitely read the textbooks, and read them before the class, after the class, during psets. Read them many times. They are extremely helpful.",
    "No, I'd recommend you Cr\/D it but then your screwed for Math 300 so take your pick.The lectures weren't that structured, it seemed like the professor would just do whatever, and expect us to have learned the material already from the textbook.",
    "If you're considering taking it at this point you're probably a math or hard science major. Its the first class you'll take in a while with actual new math (think forms, exterior derivative, n-dimensional proofs etc.) and is really an introduction into \"pure\" mathematics (unlike say MATH120 which is a rehash of calculus, or linear algebra which is a new way of doing basic algebra). Professor Payne does a pretty good job considering, although lectures do tend to focus a bit too much on proofs and theoretical definitions rather than examples and applications. Each homework is typically divided into a couple of easy computational problems and then some harder proofy problems which require a lot of work. Expect to spend at least 5-8 hours a week on the homeworks; my experience though was that allthe students in the class had difficulty, and it really helped to work together after office hours or review sessions. That being said, the tests were relatively easy (in Prof. Payne's words, \"it's only stuff you've seen several times\") and very fairly graded. The class was curved up, and in retrospect, the material was very interesting, even fun.",
    "A lot of work. Hard Hard material.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who is passionate about math. I did the class after 120 and 222, and I struggled because 222 did not prepare me very well (surprise surprise!). The problemsets were incredibly difficult, but the tests were very straightforward. I would suggest to anybody taking the class to: a) Give it a chance until the first midterm, even if you have absolutely no idea what's going on. Review Linear Algebra and it will make more sense. I felt like the dumbest in the class but I worked hard and got an A on the midterm. b) Find people to work on the problem sets with. Going to the peer tutor hours is invaluable. However, I ultimately am glad I took the class. It was one of those \"This is killing me\" classes that teaches you a ton.",
    "Contra the syllabus, Shifrin, not Hubbard and Hubbard, is this class's de facto textbook. If you're planning to major in math, seriously consider Math 230\/231 as an alternative to this course.",
    "The homework was really hard, but the midterm and final were not as hard, but still hard.",
    "A challenging course, but one you should absolutely take if you have an interest in mathematics.",
    "There are two main types of subject matter: analytical proofs and using manifolds. You need to be able to handle both to handle the class well.",
    "Take it if you have to, or if you want mathematical maturity.",
    "Demands that you allot study time throughout the semester, which in addition to the sometimes-taxing psets makes it quite a time intensive course. That said, it's worth the effort. While challenging, the topics are of far more interest than those in earlier courses. The quizzes and midterm test only on core concepts, so don't get too lost in the details. Just know definitions and understand concepts. Worth the time if you have the time (or if you're a math major and have no choice).",
    "A good course though it got worse as the course progressed. Probably the first 'real' math course you will take in that proof and theory become much more important than raw computation and application. Grading is very fair - though the subject matter can be very detailed an challenging, the midterm and final tested topics that were reviewed fairly thoroughly in the homeworks and in class.",
    "If Samuel Payne is teaching it, take it! He is a very good instructor and gives us fair exams and doable but challenging homeworks.Payne curves the class fairly, so even if you are not good at math, you can get a decent grade. Put the effort and you will be fine! Review the homeworks and the midterm before the final exam. Follow my advice to get the A I didn't get.",
    "Of course! It is a solid foundation of calculus and math in multiple variables for those who didn't brave the gauntlet of 230\/231."
