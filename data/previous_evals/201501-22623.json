   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class only if you already have a good prior background on China post-Mao, because most of your classmates will be semi China-experts, and class discussions will seem like a blur to you if you don't. That said, having a good background can get you by pretty easy without doing much reading, but on the other hand, you do get so much more out of the class if you do take the time to do the readings.",
    "I really liked this class. I used it to get a good introduction to the relevant issues in China and found that it was very informative for that purpose. Three short papers was a really reasonable work load. The seminar was actually a seminar and mostly led by student discussion, which was also really nice. I do wish the class was structured slightly differently though, because a lot of time was spent on discussing the paper presentations, even though they were only supposed to be short explanations of the ideas. Loved the guest speakers too!",
    "This was a great course for anyone interested in China. Unfortunately, Professor Weiss is leaving Yale, so this course probably will not be available in the future.",
    "This class is not exactly a survey course on chinese society, which is what I was sort of hoping. Though it is advertised to people with no necessary background in chinese politics, the class usually features numerous grad students and undergrads writing their thesis on chinese politics. They tended to highjack conversation, and Prof. weiss wasn't great at steering it. That being said, the professor is very nice and makes really incisive comments, and i learned *a lot* from doing the reading.",
    "I would recommend this class. It provides an interesting overview of contemporary state and society relations in modern China and the class discussions are consistently interesting."
