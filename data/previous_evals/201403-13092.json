    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their writing in any way.",
    "Take this section if you want a cool topic with a great professor. I learned a lot about how to write arguments beyond the middle-school-esque intro, 3 separate body paragraphs, and conclusion. This class has long periods of not too much work, punctuated by papers that (honestly) are not so bad (if you do work ahead of time), but can be fairly stressful (if you are like me and don't). Professor Komorowski is really cool and will make sure you think not only about your ideas, but also how to express them in your own way.",
    "The Class is divided into 4 papers each with a first draft and second draft. The drafts allow you to learn from your mistakes and make progress towards a better final grade. Professor does an excellent job of giving you a grade on the first paper unlike other instructors.",
    "You'll learn about capitalism and its relationship to democracy. Some of the readings are really interesting and some of them aren't. It might help to know some background on certain economic issues like the recession, but it is not necessary.",
    "You'll enjoy this course if you're interested in issues such as the widening rich-poor gap and how that affects politics today. Professor Komorowski does a good job giving feedback about how to improve your writing.",
    "Definitely take this section of 114. Professor Komorowski is great, and will truly help you improve your writing. He provides at least three long paragraphs of comments and constructive criticism at the end of every draft\/paper you hand in. The readings were always interesting and relevant to our lives, mostly concerned with economic and political issues. A very enjoyable class -- your writing will improve.",
    "Fantastic class, take it!!!",
    "Highly recommend choosing a topic that you're actually interested in. It makes the readings and essays a lot more fun to do. The course helped my essay writing skills, but grading seemed a little arbitrary and doesn't seem to be standardized across sections."
