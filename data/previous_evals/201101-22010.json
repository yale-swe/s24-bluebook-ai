    "Best class I have taken at yale. It took a subject that I have never had much of an interest in and made it cool and practical (kind of). Prof Irons is awesome and definitely take this in the semester when he teaches it. Take this class if you like movies and have ever disliked physics because it will change your mind.",
    "Good Class. Recommend as a good QR or science for a non-math or science based major",
    "take it!",
    "This isn't a bad way to get a QR credit, although it isn't terribly easy. The problem sets are work and there is no guarantee of getting a high score on the tests.",
    "NO. There are easier QR\/SC classes.",
    "TAKE IT! Awesome and fun class, and the material isn't too challenging. Prof Irons is the best!",
    "Good math\/science credit. The Professor curves the grades and the problem sets are manageable.",
    "This class is extremely difficult. I took it in conjunction with five other courses and spent more time on this than all of the others combined. As far as I can tell, the presence of movie clips in the course only complicate already complex physical principles and equations.",
    "It wasn't very structured, and lecture often didn't teach us anything relevant. Homeworks were okay, but exams were pretty difficult. Professor Irons was kind of all over the place and often went off on tangents. You watch clips, estimate stuff, and do some calculations. There's a lot of estimation and hypotheticals. It wasn't as interesting or easy as I had hoped, but it's definitely not a bad way to get a QR or Sc credit.",
    "If you can get in, take it. problem set once a week + 2 midterms and a final"
