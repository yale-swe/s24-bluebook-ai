    "Benhabib will likely be one of the best, most intelligent teachers you will get. This class was fantastic, and as a mostly convinced English\/literature major there were times I considered EP&E because of this class. Most of the books you read are fantastic.",
    "DRST 006 is a wonderful, yet intense, introduction to modern political theory. I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "My experience shows me that the quality of DA sections varies according to the professor, and Professor Benhabib is the best of the best. She struck an almost perfect balance between sharing her vast knowledge of the texts we studied and allowing us to voice our opinions about them. She was a good listener, facilitated discussion well and was always humorous and easy to approach. She was also very helpful in office hours.",
    "Very good, would recommend.",
    "every important political belief has its roots in this class. take it."
