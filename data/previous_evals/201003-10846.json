   "comments": [
    "A look at the origins of courtly love lyric in the late Medieval period. I would certainly recommend it to anyone, especially if they are not a medievalist, as this course shows you how rich Medieval literature is and how relevant it is to other fields.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, which fostered rich discussion on an exquisite array of medieval texts.",
    "Absolutely would recommend, for reasons given above.",
    "Explica a trav\u00e9s de sus m\u00faltiples or\u00edgenes el nacimiento de la l\u00edrica amorosa tal y como la entendemos hoy d\u00eda. Es una asignatura imprescindible para cualquier persona que quiera tener un conocimiento b\u00e1sico de la historia de la Edad Media en el mediterr\u00e1neo (y m\u00e1s all\u00e1, bien sure)",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to a fellow student. It is a course that is very useful for anyone in Romance Languages who is interested in the Middle Ages, and it constitutes a solid basis for scholars of the Renaissance and of the Modern Age.",
    "I would recommend it for a student who already had a knowledge of medieval history and literature.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student."

   "comments": [
    "A rich perspective on the rise of the lyric in the Middle Ages, the diversity and flexibility of languages and cultures in the time (as opposed to modern border-imposition), and very sophisticated ideas on the debates and kinds of questions critics are still asking about Medieval literature. This course is useful for anyone looking to study literature (or even music, as we saw in class), by showing that there is no great divide between the Medieval and Modern periods. It surely helps with any departments requirements in Medieval literature.",
    "Love is such a fundamental topic to literature that this course has direct correlation to my research interests.",
    "The course related directly to my own interests in courtly love as an art-historical phenomenon. Was a pleasure to be a part of the class.",
    "Ver question 3",
    "This course provided me with an incredible occasion to bring together two of my main research interests. I was very grateful to Prof. Menocal for her help in structuring my final project, which hopefully will turn into a topic for further research in the near future."
