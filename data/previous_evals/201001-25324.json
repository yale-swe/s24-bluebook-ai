   "comments": [
    "Great course. You'll need prior knowledge in either intro stats or computer programming. Lacking one is okay as you'll be able to learn the other along the way (the course is geared toward learning the programming of R, but if you know how programming generally works, then you can spend the time you would have spent learning how to write programs on picking up the statistics you don't already know).Take it! Super useful!",
    "Good programming experience, and some interesting techniques.",
    "First: if you take this class, take it with Jonathan Reuning-Scherer. He is the best math teacher I have had at Yale. He is very enthusiastic about the topic, and he makes lectures engaging and interesting.Take this class if you are interested in learning how to do statistical analysis using R. NOT if you want to learn about theoretical statistics. Workload is very manageable with a weekly-or-so problem set and a final project.",
    "Great class, only problem sets and a final project. The professor is really enthusiastic and helpful, lectures can be tedious at times but have lots of good content. A good deal of programming in R. Project is a great way to tie together the class.",
    "Stat 230 is a programming class disguised as a stat class. if you are into analyzing data you should definitely take this class",
    "Yes its a great course!",
    "If you aren't interested in learning how to use R and statistics DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. The Professor is really enthusiastic which is great, but I'm not interested in statistics so it wasn't fun. You basically just sit in class and use the R script he creates then you have to change the r script to do the homework. I could never complete any of the assignments without going to office hours for help. But the TAs and the professor are really helpful with the homework but that basically involves them showing you how to do it. Overall, I don't think I really learned very much. No tests though, just problem sets and a group project at the end.",
    "This is a pretty good class - you'll learn a decent amount of statistics, the problem sets and final project aren't too taxing, and there are no exams. Prof. Reuning-Scherer is funny and will keep the course interesting; with a different professor it would be very dry. Be aware that everything is done in R. If you're totally averse to programming, or if you want to learn a different statistical package, then take a different course.",
    "Take it if JDRS is teaching.",
    "A useful course in learning how to apply theoretical statistics. Its a very practical course.",
    "Learn to use R for statistical analysis. If you will be working in a field that requires statistical analysis, this course will be extremely useful as it provides a firm foundation.",
    "Definitely take this class.",
    "This is a kind of strange class, and I think your opinion of it greatly depends on what you hope to get out of it. You'll learn to conduct various forms of data analysis using R, and you learn enough very basic theory that you sort of understand when you should use what. However, the theory component of the class is very minimal--the professor presents it all in great powerpoints and probably does a great job lecturing on it, but you never use it for the problem sets and you don't have exams, so you won't retain it unless you personally work up the motivation to do so.Lecture got to be tedious, but I think that's just the nature of the subject--the professor is actually really engaging and fun; it's just hard to pay attention for that long to data analysis. Problem sets are easy and short, generally just copy and pasting R code that was used in class. And since there's no exams, you can really \"coast\" through the class if you desire--good if you're taking 5 classes.",
    "A good intro class, not a lot of work and you don't memorize anything, but a good way to get introduced to some statistical methods.",
    "It is a class about statistics which teaches you how to use R to analyze data. The workload is managable and it is a good class if you are good at math.",
    "Take it! Dr. Reuning-Scherer makes this class. He's funny, easy to talk to, understanding, and flexible. He's absolutely awesome. Know in advance, though, that the problem sets can get really challenging and are often time consuming. Other than that, though, the class is great.",
    "This was a fantastic class! If Prof. Reuning-Scherer is teaching this class, TAKE THIS CLASS. Data Analysis and statistics can be really really dry, and this class is as fun as it's going to get! (it's pretty fun! I know. I never thought I would say that about a statistics class, but trust me, it's fun.) The statistics part is painless (the lecture notes are really helpful), and homework is based on solving questions with R. If you have no stats or programming experience, this is a great way to get some experience! The TAs my year were helpful, but even if the new TAs aren't helpful, Prof. Reuning-Scherer is great at answering questions. Also, lots of different examples (different kinds of data) are covered in class, so the analysis techniques you'll learn are applicable to lots of fields.In short: take this class. Your friends will complain about their stats classes, and you will say, \"Well, my stats class is great! You should have taken Data Analysis with me.\"",
    "The course meets twice a week for an hour and fifteen minutes each. There is no section. Your grade is comprised of problem sets, class participation, and a final project. The homework load seems minimal, but watch out because the problem sets take a few hours each. In class, students learn a number of data analysis strategies using the computer programming language R."
