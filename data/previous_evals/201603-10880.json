    "I significantly improved my wriing ability, learning how to write concisely and thoroughly in French. I also learned about various authors, artists, and influential people throughout French history. My speaking and conversational abilities also improved.",
    "learn a review of french grammar, with some more advanced topics added. useful for me, as I hadn't seen french in a semester (took Yal L2-4).",

   "comments": [
    "FREN 150 provides consistent practice with speaking and especially with writing French. The course could be improved by focusing more on discussion between students, rather than professor-led conversations.",
    "strengths: the way we learn finer points of grammar. Lots of reading weaknesses: same with all the French classes, although I guess language classes in general: the structure gets monotonous",
    "The readings and movies are all interesting and there is a good diversity of genre. It might be good to discuss grammar rules more thoroughly in class, rather than just going over exercises."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who want to improve their French writing, grammar, and vocabulary; more emphasis is placed on those skills than on conversational ability.",
    "I wpuld totally recommend. Madam Sherak is so kind and helpful. I waa not confidet about my writing but with her critical feedbacks i made notable progress in my essays. Workload is not so bad and Madame Sherak helps you reachedule if your week is so packed. Choose madame sherak and you wont regret it. Also L5 is really helpful to learn more about grammar and build strong vocab.",
    "FREN 150 is a great course for those looking to push their French ability to the next level, beginning the transition from \"passable\" to \"fluent\".",
    "Yes, especially if you want to imelove your writing abilities!",
    "I would recommend. It is a great way to continue improving your French skills. The workload is significant but I think you also make clear progress throughout the semester and get to practice all of the essential skills while reading pretty interesting material."
