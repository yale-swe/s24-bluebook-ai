   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend History 315 except to a student with a very strong interest in Chinese history (which is why I took it and why it probably was still worthwhile for me). Lectures were not well put-together and the professor's ideas about writing are bizarre and simplistic. It certainly should not be given a writing credit - you only write three very short papers (one of 500 words, 2 of one thousand) and the kind of writing expected forces you to ignore all historical context. Though the professor is nice and enthusiastic, it just isn't an effective presentation of the history, which is really too bad.",
    "This class is not so much a history lecture as it is a history experience; be prepared not just to learn facts but also to change your manner of learning and questioning these facts as you learn them. All in all, it is a very good course for students of all academic backgrounds, although the grading will seem much easier for some than for others.",
    "This class is terrible if you want actual history or information on CHINA. If you want to learn about peasants, women, and religion, this is the class. If you want to learn about the dynamics of imperial politics and the juicy details about war and political figures, try Wikipedia. The entire goal of this class is to focus on foreigners, women, and religion. Expect one month on religion alone, 3 weeks on women throughout the course, and the rest of the time on foreigners in China. If this isn't what you are interested in, again, try Wikipedia.",
    "This is a great class. Take it if you're interested in the history. For a non-history major like myself, it was great to see how historians like professor Hansen think and evaluate things. She is also a very approachable and reasonable person. She also has lots of fun stories to tell about her time in China. The best part of the class is probably the readings, which are all extremely interesting.",
    "A great class on China, but by nature of the subject (covering 2800 years of history in 13 weeks?!??!?!), it is impossible to delve deeply into any single topic... A great teacher (although sometimes sporadic) who challenges the students in a good way. Really a great history class, you will learn a lot about what being a historian takes.Possible improvements - some lectures could be more structured, but it was nice having a more \"casual\" feel in the lectures on tired days, I never fell asleep in the class (which is rare thing for me in lecture classes...). Paper assignments are thought provoking and exciting, although Hansen could be critical about your writing.You read very interesting primary sources (translation), and Hansen's view on traditional China is very different from the conventional lines of thinking among other Asian historians..whether you already know much about Chinese history or not, you will still learn new ways to think about premodern history",
    "Take it, but not just because you need a rest-of-the-world credit. Hansen is a pretty good lecturer, and the readings\/coursework are interesting if you like social history. That said, this class sometimes feels like getting hit over the head with a hammer a thousand times in a row. There are 5 quizzes, which--contrary to what Prof H says at the beginning of the semester--are not all simple memorization. there are three papers, the first two of which are quite harshly graded. It feels a bit like high-school.",
    "Take it if you have an interest in Chinese history or culture in general. Ancient Chinese history is necessary for understanding everything else. If you are just looking to satisfy a History req, there might be better courses out there. Valerie Hansen is a dynamic professor, but her book isn't amazing and the essay prompts are absolutely maddening. This course is much more rewarding if you have the time to put into it, but should be interesting nonetheless.",
    "This is a comprehensive overview of the time period. Hansen wrote the book and is very tapped into new scholarship so she knows when her book is wrong.That said I felt like this course was more like an anthro course than a history course .There isn't a strong written record for a lot of the course history so we're left interpreting archeological digs and making conjectures. I felt like it wasn't the most compelling history as a result, but still good practice for anyone who wants to become a historian. She gives a lot of training in how to found your conclusions on hard evidence and she definitely wants to make you a better writer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend History 315! Professor Hansen is fantastic, lecture is fun, the readings are interesting, and the writing assignments are very reasonable. In the first or second lecture, Professor Hansen said she hoped to make this class the best we'd ever taken at Yale. I'm a science major, and I still think she succeeded. Her enthusiasm makes the course so much fun. Section included a trip to the Beinecke and Yale art gallery. The course is an intellectually satisfying experience as you learn not only a great deal about traditional China, but also about the methods historians use and the questions they ask to develop the field. The work is not negligible, but if you stay on top of it, you'll do fine. Readings each week include one chapter from her textbook, The Open Empire, and a few primary source texts or secondary source articles. There are four quizzes. There is also one 500-word paper, two 1000-word papers, and the take-home final, which consists of two more 1000-word papers (which can be done faster than the other two), making for a relatively painless writing credit. Whether you are a history major, a returning Light Fellow, or just someone looking for a writing credit, take this class! History 315 is the model of an excellent Yale class. One warning: while knowledge of Chinese isby no means necessary for this course, I think the majority of the class had studied the language before.",
    "History 315 is a survey course covering about 3500 years of Chinese history. Needless to say, it's difficult to get through that many years of history in a single semester, but it is a great class for people who don't know much about China's history. Professor Hansen includes a lot of information on \"non-official\" Chinese history. This means that you get a good idea of what other people groups were doing in modern day China, rather than just looking at the \"official\" record of Han Chinese. Overall, it's a great starter class and you learn a lot. I would recommend it to anyone interested in China or taking Chinese (though no knowledge of Chinese is assumed).",
    "Good course only if you're really interested in pre-modern Chinese history. If you do the readings, you will learn the material, but the professor's lectures rarely allow you to gain a deeper understanding of that material. The professor should lecture on the history rather than on one or two topics or documents or historical evidence. Not a lot of work and interesting material, but it could be taught a lot better.",
    "Yes take it even if you are not interested in Chinese history. You will learn a lot! Be prepared for a lot of work though.",
    "Take this course. It's great and it about the same amount of work as other Yale classes.",
    "A very engaging course that is most valuable for its unorthodox foci. Emphasis is placed on historiography, groups and aspects of society underrepresented by theofficial histories (women, conquerors, trade in ideas), and transitions. As such, I can't say I came away able to place any key emperors in order or even to make many generalizations about politics\/society\/economy in Year X - but I now know enough to recognize how artificial such claims often are.Also: Professor clearly loves the subject. Extensive work with primary sources is a huge plus.",
    "History 315 is a VERY enjoyable class. Professor Hansen is an engaging lecturer, and classes often seem to end far too quickly when she is teaching. I feel that I learned a lot about Chinese history from her, especially about the lesser-known or unofficial perspective, which she touts. In addition, she provides handy guidelines for historical writing and plagiarism, which are useful as reminders. As a non-history major taking the class, I found it to be a great introduction to history and historical thinking.",
    "This is a really great introductory course to the pre-modern history of Chinese civilization. The class is absolutely packed with material, so it's impossible to even begin to list the huge amount of information that you learn: 3800 years of recorded intellectual, political, economic, and cultural history! The class does a decent job of switching between these different approaches, and the workload, though pretty heavy, really teaches you a lot. If you are absolutely new to Chinese history, then take this class! If you know a lot already but are interested to learn more about social and cultural history, then take it as well. The class won't offer as much to people who are really interested in intellectual, political, or military history, but it is still very entertaining.",
    "Hist 315 is a great class about a ancient history you probably do not know. Professor Hansen is a very engaging lecturer who really cares about teaching well. There is a lot of reading, but it is all very helpful and informative, and not overwhelming in the way that some history classes are. Her focus on artifacts makes it very interesting, and we went on trips to the Beinecke and to the art gallery which were illuminating.",
    "History 315 is probably my least-favorite of all the classes I have taken at Yale. The reading is uninteresting, the lectures are disorganized, and the paper assignments are boring and frustrating.",
    "Broad overview of ancient Chinese history--attention to major themes, closely follows Professor Hansen's textbook \"The Open Empire\""
