   "comments": [
    "Learning about the cultural history of New York City was absolutely fascinating for me. I learned a lot about so many things I would never have though of with regard to the city, and I feel like I see it in a completely different way than I did 3 months ago. One qualm is that the readings could sometimes be a little too lengthy and sometimes a bit dry, which could make it hard to really dig deep into any one reading. Also, the 20 page research paper at the end is a fair amount of work, but you can write it on just about anything you want to, which is a fun opportunity. Professor Agnew is a wonderful teacher who is encouraging and willing to help students in whatever way he can. He is a wealth of information and has such a passion for teaching and history. My only qualm is that he has a tendency to ramble\/go off on 15 minute mini-lectures in class, which can sometimes be difficult to follow.",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend it. The course may have left me more confused about the topic than understanding it. However, that is something useful to have learned. It is a lot of reading and the papers are hard but Agnew provides a lot of guidance. The class depends a lot on the students in it.",
    "An overview of the cultural history of New York in the 20th Century. Eh. This course sounds much better than it is.",
    "This was a cultural studies seminar. If you know what that means and you dig it, then go for it but if you have never taken a cultural studies course or you have never taken anything with Agnew, I would hesitate recommending this class. I loved it but it is a very particular taste. We were 8 people in the class and I think we all had good reasons for taking it. Many people had some connection to the city.",
    "New York in the 20th-Century is a cultural history of New York City. So, you talk about New York's various arts movements (everything from literature to theater to graffiti to television), and both how they relate and what they say about New York's changing culture as a city. It's a fascinating and fun class and definitely worth taking! If you took Agnew's Formac and liked it, or are interested in cultural history, you will definitely enjoy this class. The final paper can be on any topic relating to New York City's culture, so there is a lot of freedom there, but at 20-25 pages it does require a lot of research and work."
