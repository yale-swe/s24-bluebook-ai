   "comments": [
    "Definitely. The material is very useful and will help with other engineering classes.",
    "This is a hardclass and is usually only taken by those that need it for there major or real physics buffs. I would say that is you are amazing at mechanics in physics that you might enjoy this class, but be warned it is very difficult. Especially because you have limited resources to learn from, ie. bad textbook, bad TF's busy Professor.",
    "Better than some MechE classes I've taken. Of course I wouldn't recommend it to anybody in the major; lots of work for relatively little payoff, but within the major, it's both essentially required and not one of the worse classes.",
    "It's like just about every other mechanical engineering class: a math class that could, one day, be used for something practical.",
    "I would summarize this course as actually two courses-one to be applicable as an engineer and the other for a mathematician. Unfortunately for the engineer, the mathematical perspective is simply more to do (retain simply for the exams) than to learn. If mathematics is something a student were particularly interested in, or if the student has to take the class for his\/her major, Yes I would recommend this class.",
    "It's a very good advanced mechanics class. I took it as an elective and didn't regret it. Professor O'Hern is knowledgeable and entertaining and his grading system is very friendly; not having to take the final was beautiful.",
    "Provides a solid basis for solving 2-dimensional problems involving rigid-body motion. Lots of discussion of rotational motion, tons of vector transformations, etc. Need to be comfortable with partial derivatives, transformations between coordinate systems.",
    "It's an interesting course, that builds up and becomes rather sophisticated towards the end of the semester. It is a very interesting example of how very simple and fundamental concepts can result in complex problems and solution. It's pretty much your regular, rigorous mechanical engineering course.",
    "MENG 383 is a challenging course. It is typical to see the same kinds of problems that you experienced in intro physics, but of course now with more of an understanding of basic principles mathematically. O'Hern attempted to add more the class by giving us more mathematical background that the book couldn't provide. This made the course more challenging, but more interesting too. I would recommend this course if you plan on spending a lot of time on problem sets. It requires a great deal of patience, and there are a multitude of different kinds of problems one can run into. The best way to do well on tests is to know the concepts EXTREMELY well.",
    "Math intensive. You're basically done if you don't own a TI-89. Other than that, it's just an easier version of PHYS 260.",
    "If you're a mech eng major, you pretty much have to take this course"
