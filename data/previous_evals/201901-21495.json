    "Excellent into to basic concepts of modeling, bargaining, signaling.",
    "I developed fundamental game-theoretic concepts as well as some of advanced topics, and I believe this course is very helpful in preparing for the formal theory field exam."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: Clarity of instruction, manageable workload Weakness: One of the (male) students in the class would ask overcomplicated and somewhat irrelevant questions about the math that took away from the accessible learning environment a bit, but Alex did a great job of getting us back on track.",
    "This class was extremely well done. Sometimes I felt that the math in the examples during section and during class were too fast.",
    "No clear weaknesses, one of the best courses I've take at Yale.",
    "Strength: very well taught between classes\/TA sessions for the ability to do the HW; Alex's clarity and kindness and patience Weakness: too much reading (I didn't do much of it, just skimmed some) for a class that seemed primarily about technical skillsmaybe it was just too daunting to be in a problem set mental mode and then see 40-50pg articles to read; I do wish we read some more published papers with actual game theory models in them, all together",
    "More available exercises\/solutions (esp. for signaling models)",
    "This course is very well-organized in terms of substantive matters and historical accounts associated with game theory tools. Also, pre-uploaded slides helped students prepare for the next day's class and discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student seeking to develop a strong handle on game theory.",
    "Yes, it's an extremely effective course at teaching both the foundations of game theory as well as how it can be applied in real life.",
    "Yes absolutely. Was a fantastic course that didn't require too much time to give a rigorous intro to the \"science and art\" of game theory.",
    "Very helpful for anyone hoping to use advanced models, but also generally useful for clarifying thinking.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to any student who are interested in game theory and its implications for diverse political science subfields because the problem sets and discussion are very organized in ways that could improve students learning."
