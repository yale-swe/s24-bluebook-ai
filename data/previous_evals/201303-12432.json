   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend the seminar to another student!",
    "It is a great course that is incrediblly helpful for reviewing literature and preparing presentations and for this reason I would highly recommend it.",
    "Absolutely. The class is a great way to learn to speak in front of peers as well as how to read papers and seek out their strengths and weaknesses. I quite enjoy it!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I really loved reading interesting papers and I feel that I got better at critiquing the results and methods in papers.",
    "Pathology 680 offers an unmatched introduction to how one should think as a graduate student, and is facilitated by several faculty who have been through this process themselves. The course provides a relatively informal environment to discuss highly relevant research in MMPP, and, more importantly, to work on our presentation and critical thinking abilities. If you are looking for a lab to rotate in, this seminar course is perfect for you.I would highly recommend this class to another student."

   "comments": [
    "Presenting on an individual paper and leading discussion for the class was excellent practice for presenting original research.",
    "It helped me to be more comfortable giving presentations. It also helped me to think more critically about papers and ask more intelligent questions.",
    "This course has helped to some extent, but honestly the research papers are usually very specific in their topics so it's better at teaching us how to read and critique papers rather than learn basic facts for our professions. As for research and dissertations, I can't really say just yet as I haven't chosen what lab I'll be in.",
    "This course taught mehow to critically analyze a scientific paper and ask good questions",
    "The biggest benefit of taking this course is continuing to develop my skills in developing research plans and future directions. Critiquing paper results requires thinking through the experimental process and thinking about research directions, and these processes are very important for PhD students. The professors did a great job of framing the critiques in this way and challenging students to think like this.",
    "This course has helped enlighten my understanding of how to find success as a graduate student. Specifically, the opportunity to think critically about papers in such a wide range of topics has instilled inme the idea that choosing the appropriate method (in a given problem or experiment) is just as important as asking the right questions."
