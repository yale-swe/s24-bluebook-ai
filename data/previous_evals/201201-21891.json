    "McIntosh is one of the most knowledgable Professors at Yale. On top of that he is an incredible teacher, he can literally step into your head and expand your mind. I wish I could take more classes with him. As a senior this was one of the best three courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Lots of reading, lots of interesting stuff to learn. Only one big research paper at the end in terms of grades!",
    "Rather disorganized. Little material in the field to actually discuss. Ending the course, it doesn't feel like I've done much. Being new to archaeological theory made the discussions and readings on that relatively interesting.The prof is great, has interesting stories to tell and lecture is always a joy to attend.There's only one assignment--a fifteen page paper due at the end of the semester. I haven't written it yet and have no idea what I'm doing for it. No clue what grading will be like.",
    "A great course and exploration of a region that's just so understudied!",
    "I recommend it if you want to hear entertaining stories in lecture. Rod is great. However, the material is interesting but so wide-ranging and the evidence so inconclusive that I don't really know what I have learned. A great, laid-back course, though."
