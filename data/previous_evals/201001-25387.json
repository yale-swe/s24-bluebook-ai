    "if you like toni morrison at all, take it, but if you feel like you'd get sick of her books, don't. discussions are good, workload isn't terrible, and it's a writing credit. i really enjoyed reading all of morrison's works.",
    "I recommend it to anyone who may want to read even one of her novels. I regret taking it Credit\/D because I'm pretty sure no one will get lower than a B in the course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to read all of Toni Morrison's novels. You'll come to appreciate her strengths and weaknesses as an author, and the discussions were interesting. Even though we read a book a week, the workload felt reasonable, and the reading was mostly enjoyable.",
    "Interesting class, would recommend it, if only because it forces you to read so many interesting books.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. You read all of Toni Morrison's works.",
    "great credit\/d class. really fun to read all her books",
    "Read all of Morrison's works. I would not recommend the class, but not because of any flaws with Pabst or how it works: I simply found a single author class on a modern novelist exhausting and would not suggest any such class.",
    "Yeah. It's a fun class if you like afternoon seminars with lots of discussion.",
    "Each week you read a novel by Toni Morrison, potentially more than one if the class falls behind schedule. You will be given freedom to respond to the novel essentially in any way you choose, within reason, and will be expected to contribute your thoughts at the outset of every class period. The papers can be enjoyable or tedious, depending upon when they fall in the semester. The second short paper coincided with the last day of class, and likely distracted students from their final papers.If you do the reading, participate in class, and write thoughtful and creative response papers, then you will do well. If you are particularly committed to the subject material, then you may be frustrated by the lack of in depth engagement in class discussions, though.",
    "You get to read Toni Morrison's novels and discuss them in class. The reading response papers are easy to write after all the discussion that is done in class. It is a fun class that is not too academically challenging."
