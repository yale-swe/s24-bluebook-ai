    "Well, my guess is that if you're reading the evaluations for this *mandatory* class, you are, as I was when I read these evaluations, debating whether or not to be a WGSS major. To answer that concern: YES, DO IT! It's a fantastic major full of wonderful classes and professors and fellow students. You get this really interesting theory base while also having the freedom to explore other (complementary) topics that interest you - like in our class we have people double majoring with Psychology and African American Studies, someone who is premed and thinks a lot about women's health, someone who does a lot of American Studies stuff, someone who's really into music, and someone who does a lot of trans activism and thinks about it in her studies a great deal. I also know majors who want to be teachers, English professors, historians, counselors, International Studies experts, and on and on, and Feminist and Queer theory and studies provides this fantastic background with which to engage and enrich those interests. Also, it's a real joy to be engaged in academic work the constant thrust of which is defined by the question: \"how can we use these analytic tools to help change the world for the better?\" And the junior seminar in theory and method is, in my opinion, a great WGSS experience - very collaborative, and full of deep learning. We were really challenged to think of ourselves as scholars and to critically engage with bodies of work with an eye towards how we could add to them. I learned a lot from my classmates and feel much more prepared for the senior essay than I did at the beginning of the semester."
