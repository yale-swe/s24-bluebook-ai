    "I've learned how to draw Feynman diagrams, how to digest information in particle physics papers and how particle detectors generally work.",

    "I learned about particles! And detection techniques. Why is this question here?",
    "Skills: - Keep abreast of the latest developments in the field - Understand the gist of an experimental particle physics paper, and summarize it - Relate detector designs to the properties of the interactions of particles with matter - Think about systematic uncertainties from the detector - Better understand multivariate statistical methods in particle physics analyses Knowledge: - Different particle detector types & their uses\/(dis)advantages - How to detect different types of particles based on the kinds of interactions they have - Relating relativistic kinematics to high-energy collisions at the LHC\/similar experimental settings"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was frustrating having such a wide disparity between students in the class. At times the course could be way over the heads of the undergrads, but still not engaging for the graduate students who had all taken at least one semester of QFT. It often felt like this graduate course was just taught at an undergraduate level. While many of the problem sets were underwhelming, the reading assignments were extremely engaging. I thought those were extremely beneficial.",
    "This course is listed as a graduate level course, but the level of the material seems to be more aimed at undergraduates. If this level of difficulty is maintained in future semesters (as it seems to have been in past semesters) I would recommend listing this as an undergraduate-level course. In any case, I think that a more challenging particle physics class needs to be offered to the graduate students, that at least assumes some knowledge of QFT.",
    "strengths: enthusiasm of the professor and students. weaknesses: rather disorganized in structure and content. would be good if we followed a book more closely.",
    "Strengths: learning more practical skills in particle physics, such as digesting what the data is really telling us and how the experimental apparatuses work; letting us work on our midterms and finals on a topic of our choice, so the assignments actually thought me something rather than make me cram material that I would inevitably forget later on. Weaknesses: I wish we had had a more solid introduction to the basics of particle physics following Griffiths, because I felt like I've learned a lot from just reading it before working on the few problem sets we had. Peskin wasn't a very good textbook.",
    "the course is a good introduction, though it isn't comprehensive--the goals are more skills oriented (reading papers getting a feel for the experiments etc.). It was different in that sense from any other physics course I have taken at Yale, but an interesting and welcome change. It was a little hard to gage how well you were doing in the class, because grades weren't focused on much but that was also kind of nice.one thing that could be changed: it would be good to have a clearer trajectory to the course\/ clearer initial course goals -- just to orient students and help us focus on the need to know information first.",
    "This course was rather sprawling, especially since it covers relativistic kinematics, the standard model, QED, QCD, and physics beyond the standard model with no assumed quantum field theory background. On one hand, this offered a great survey of topics in experimental particle physics and a nice way to just get a lot of exposure to the subject. On the other hand, I occasionally wondered if I really knew anything that was going on, especially when I'd catch myself having to look up what the difference between a scalar boson and a vector boson was with only a week or two left in the course, or what a hodoscope was, etc. I think the course could be improved by further accommodating the fact that particle physics is absolutely filled with jargon, even if it means having literal elementary-school-style vocabulary quizzes each week, because based solely on reading assignments I still frequently felt like I was swimming through jargon.",
    "Strengths: Professor Demers is engaging when she lectures but her curriculum suffers from lack of structure and foundation building. It is hard to understand how particle physics is interestjng from an experimental perspective without a solid grounding in the fundamental concepts and physics. The course would benefit from well organised blackboard lectures and following a textbook closely at least for half the semester. But Professor Demers is incredible nonetheless.",
    "Strengths: - VERY well-taught - Practically focused, helped in skill-building for real experimental physics life - Interesting - Had a good historical overview for perspective & motivation Weaknesses: - A bit unstructured - The problem sets were confusingly worded sometimes - Maybe could have a little more theory"

   "comments": [
    "At its current difficulty level, I am not sure that a graduate student would get much out of the course that they can't on their own, especially if they are already working on an accelerator-based experiment. I would recommend the course to an undergraduate.",
    "this was the first time sarah demers taught the class, and i'm sure she will improve in later years. this time was rather disorganized. the workload is chill, the grading can be harsh but it depends on the TA and ultimately depends on sarah. cool final project.",
    "Yes, it's not a super intense course, but you will learn something from it. The professor is incredibly nice, responsive and knowledgeable about experimental HEP, which makes everything better. It was her first time teaching the course, so she was trying to see what worked best, and I'm sure that the course will be more structured in following years. If you want to take this course to have a rigorous understanding of particle physics, that is not the right course for you. If you want to learn how to understand particle physics experiments\/data\/papers, this would be a good class to take. Using Peskin as textbook was slightly annoying, so I relied on Griffiths for the first half of the course. The midterm and the final were a write-up and a presentation about a specific topic that each one of us chose, which was interesting because I felt like I've learned something from these assignments. Overall, Sarah is great and, if you're interested in experimental particle physics, you should take the course.",
    "Yes, but mostly because of Sarah who is amazing!",
    "This course is pretty freeform and, at the same time, broad, which also keeps it from delving very deeply into any particle aspect of particle physics. In a way, this is nice, because it keeps the math from getting too insane (which it quickly would if we'd, for example, calculated cross sections for QCD Feynman diagrams as we did with the toy model), but at the same time it makes the treatment of the subject a little shallow, leaving students occasionally wondering what they've actually managed to learn. The truth is that there is so much to particle physics that the best this course can do is offer a humble start -- and it does.",
    "Yes!"
