   "comments": [
    "Great class! Miki really cares about her students and she's very clear in her explanations. She's one of the best math professors I've had!",
    "mandatory for any science related major, need to do quickly or youll lose motivation to complete.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has taken calculus classes before. I would only recommend this course to someone who needed to take it for their major.",
    "Systematic approach to calculus in one variable. I would recommend it because the teaching is great.",
    "No, it's too time consuming, I don't feel as though I learned anything, and the tests are ridiculously harder than they need to be to assess if you understand the concepts.",
    "If you don't have calculus experience, this class will be very difficult. Even if you do have calculus experience, this class will still be a significant challenge. Keeping up with the work and making sure you absolutely understand a topic before the following lecture is essential. It's a challenge, but if you love math, you'll probably be up to the challenge.",
    "Math 112 is pretty grueling and boring. The lectures are brutal to sit through, but you kind of have to go to class everyday in order to turn in the problem sets. I would take it only if you need it to fulfill a requirement. I also strongly recommend against taking a section of this class that meets for an hour and 15 minutes--it's way too long.",
    "This class teaches the fundamentals of calculus; what derivatives mean and how to solve them, different functions and their graphs, and the basics of integration. I would recommend this class for students who need a basic understanding of calculus before going on to more difficult math classes.",
    "More difficult the expected",
    "From my understanding -- with zero calculus background before this course -- it's a standard intro to calc course. I don't think there's much wiggle room for a first term calc course, and it's the only option for people with no prior calculus experience. Miki was good enough at teaching, but I don't have much experience to compare her to. She's a solid choice if you're a student needing to take a Math 112 course.",
    "I would recommend it because we need QR credits and calculus is useful. I would summarize it as a rigorous and structured class that gets you the material you need to learn the subject.",
    "I would tell a student to take it if they have a basic understanding of calculus but not if they do not know it at all.",
    "Personally I would not recommend math 112 to another student. Having taken the equivalent to this class in high school, i thought it was much more difficult. Sometimes I would walk into lecture understanding a topic (outlined in the syllabus) and walk out more confused. Maybe the teaching style just didn't work for me but I recommend having a very strong foundation in calculus before taking math 112.",
    "I would never recommend the course unless it was absolutely a graduation or major requirement. The course director is disorganized and that is clearly reflected in the quality of the course.",
    "The exams were difficult. I felt fine in the class, like I was understanding the material, but performed poorly on exams.",
    "I recommend math 112 to someone who has not taken calculus or has trouble with calculus.",
    "Recommend for anyone who wants to learn some basic calculus."
