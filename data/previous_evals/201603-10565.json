    "While the course does assign a lot of work to the students, it is to our benefit. Through the small quizzes that are assigned every morning, I was forced to study every night and thereby saw a huge improvement in my Chinese in just one semester! Sometimes, the classes can become a bit routine, but I like knowing what to expect from each lesson when I walk into the classroom. Overall, the course is wonderful!",
    "Full immersion helps to accelerate language learning, and daily exercises help allow retention of new knowledge. However, sometimes there seems to be too much repetition."

    "Yes, I recommend the course. CHNS 132 is an amazing class for students that know how to speak and listen in Chinese, but may have trouble reading and writing in Chinese. It is suited to either students that come from Chinese heritage backgrounds or have taken enough classes in high school to be fluent enough to hold conversations that include many idioms and colloquial phrases.",
    "Yes definitely if you are a heritage speaker because you will find many people like you that have had experience with Chinese."
