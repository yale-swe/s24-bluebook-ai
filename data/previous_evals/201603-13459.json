   "comments": [
    "Comparative analysis, studying historical subjects from different perspectives, using economics in history and politics.",
    "I undoubtedly enhanced my understanding of economics and finance through this course, which I believe will be very useful to me in the future. I also learned how to think critically about economic issues and debates, which is a valuable skill not taught in the Economics department until senior seminars.",
    "These are my key insights: Many financial crises tend to have similar root causes. I learned what data\/metrics are important to pay attention to when predicting a financial crisis. I learned how the functions of various financial institutions have evolved over time. Finally, I learned that there are often political causes intertwined with financial ones during crises.",
    "We learned about the different financial crises in great detail; what caused them, what fueled them, and what ended them. Good class to see how economics, politics, and even culture can effect policy and shape crises.",
    "I learned how to think critically about economics and assess the possible causes of financial crises.",
    "I developed a very good understanding of various financial crises (Weimer, Depression, 1970s, Asia, Russia, 2008, the upcoming China one) and also a set of tools to understand macro level development of financial crises. I feel far more comfortable reading and comparing economists' interpretations of crises and also in just generally critically understanding the roots of financial crises. The first half of the course was focused on the origins of capital, banking, and investment, which was interesting because our modern day system with one currency per nation and a federal reserve bank need not have been that way; the history of finance was not inevitable. I feel like I learned a ton",
    "I learned a TON about macroeconomics. More than I suspected I would. I also learned how to write a historiography because this was the first class in which I was asked to write one. I really appreciated that. This is probably the most valuable skill I developed in this class this semester. Also have a much better grasp on how global economies are linked after taking this class. Learned so much.",
    "It was a pretty good course, but also pretty advanced. Prof Miller assumes you have a pretty decent understanding of banking, finance, economics, etc, so that should be taken into consideration when considering this course. All in all, I'd say the readings were waaaaayyyyy too difficult\/dense\/long and it felt like the majority of the class skimmed or entirely skipped doing them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The reading was hard and a lot but I don't think it should be changed, that's what makes the course meaningful -- it is a selective seminar after all.",
    "This class was valuable to me because it exposed me to a breadth of historical episodes which I had never studied before, and made me aware of how economic issues intersect with the political and geopolitical. The scope of the class meant, however, that I did not always feel like I had grasped a topic (particularly since economic and financial history is so complex) before we moved on.",
    "I felt that the strength is that Professor Miller was an incredible professor-- he really led the discussions in a way that made them exciting. However, I think the readings were often too technical and long. As a result, not everyone read or understood them, and so class discussions could sometimes be quiet at first, until Professor Miller guided them.",
    "strengths: small size engaged professor interesting and relevant material that was studied logically weaknesses: too much reading a little mundane",
    "The in class discussions were engaging and the professor was energetic and well prepared.",
    "Students should have played a larger part in facilitating -- or simply taking part -- discussion. The professor tried to push this forward too but students didn't always seem incredibly engaged. The presentations were meant to sort of introduce all the topics and summarize the week's reading and then set everyone up for discussion, but for some reason that didn't happen. Also, some weeks we had like 400 pages of reading. That's rough. The readings were awesome and Chris was super knowledgable\/helpful!",
    "I do not have any criticisms of this course. I thought it was well planned and well executed. I really enjoyed it.",
    "The readings were too long. I don't think many people did them and that took away from the quality of in-class discussion. The class also should be cross-listed with econ; it requires a decent amount of prior knowledge of the topics."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely!",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in learning about a number of historical episodes that involve financial crises; I would add, though, that really learning from this class requires doing most\/all of the readings each week. Since the readings can be dense and sometimes a bit technical - economic and financial history is often a little dry - you have to commit to the class if you're going to get a lot out of it. That said, by putting a lot in, you get loads out. I gained a much clearer understanding of the financial system and how it has evolved over time. I also understand how economic history intersects with the political and geopolitical, which I find fascinating. Moreover, as a non-Economics person, I learned a lot about important issues relating to the economy, which will serve me well both in my studies of History and in my future life generally.",
    "If you are interested in finance, you should definitely take this course.",
    "would recommend if you interested in the intersection of economics and financial history. workload is light. One 5-7 page midterm paper, one casual 10 min presentation, and one 20 page final paper.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about financial crises from a historical viewpoint. It is engaging and you learn a lot.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student who would like an introduction to economic history or to more broadly understand how financial institutions function. The curriculum chosen for the class was very relevant and balanced across time periods and countries. The workload was engaging but manageable. There is one small midterm paper (about 7-9 pages), and another final paper (around 20 pages), and you have the opportunity to adapt your smaller paper into a larger final paper. Additionally, every student gives a presentation on the material of one week of class. Overall, it was a great course, and I learned a lot about the evolution and actions of the key financial systems of the world.",
    "I think this class was really good and very intellectual, even if the discussions in class were lacking oftentimes. The readings were awesome and Chris is awesome. Because the readings can be tough and there's a lot of reading, maybe consider that before taking this class. You learn a lot for sure. The class's kinks -- bad projectors, somewhat disinterested students, only three girls for some reason -- will work out in future iterations of the class",
    "Yes. Take this course if you are interested in the development of the world economy as a result of financial crises. You will learn a ton about macroeconomics and develop a great ability to criticize economic history.",
    "It was a pretty good course, but also pretty advanced. Prof Miller assumes you have a pretty decent understanding of banking, finance, economics, etc, so that should be taken into consideration when considering this course. All in all, I'd say the readings were waaaaayyyyy too difficult\/dense\/long and it felt like the majority of the class skimmed or entirely skipped doing them."
