   "comments": [
    "Fairly easy Econ credit. Not the most thrilling of lectures tho - slides tell most of the story.",
    "Sure, because the material itself is quite interesting!",
    "fun and informative course, well worth it",
    "Yes if you like the material, no if you don't",
    "Generally, it was an okay class. I did learn some things but if you're looking for a economics class then this one isn't really it. There's a lot of focus on prisoner's dilemma and political motivations that underlie economic models.",
    "Yes take it!",
    "Decent class- I thought the class was pretty dull for how interesting the topics are. Learned much more in section than in lecture. Scheve rushes through his lectures so sometimes difficult to keep up.",
    "Yes, I would. I feel like I learned from the class and overall it was interesting.",
    "really interesting class that incorporates history, economic concepts, and current information on the economic climate and international cooperation. probably good to know game theory - at the very least the prisoner's dilemma - but also not too difficult to catch up on. there's a lot of reading but prof scheve goes over most of the important points in class so definitely go to class and section. midterm, problems sets every other week (that take a long time) and a final. if cameron is still teaching, try to get him as a ta, but i think all of the other tas were pretty good too so i don't think you can go wrong.",
    "Good course. So much material to cover that you don't get far into the really interesting stuff. Definitely have an econ background (intros) before going into the course, as I had some friends that struggled without. First time it was offered with Scheve, so it's bound to get better over time.",
    "I would recommend this class. The workload is fair and the material is usually interesting. One downside is that lectures are done using powerpoint and can move too quickly and be dry at times. Sections are essentially half econ section and half poly sci section and are mandatory. Overall it's good class and I would highly recommend it",
    "Overall, very interesting subject matter. I understand it was meant to be an overview, but I think we tried to cover too much in too little time and therefore short-changed many topics. Scheve speaks a mile a minute and lectures sometimes felt like a stampede. I guess it just means I should take further courses in the subject matter.Though I understand Professor Scheve was attempting to be engaging with the IPE Idol project (in which you come up with a survey proposal), I don't really think it was worth our time. If anything, it should have been started later in the semester when we had actually engaged a bit with the subject matter. Professor Scheve needs to work on the clarity of his questions both on problem sets and on the midterm (though the final was better), because it was often difficult to understand what he was asking.Anyhow, it was the first time he has taught this class to undergrads, so it can only get better.",
    "Yes, but with the qualification that this is more of an introduction to trade and international macroeconomics. The politics bent of the class is a welcome change from the routine econ class.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the combination of political science and economics.",
    "It's a pretty good class. Go for it.",
    "It's an interesting course and I learned a lot. I think it will get better if Professor Scheve can refine it a little in the future",
    "The material is a good foundation for understanding policymaking and financial crises. Prof Scheve is a good lecturer but relies a bit too much on the slides-- it could be better. Overall, though, a decent fourth or fifth class.",
    "If you are an econ major, yesI am not an econ major, and I struggled, but it was worth it.",
    "No. Give it another 2 years to let him improve the class and assignments.",
    "This course is great. It's a survey course so you'll learna bit about each factor that's important but know indepth knowledge. The course has a decent amount of reading, some of it dense political science reading, but the lectures are interesting.",
    "it was a straightforward lecture, and the structure of the class was very fair.",
    "It's probably one of the worst classes I've ever taken. Prof. Scheve clearly had difficulty making a graduate-level course more accessible to undergraduates, Lectures were extremely difficult to follow due to the speed with which he moved through the slides. The slides themselves were also sometimes difficult to use, either because of unexplained graphs, confusing organization, or mathematical equations that never appeared again in the course. If there is another course that teaches similar material, make sure to shop the other one instead. This course is almost as bad as Ray Fair's intro macroeconomics course from a few years ago.",
    "The lectures for this class can be dry and there is a large amount of required weekly reading. Take it if you are interested in the subject.",
    "A difficult but fair class. It is a true mix of economics and political science so if you really struggle with one of these, it may hurt you. You learn a fair deal about the political\/economic history of the United States (and world) over the last century and, by the end of the course, you should feel comfortable with topics such as international trade, foreign direct investment, political lobbying, exchange rates, capital mobility, monetary independence, etc.",
    "Excellent course if you really want to build a strong foundation for International Political Economy.",
    "This class covers trade relations and foreign exchange. The material is much less mathy than other econ classes and really has more of a poli sci feel. Plenty of readings, and only 5 PSETs.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I'm an econ major with almost NO political science background, and this class shed a lot of light on the interaction of economic models\/theories\/policies in the context of specific political environments, showing how politics can prevent certain policies from being enacted, but also how political institutions can overcome that. Professor Scheve was great; he moves really quickly, but he's super smart, super engaging, and is the type of guy who will stick clips from the Daily Show into his lectures. Beware: section for this class is really, really boring...and in my opinion, unnecessary. Problem sets are long and annoying. And there's a LOT of reading. But the material is really, really interesting and INCREDIBLY relevant, whether you're an econ or polisci person. I'd recommend this class for sure.",
    "Yes, but know that you're getting an intro level class, which will cover many familiar topics such as prisoner's dilemma, etc. That said, I learned more about the justification for international monetary institutions.",
    "Yes, it was pretty easy. Little work, pretty interesting stuff I guess.",
    "take it if you are an econ major or are interested in the topic",
    "IPE is a class about the intersection of government and politics on the global scale, with its most important focus being trade.",
    "Good class, fair tests, problem set grading was a bit ridiculous.",
    "This course is about the politics behind economic policy making. It covered a lot of international macroeconomic history as well as the principles behind these decisions. It's a great course for anyone wanting to understand the news or future development of the global economy.",
    "This was a decent survey of different theories about international economics. Be careful on the problem sets because they write very vague questions but have very specific expectations for what sort of answers they want, so you should ask your TA if something seems unclear because the grading pretty rigid. Lectures were sometimes dry but the slides are detailed so you don't always need to go. As a side note, they seem to be applying a standard econ department curve to the course, which means not very many As, so that's something to be aware of if you're deciding whether to take it Credit\/D. Overall the class was decent, but it suffers from some of the same problems that most econ lectures do (somewhat dry, arbitrary grading, etc). I'd recommend it but only if you actually care about the subject material.",
    "As close a thing to a gut you'll find in the Econ major.Yes- it teaches important things.",
    "Yes, if you want more of an overview of the actual economics and want to know a lot about the history of IPE.",
    "The materials in this class are very interesting and useful. You see them everyday in the news and it's always gratifying to see them and know that you understand what happened and why. I'd say it's more poli sci than econ, and I thought that as an econ major I was a little disadvantaged at psets and exams. But again, it's a good mix when I have this class with all my other econ classes.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Econ 337 is a good survey course of International Political Economy. The work load is not too bad. The problem sets are fairly long but there aren't very many of them - about every other week.",
    "It is a good class which gives you a general understanding of the international political economy issues even if you have no background in this subject. It is ideal for political science and econ double majors like me because it is cross-listed in many disciplines including these two. It is also good for people who do not know much in this field.",
    "If you are an econ major taking this class for fun you should probably take it Credit\/D because the grading is a lot harder than you expect from a political science course.",
    "Econ 337 is definitely a mix between economics, political science and IS. As an Econ major, it was nice to take a course that connects econ to these other aspects, and draws connections between national and international policies, objectives and decisions. Lectures are usually interesting, although the lectures can sometimes be a little rushed. But Professor Scheve posts very detailed slides online, which makes up for the occasionally rushed lecture parts. Professor Scheve is very reasonable with his expectations for problem sets, readings and exams. Overall, good class, and good mix of IS, poli sci and econ!",
    "you learn a lot about how the world works in this course. the workload isn't bad at all. take it if you're interested in the material",
    "This was the first time this course was taught, and it did lack a little polish. Overall though, the course was sufficientlyinteresting, and covered all the topics one would expect. Of particular strength was the framework for understanding IPE issues as taught in the beginning of the class. There were days that I was very excited to go to class. Other times, I was afraid of lectures (and especially lectures) which lacked focus. The problem sets were often vague and loosely related to the concepts in the class.Still, the course was very interesting, it just lacked a little polish. The workload was manageable, with perhaps an unnecessary focus on current academic thought on a given topic.",
    "yes."
