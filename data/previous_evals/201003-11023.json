    "It's good to know what ethical decisions can arise from being in Chemistry. sdo I would recommend this course.",

    "Do's and don't's for research ethical conduct",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to any first year graduate student, or anyone in the chemistry department who is involved in research.",
    "It is required so my recommendation is irrelevant.",
    "It's essential for all graduate students.",
    "It is a required course.",
