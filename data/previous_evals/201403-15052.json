   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the class. It's more political theory than I was expecting which was a little frustrating at times, but once you start applying it to the Maine fisheries, you gain really concrete knowledge about a particular environmental problem.",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Fotos is a good guy. The topics are pretty interesting. For being a long seminar, it goes by relatively quick. It helped me think about issues from new perspectives.",
    "Democracy and Sustainability is the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Fotos is the type of professor aspiring students dream of when applying to Yale. In the class, Professor Fotos makes a compelling argument for local governance by infusing political theory with interesting, tangible, and relevant case studies in sustainability.",
    "This is a great class about the interactions between sustainability and institutions. I came in not knowing much and learned a ton. There's a big unit about Maine fisheries, which is very interesting once you take a look at it. Would highly recommend.",
    "gives a great foundation to policy development and institutional analysis. Great focus on Ostrom and fisheries in Maine. Fascinating topics, and you find yourself thinking in depth about social and economic problems. Professor Fotos is very engaging and a excellent communicator. Highly recommend this class!",
    "I recommend this course to any student looking for thought-provoking discussions and lots of interesting readings. The professor is very accessible. However, look thoroughly at the syllabus because the course title is not totally telling."
