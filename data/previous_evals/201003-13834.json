    "It was difficult to achieve the results required in our schools facilities. The budget available was originally thought to allow the students to outsource the final product. Unfortunately, it was not enough money so we had to make the panels in house. The large mill was not working all semester, so we monopolized the Robot. The shop guys are only there in the day hours, but the Robot is available 24 hours a day, so the one fabrication monitor who knows how to use the Robot was overworked. However, if the equipment had not been available all night then we never would have finished. The large mill should have been fixed faster, or the medium mill should have been acquired faster and there should be more monitors that are familiar with the machinery. Also, many of the students ended up using car paint in house to make the products look professional. The spray booth in the shop is not kept clean, so there was a lot of dust that settled on our panels. The facilities need to be better maintained.",
    "The computers were inadequate for a lot of the work we were doing in Mudbox and Maya. Also the large mill was broken for most of the semester so we had to rely heavily on the robot.",
    "again, the school's fabrication and computing equipment is dismally maintained and poorly understood. Mudbox easily crashes every one of the school's computers, the robot seemed to be broken 50% of the time and the large mill was permanently broken. Seriously, if yale wants to claim to have \"world class facilities\" the school needs to get serious about its technology. The DM staff is completely incompetent, with exception of Eric K, who is the only guy keeping the place from falling apart completely. The fabrication equipment has become the provenance of the shop guys (josh+taylor) who are experts with the equipment, but are spread too thin to handle the constant wear and tear, much of which would be alleviated if the DM staff knew how to maintain its own equipment. Computing power, again, is a complete joke. Trying to run an advanced fabrication seminar on 3-year-old computer is a joke.",
    "The $20,000 that Autodesk donated to the class was ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL to the success of the seminar. It is one thing to look at these panels on a screen, but to be able to fabricate them at such a large scale completely changed everything. There is no way that students would ever be able to afford fabricating these panels with their own money. If it weren't for the donations from Autodesk and Apple, I don't think this class would have been nearly as successful as it was.",
    "The shop facilities at the school are obviously amazing. Even when the stuff breaks because so many people are using it - we somehow managed to always be able to work it out.Having the financial and software support from Autodesk was completely, completely amazing and instrumental in allowing us to produce such beautiful and full-scale works. As students, with student budgets, it would be otherwise impossible to purchase that much material - especially for an elective course. I hope this happens more often because it is amazing to see how productive we can be, and what great work we can make, when we have a \"patron\" that funds the ideas and gives us the support to make them happen. This is nothing new in architecture, but it seems relatively unprecedented for the school. It was almost like receiving a research fellowship and in fact it's one reason I really wanted to take this course in the first place.",
    "need more memory (RAM) and better processors, high end computers, that are capable of handling the large software packages needed for a course like this.the large cnc machine needed to be operational for this course, unfortunately it was down most of the semester which caused much strain on the remaining fabrication equipment.the rendering farm was not adequate in producing the high end renderings that were needed.more disk space on the classes folderalso, in general, it seems that a lot of the digital media budget is being mis-allocated to superfluous machines. it seems that some of the budget should be diverted from expensive 3d scanners, that are rarely if ever used, and re-invested in to more frequently used machines such as the laser cutters, robot, mills, thermoforms, and 3d printers."
