   "comments": [
    "Only take it if you are EXTREMELY interesting in the philosophy of law. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!",
    "interesting course",
    "I liked it, take this course if you enjoy endless reasoning and thought exercises with few rewarding conclusions.",
    "Take it if you're interested in learning about other people's philosophies of law. Don't expect to have much opportunity to philosophize yourself in this class; most of your papers will be regurgitating the works of others. That wasn't really my thing. Some of the lectures are extremely interesting and bring up modern legal issues in a philosophical context, others are a little drier. Prof. Shapiro is a good lecturer, and you'll be comparing his philosophy (which he'll deliver to you in the form of a PDF of his not-yet-published book) to other, more established ones.",
    "It's a not too hard philosophy class that's KIND of interesting...but on a day to day basis some times it feels a little like being hammered over the head with something that is not actually explaining anything.Go to class and take notes. Don't do the reading. Trust me, those 1:40 minutes a week of actually listening to what he says will save you tons of time--he's really good at filling the lectures with the important highlights of the theories.",
    "If you are interested in law, or any specific kind of law and societal order, take this course! It prepared me to approach international law in a new and more critical way.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course but be careful choosing the TA.",
    "Philosophy of Law is a very good course, as it gives you a comprehensive introduction to the main works of legal philosophy. Readings can be quite complicated, and lectures are not always helpful. Yet PHIL 325 is good class for those who want to understand what makes law \"law.\"",
    "A good introduction to the subject-matter--the readings are interesting and at a good level for an introductory class.",
    "You should take this class for a good historical overview of and some basic tools for thinking about jurisprudence.",
    "I thought this course was an excellent intro to the main analytic questions of the philosophy of law - don't expect to spend much time dealing with the normative questions though (what ought the law try to do?), though that's touched upon toward the end.Professor Shapiro was an engaging lecturer who covered a good amount of material in a manageable way. Professor Shapiro is also preparing to publish quite an interesting account of the grounds of law itself - take the course, because you may find out you've been learning from thenext Hart or Dworkin!",
    "This is a fine class but it wasn't too challenging. The professor treats his audience as if they've never taken a philosophy class before, which, depending on who you are, is a good or bad thing. Professor Shapiro, to be sure, is extremely smart and is readily accessible through office hours. Taking the class is a neat opportunity to interface with him. Work is also manageable. One 10 page paper due at midterm time and a final exam. Section participation counts too.",
    "i was a freshman, a prospective mechanical engineer, with absolutely no knowledge of law or philosophy, although this was precisely the reason i decided to take the class. at the beginning the concepts are easy to follow but it gets much more difficult later on (ideas themselves and also more reading, etc.). i say if you don't have a decent amount of curiosity or interest in both philosophy and law, you'll get bored very quickly. if you are interested though, this class is very high level and goes deep into the underpinnings of law, something that you'll probably enjoy. work isn't horribly bad if you subtract the readings since there's one term paper and one final essay test, so i say take it if you're interested in both ideas and get ready to do some thinking.",
    "This is a philosophy class, not a law class. You have to be prepared to think abstractly about what constitutes law in general and, if you are, you will then be able to make some very interesting connections to actual legal practice. In terms of taking the course, much of what you learn is directly from Professor Shapiro's book Legality, so, if you have time, you may as well just read that book, read Hart, read Dworkin, and read Scalia and you will have learned everything that you would learn in the class. Very little of the material is so complex that it requires much explanation, and the parts that are aren't adequately explained or discussed anyway.",
    "I enjoyed the class, but not nearly as much as I thought I would.Almost the entire class was based on learning how different legal theorists have answered the question, \"What is law?\" While that is a good introductory topic, I wish we could have gotten into more interesting topics, like: \"Why have law?\" \"What should be the extent of law?\" \"Why have different legal systems developed differently?\" \"What should be the goals of law?\"The scope of this class is extremely narrow for its topic. It should be called, \"Defining Law Philosophically.\"",
    "I would recommend it to any students interested in law, although I think it would be too abstract to be interesting to people who do not wish to specialize in law.",
    "Professor Shapiro is a very funny and an interesting lecturer. A good class for thinking about some interesting issues that doesn't require too much work.",
    "yeah, if you're interested in understanding the foundation of law and jurisprudence, this is a good class. i think the first half is a little more directed than the second half.",
    "An interesting look at \"What is law?\" The course follows the professors book on this subject very closely.",
    "Take it for the readings, which are good. Shapiro's book is the primary text -- and it's readable, and engaging -- but it's also the script for many of the lectures, which are generally dull. Interesting to see how disconnected legal philosophers are from legal practice and even from the rest of the law school.",
    "This is a solid philosophy lecture. The goal is to find a philosophical way to conceive of what law is and how it functions. We read an interesting selection of theories on the subject, and Shapiro is a decently engaging lecturer who has interesting ideas. The only problem was that the course moved pretty slowly with a lot of duplication--Shapiro spent a lot of time recapping earlier lectures, and the reading wasn't usually necessary if you went to lectures.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, but I also major in philosophy and have weird interests, apparently. Two of my friends dropped -- they were both more interested in the legal as opposed to the philosophy side of things, and for good reason. This class is most definitely first and foremost, a philosophy class. We go through only a few cases in detail, and mostly as studies of how they work in a philosophical context. The first question in the class is 'what is law?' and if that doesn't scream interesting to you, then chances are high that you might not like it. That being said, I think if anyone's seriously considering a career as a lawyer or more crucially as a judge, this course is an excellent primer. A comprehensive legal philosophy is a condition for making good decisions."
