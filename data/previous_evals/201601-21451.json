    "A very interesting examination of Kafka's works! It doesn't matter if you are unfamiliar because Professor Sussman is a great professor and very understanding!",
    "Around Kafka is a great introduction to Kafka's writings and various interpretations of his work, in text and comic and film formats.",
    "This is a great survey course on Kafka that explores his work as well as its influence on other writers and artists. Professor Sussman's class is the one you want to take while at Yale. Comprehensive, yet fun and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Kafka's works who wants a profound learning experience. The class has a very reasonable amount of coursework and remained engaging throughout the semester."
