   "comments": [
    "This class allowed me to learn about the many complexities of the US education system. It was particularly interesting coming from an international student perspective because I was not aware of all of the different structures that existed within US schools prior to this class. We talked about different approaches to education, attempts with desecration and integration, school choice, testing, etc.",
    "I learned about the history of education in the United States, about the role of race\/discrimination in education, segregation\/integration, progressive models of education, some international education aspects. I learned about classroom observations and about philosophy of education.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of the many complexities of education, especially the chronic problems such as funding and diversity.",
    "I learned so much about the history of and problems with the American education system, and it was amazing to learn how we got to this point.",
    "I gained a clear understanding of the various issues and debates unfolding in the philosophy and policy of education. Issues like pedagogy, racial integration, histories of education, philosophies of education, and educational scholarship were all discussed.",
    "This course gives a broad overview of lots of aspects of (mainly) the American education system. We discussed different philosophies of learning\/teaching, the purpose of education, testing, funding, different options for schooling, social dynamics within schools, and a lot about race, its role in childhood identity and schooling, and how it impacts the course of everyone's educational career. While this class didn't make me refine any skills in particular (except maybe how to write like an academic), it brought a great opportunity to reflect on my educational path and provided information and conversation in a way that made me think much more in depth about the structures in place that make up our schools. Something as common as racialized tracking systems, which were obviously apparent at my high school, were never something that I knew to pay attention to, so in that sense, insights were developed about how to view the prevailing social structures in America.",
    "Overview of issues of education throughout history and more recently in the New Haven area.",
    "Academic reading, academic\/research paper writing",
    "Overview on Education in America",
    "I learned a lot about the history of education from multiple different angles. This class is definitely a survey course, so we didn't go in-depth too much on anything, but it definitely provides a great foundation to education studies and the options for further courses within the subject.",
    "This is an interesting class but it's very much a survey. You take a very quick look at a lot of really immense topics in education, which is interesting in some respects, but you really rarely dig into any issues enough to fully engage with it.",
    "Writing skills Better understanding of education policy and history",
    "Super basic and shallow understanding of modern challenges in education policy",
    "It was a great survey course on many of the issues facing the American education system today (but we also had a great part on international education)! I found all of the readings very fascinating and while there were many, it helped me learn how to manage a heavy reading load.",
    "Broad knowledge of problems in\/related to education, how to talk about education as it relates to race\/culture issues",
    "Because of this class, I am excited to pursue an education-centric career. The course allowed me to see my high school experience in a completely new, critical light. A few months ago, I no idea how broken US education was, but now I am determined to take part in fixing it.",
    "I learned so much more than I thought I could in a semester about education. It really inspired me to continue down the path of pursuing teaching as a career.",
    "I learned about the different ways the educational landscape has changed and developed over the years, the strengths and weaknesses of education in the U.S., and the patterns of inaccessibility and oppression that persist in education today.",
    "Pretty in-depth look at the history of education policy in the U.S. to address racial inequities and achievement gaps, culturally responsive pedagogy, magnets and charters, white flight, funding disparities, college admissions and tenure tracks, purpose and role of education in society, etc.",
    "I generally feel a lot more knowledgeable about the education system as a whole from this course. It pushed me to consider styles, aspects, and obstacles to education that I never considered, and it sparked a lot of new interests for me.",
    "Broad overview of history and key policy debates in American education. Focus is primarily on urban education, with significant discussion of the relationship between race and schooling.",
    "I learned so much about the education system, from its history to its current implementation to the alternative styles of education that abound in modern society.",
    "Background on American education, including largely its history, but also school choice, the progression of education and funding.",
    "know more about education, broadness of the field",
    "I learned a lot about the mess that is the American education system, including school choice, racial inequalities, the legacy of Brown v. Board and No Child Left Behind, alternative pedagogies, and so much more. I also learned how complicated the education system is and realize that changing federal legislation may not be enough to address the issues faced across different kinds of school environments.",
    "I learned a lot about the US education system and its issues. I got to do a fascinating school observation and write an essay exploring a topic of my interest.",
    "I've always been interested in education, and this course changed the way I view the topic. Even volunteering in a classroom now, I better understand the motivations of certain things the teacher says\/does. I have studied educational equity before, but learning about it in this class gave me a much fuller perspective. I learned a lot about what it means to be a teacher and a participant in the US education system.",
    "We learned about different philosophies of education, the history of education, and some problems within the American education system.",
    "I learned a lot about the current status of and history of education. I learned how to write a research paper and how to do a classroom observation.",
    "Good foundation and background in the development of the US educational system from past to present; overview of various educational systems both in the US and internationally through lectures and readings pretty far-reaching survey course which was interesting",
    "Learned about the thorough history of education in the United States as well as implications and shortcomings.",
    "Knowledge about the various facets of education, such as equality, pedagogy, indices of quality, etc. Insights about numerous philosophical takes on education.",
    "I learned different ways of thinking about education and educational issues by using different lenses.",
    "Developed insight into the dark side of education and learned many terms",
    "we covered many aspects of education on a broad scale, not getting too in depth but getting a taste of everything",
    "I learned a lot about the contemporary American education system, including about various pedagogies and their histories and the different types of schools. I learned about how our nation compares to others in terms of curricula, teacher training, and student outcomes, and about how various systems of oppression intersect with and compound the unique nature of the failures that afflict American education.",
    "I think I developed a better understanding of the decentralized structure of the US education system, deseg v. integration, and the history of teaching in the US. Opened my eyes to the educational backgrounds of my peers and types of progressive teaching.",
    "I learned important and fundamental knowledge surrounding key conversations pertaining to education in the United States.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of education in America, particularly areas like the teaching profession and the impact of Brown v. Board. No new skills were really developed.",
    "Understanding of the American educational landscape. Introduction to research in the field of education and sociology.",
    "I was introduced to an expansive view of education at levels of pedagogy, policy, and implementations in a formal setting. Some of my favorite topics that were covered included philosophies of education, educational funding sources, and how admissions at Yale works.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of the different dynamics at play when it comes to shaping and changing education. From politics to finances to underlying racial motivations, we really unpacked a lot of the behind the scenes parts of education. In addition to that, we talked a lot about different philosophies and styles of teaching, and examined the benefits and drawbacks of each. This really is a survey class, so it covers a lot of information but doesn't linger on any one area for very long.",
    "A survey of issues relating to education including: education inequity, philosophy of education, international education briefly, ESL\/Special Ed very briefly, etc.",
    "Broad overview of the education landscape in the US and the current issues and history behind them",
    "This class was an incredible balance of philosophy, pedagogical practices, and socio-political problems of education. - well rounded, gave me the tools to talk about what is WRONG\/form my own opinions about education systems today",
    "Well rounded view of American education landscape",
    "Good overview course in American educational history and policy. Course not only provided me with a strong foundational knowledge of US education policy, but also challenged me to think about how we can address issues that come up.",
    "This class was more of a history class than anything else, although many lectures were about racial and socioeconomic inequalities, vaguely tied to education. In fact, very few classes were actually about education I felt. If you're looking for a class about what actually goes on\/should go on within a classroom, this isn't it.",
    "This course provided a great background in the history of education in the United States, as well as how race plays into education in the US. It broadened my perspective on K-12 education.",
    "This is a great survey course on the current state of the field of education in America (and around the world). We started by studying various philosophers of education such as John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson, and Maria Monterssori. Once we've established the foundation on which modern education philosophy is built off of, we moved onto talking about different forms of education (charter vs. public, vs. private), project-based learning, rural education, tracking programs (and how they promote desegregation without integration), and other forms of inequality and differences.",
    "As it was an introductory course to education systems in America, I feel like I got a general understanding of its makeup, what questions to ask, and what tensions exist. It was a great jumping off point to think critically of the ways we can improve education.",
    "Knowledge on US school systems, insights into classmates education-related backgrounds and interests",
    "I learned a lot about the US education system.",
    "A lot of information about education in America and all the struggles to make it good across race, gender, disability, etc.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of the history of education in the United States, past and modern inequalities of the system, education in the US compared to that of other countries, as well as possible ways to improve it. I also learned how to write a report based on field observation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the underlying strengths of this class was the level of engagement from the students. In spite of this class being a lecture, the professor made each class very interactive and engaging. A weakness is that sometimes we focused on one section of the syllabus for much longer than I anticipated and shorter on the topics that I had hoped to explore more deeply. Also, this class was pretty heavy in readings so at times, it would be difficult to keep up with all of my other classes that also had many readings.",
    "As a survey course, EDST 110 sacrifices a lot of depth for breadth. For example, in studying educational segregation in the United States, students were given little historical context but expected to understand policy proposals anyway. Likewise, many topics covered such as affirmative action, integration and busing, and special education were approached with assumptions that students had prior knowledge on the topics.",
    "Strengths are that the TAs are very accessible and the professor is very open to changes to the syllabus to better benefit the class. Another strength is that the class lectures do not just repeat readings but build off of them and involve many interactive discussion aspects. Weaknesses include too many papers (the second observation paper especially was too long and single spaced... I would have better benefited if this were dropped and the final paper prospectus due instead in its place), the midterm layout (two essays and short response questions; I would prefer just having multiple short response application questions since the essays felt stressful, rushed, and as though they did not test our true knowledge). Although the prospectus was helpful for organizing final paper thoughts early, I really believe that the required rough draft submission and peer comments was hindering... especially to individuals who were especially busy during the final week of classes and who take a lot of time preparing\/researching\/outlining material before actually writing their essay. For me, the rough draft was extremely stressful and rushed my research process, creating more anxiety during an already stressful period of time. I would recommend making the rough draft and peer edits optional.",
    "This is a fantastic course that really challenges students to think critically, but I just wish that it had been slightly more optimistic. Before taking the class, I was excited about potentially pursuing a career in teaching, but now, although that is still the plan, I almost dread it. A few genuinely positive reflections\/conclusions on the material would have helped.",
    "Strengths: I loved learning\/reading about the history of the American education system and why we got to where we are now. This course was really interdisciplinary and engaging, and I was constantly thinking about what we learned in this class even when I wasn't in it! I think I was starting to annoy my parents by giving them in-depth descriptions of what we had learned in class every time I called them. This was my favorite class this year, and I think it works well with any major. Weaknesses: The reading load was very intense, and the assignments were graded really arbitrarily despite a clear rubric. My TA never explained why I got points taken off or how I could improve in the future, which was especially stressful when it came time to write the final paper because I had no idea what the expectations actually were. I wish the reading load was cut down so that we could take an in-depth look at certain topics instead of trying to learn about everything at once.",
    "I think that there were some important topics that got back-ended in the class. For example, special education and ELL should have been given more air time. I think that some lessons early on took up time (a whole lecture on alternative pedagogy for example). I understand why that lecture was there--to push us to think more critically about what education means--but I think that was accomplished by the philosophers of education lecture. Also, more lecture time was spent on conversations that I think could have been better had in section. On the whole, the course was very well balanced in many ways and I was glad I took it.",
    "The lecture tries to be a \"leminar\" (seminar in lecture format), and I didn't find that model to be particularly successful. The lectures were engaging enough and gave useful information, BUT most (if not all) of that information was available in the readings, so if you did the readings, the lectures often ended up just being repetition of information. The readings were perhaps the highlights of this course; lots of engaging material about lots of different things. Additionally, the assignments were excellent; the school observation assignment was AMAZING, and the other papers had a lot of fun and freedom as well.",
    "A survey course so this is in its nature, but we rushed through some material I would've enjoyed spending more time talking about. Also, too much reading made it difficult to keep up with it, especially towards the end of the semester when classes generally get very busy.",
    "strengths: fascinating course content, good support from section, not over-assessed weaknesses: hard to make connections in a lecture",
    "Strengths: If you like education, it gives a full scope of many big topics and issues in education. Weaknesses: Prof. Debs oftentimes glossed over things.",
    "Strengths - readings were interesting Weaknesses - too many readings to be able to do all of them thoroughly, too much focus on certain topics. This course is supposed to be an overview of the topics in education but about 50% of the class was on race. This is not a bad thing, but if you are going to advertise the class as an overview of education, you need to cover more topics in education",
    "I think Dr. Debs and the TF's have structured the class in a really engaging way for the most part, and they emphasizes participation and engagement as much as one can in a lecture course. Sometimes we did get a little caught up talking about things that didn't seem entirely fruitful. For instance, in one class we spent a lot of time talking about shifts in accepted terminology around education that felt like it could have been better spent talking about something else.",
    "Good comprehensive view of many topics Feel like more time couldve been spent on a few topics less. Loads spent on racism and segregation and none on SEND and ELL education which was important",
    "The class spreads itself way too thin, particularly in talking about racial discrimination. Because it has to cover so much, the discussion ends up being shallow and straying from in-depth analysis of how those racial disparities actually play out in education and the classroom. If you have no experience learning about education issues, I guess that shallowness could be helpful. But personally, I felt like it was far too basic to be interesting or helpful",
    "Strengths- great readings that really added to my understanding of what we were talking about during lecture. Professor Debs provided assignments that I really enjoyed, such as doing a classroom observation at a school in New Haven. Weaknesses- Sometimes we would not talk about the readings explicitly during lecture which could be frustrating at times.",
    "The readings were really enjoyable and opened my eyes to a lot of issues I hadn't thought about before! Enjoy the seminar-like feel of lecture (student input, can ask questions anytime), but sometimes wish lecture was more than a summary of the readings (not always but sometimes ended up being that way). The essay-based assignments were also really fun",
    "The survey style of this course was a blessing and a curse. While there are many aspects of education that merit investigation, the breadth rather than depth approach left much to be desired. Because the class was only 50 minutes long, we would only have time to summarize the readings and add a few extra points before time was called.",
    "Sometimes I wish we went more in depth in certain topics, but I understand that the class is a survey course.",
    "Strengths of course: Professor was flexible and actually listened to student feedback about the manageability of assigned readings, which was really helpful. The course taught me how to think more critically about education, the way it is presented, and the different ways it can be improved. Weaknesses of course: All too often, the professor was just summarizing\/restating the major points of the readings during lecture, rather than asking us to think more critically about the readings or posing deeper questions about those readings. I feel like we could've dug deeper and gotten much more out of the readings assigned over the course of the semester, had she shifted her focus from summarizing to more critical and challenging queries.",
    "Classroom observation assignment was definitely the best and most exciting part of the course. Reading load was quite heavy, and although many of the readings were interesting, they often were not necessary at all in order to do well in the course. Professor Debs did adjust the reading load some to feedback throughout the semester, though, which was great.",
    "This course needs to seriously reevaluate its framing. I understand presenting academic arguments, but the way that some subjects were framed felt inappropriate at times... Special education and ELL in the same lecturewhat does that signal? Pros and arguments for desegregation? Seriously?",
    "I love that the class is a sort of 'leminar' and that different modes of teaching are employed in every class--standard lecturing, class discussions, anonymous student input projected on the board via Mentimeter (or some other service of the same kind, I can't remember), videos, charts, etc.",
    "I liked how Professor Debs incorporated segregation and its impacts on our education system since it isn't discussed much. However, Professor Debs would also include readings about other minority groups, but they didn't fit that week's lesson plan and she would only brush over them in class. As a minority student, I wish we could've actually learned about our role in education.",
    "This course is a survey course of education, and it serves that purpose really well. Though it doesn't go very in depth into many topics, it does a good job in the time allotted for the massive amount of material at providing students with a baseline knowledge of the education system. Also, all the assignments were really interesting to do, and I was always excited to do my work for this class. I loved having the opportunity in section to discuss readings and hear other people's perspectives on what was covered in lecture. One additional strength was Professor Debs' focus on the experiences of people in the class; I liked that she always welcomed people's input on topics we discussed that they had experience with.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Debs is very responsive to student feedback and concerns, lots of opportunities to get feedback on written work, professor and TAs all very engaged in teaching this course Weaknesses: quite a heavy reading load, pacing of the course is quite in-depth at the beginning of the semester and then seems rushed at the end (e.g. we spent several weeks discussing desegregation, but then special ed, rural schools, and ELL were all covered together in one week)",
    "The assignments are a great strength of the course. I was highly engaged with each assignment because they were not run-of-the-mill papers. They were so different to anything I had previously done and allowed the students true freedom to pick what they found most engaging. A weakness of the course was the discussion section simply because it was unnecessary. There was so much discussion in the course anyways that a discussion section seemed redundant.",
    "I think there could be more material on teaching methods and alternative schooling, such as charter schools, Montessori, project based learning etc. Section was very helpful as well in this course.",
    "too general, but that might be a challenge with any intro class",
    "Strengths: The assignments were really cool. I especially loved the classroom observation because you get to see in person the issued faced in classrooms. Also the final paper gave you so much freedom to explore any topic and was structured in a way that forced you to stay on top of the assignment (presentations, rough draft, etc). I especially liked the in-class presentations and peer edits. This course also makes you want to dive deeper into specific education topics, which is the goal of an intro course. Weaknesses: you spend so much time talking about race (which can't be avoided) that you don't get to dive deep into certain topics, like international school reform or alternative teaching certifications, etc. I also felt like we conflated race & class a lot during the course and wish we had talked more about class specifically. Also, you don't really get much of an international perspective.",
    "The breadth of this course and range of issues we covered meant that everyone found at least one topic that was really interesting to them. The way we were taught and graded in this course was ironically outdated for an education course - the professor summarized the readings in class, and the midterm and quiz simply tested if we had read them.",
    "The course was very good at providing factual information. Lectures were straightforward, and assessments matched up with the content of readings and classes. I had a good experience with section and found that the entire class seemed engaged with the course. I also think the project-esque steps of the final paper was a great ending experience. This course really suited a range of levels; I enjoyed it as a first-year and I know seniors who did as well. It could be improved by cutting back on some of the reading, a suggestion Professor Debs adapted to midway through the course. Content was spread out towards the beginning of the course with a lot of important topics squished in at the end, so perhaps pacing could be slightly improved.",
    "The course gave a good overview of a lot of education-related topics, but it sometimes felt like we were rushing over super important topics. For example, we talked about special education and English language learners all in one lecture, both of which a lot of students were interested in discussing thoroughly, but it felt more like a superficial nod rather than an actual consideration of the topic. I think we might have spent too much time focusing on abstract concepts such as philosophy and power dynamics in schools without really looking at related policy, so there could be a better balance between these themes and the more topical, policy-related ones. I also think the final paper had a lot of components including poster presentations and peer editing, and I liked that these were low stakes and gave me feedback. However, I don't know if everyone benefitted from these steps, and I think it might be more productive to make peer editing optional so the students who want to give and receive feedback can do so, but not everyone is forced to participate. I loved my section with Clare and felt like we had very fruitful discussions as an addition to the lectures, but I think the lectures should be reformatted a little bit. I think Professor Debs tries to make the lectures very interactive, but I think this didn't always work and we spent too much time have discussions during lecture when we could have been covering more ground, as I mentioned earlier. I'd say that it would be best to maintain the lecture format, and allocate discussion time to section. I get that it is an attempt to implement an innovative pedagogy, but I think some important material could have been lost in these efforts.",
    "There is an unrealistic amount of reading and the Professor seemed to know this and not want to fix it. It was unclear what the overarching goals of the class were.",
    "Prof Debs is great!",
    "I didnt feel like I got a lot out of this course. There isnt much of a focus on the history of structure of the American education system, but rather a disproportionate focus on race as a measure of inequity, as opposed to other important factors which were not focused on. I didnt really like how the class was taught in the sociological lens, and felt like we didnt learn much other than that there is a huge achievement gap between races. Also, I feel like there was too much of a theoretical focus without any discussion on how to fix many of these issues. For example, extensive discussions about failing urban education systems because of a lack of funding, without adequate context as to why there is a lack of funding or how funding could be increased (money doesnt come out of thin air!)",
    "Lectures were interesting, would have liked to spent more time on issues that affect schools today (e.g. Asian American lawsuit against universities like Harvard) though I understand that the education system is so vast that it can be impossible for just 1 semester; good introduction to education systems in general though",
    "Strength lies in the breath of this class but as such theres no in-depth analysis until the final.",
    "Strengths- interesting material. Readings were very insightful. Weaknesses- lectures werent always helpful.",
    "Rural education deserves more than just a single lecture and special education and ESL education shouldnt be combined into one lecture",
    "The biggest strength of this course is that it presents a wide variety of educational topics for students to explore. However, this can also be a weakness because it didn't provide a lot of depth into each topic.",
    "Strengths: I learned A LOT about the worlds of education. The biggest issue was probably that sometimes it felt like prof. Debs was trying too hard to make a 100 person lecture feel like a seminar, which made it feel slow at times. Also, would have loved to have more guest speakers.",
    "as a lecture you could not delve deeply into material, but since it is an intro course that's understandable",
    "Dr. Debs is a great lecturer and does a really good job making listeners feel engaged by asking us to incorporate personal experiences and opinions, both by asking us directly and by using Menti. Conceived as a survey, I think the course fulfills its purpose. However, I think some of the readings poorly chosen to illustrate concepts of contention, and many students felt like the benefits of desegregation in particular were given short shrift.",
    "Professor Debs has a great, unique lecture style. However, there are a lot of readings.",
    "Strengths: readings, interesting start especially, great class atmosphere. Potential weaknesses: some readings werent always relevant, I dont think the reading load needed lightened if we were reading for meaning, sharing between peers took up a lot of lecture time, and found the lack of structure during section made section feel a bit pointless.",
    "The course was very broad in nature, which makes sense. However, it was so broad that it was overwhelming and felt as if we could not focus on anything in as much depth as the topic warranted.",
    "Strengths: the TFs were incredible, and we had very good discussions in section. Some of the readings were very eye-opening. Weaknesses: the course in general felt very superficial and not academically rigorous. It felt a lot like learning about each other's opinions on how things in education should be done, rather than studying the practical and historical implications of different options with academic rigor. Also, I wish we had spent more time and gone more in-depth on the philosophies of education portion of the class, and spent less time discussing race in education (I think we spent no less than six lectures on this issue alone). I rarely felt like I learned anything I could have learned by reading some news articles.",
    "This class mixes learning styles (lectures, sections, and independent research) to expose students to different aspects of the American education system. Professor Debs has interesting lectures and, while upfront about her personal connection to much of the subject matter, does not declare anything as inherently right or wrong.",
    "This course covered a lot of material very quickly, which makes sense since it's a \"sampler\" course, but I do wish it could explore more topics in detail rather than whizzing by them. Professor Debs was very, very receptive to student input --- when students told her that they felt overwhelmed with the readings, she went back and made several of them optional.",
    "Strengths: Professor Debs is really responsive to student feedback. If there's a problem or issue, students will bring it up and she will adjust as necessary. This class covers a lot, but it also takes students' experiences into account, so even though it is a decently sized lecture, there is still a lot of peer-peer and student-teacher interaction throughout the class. Weaknesses: There was a lot of reading that sometimes seemed unreasonable. The syllabus got adjusted a few weeks into the course, and I'd recommend using that syllabus for the whole course because having some readings listed as optional or saying what parts to focus on made it a lot more effective to retain information",
    "Strength: you are getting a dip into each aspect relating to education, it can be helpful if you are already interested in Ed studies and looking to get a bit of information about everything to help decide what you want to focus on. The final project gives you a great opportunity to dive into just one topic that you were really interested, or a topic that we havent talked about that you are passionate about. Weakness: if you are looking for really in depth discussion on a particular topic, perhaps race, inequity etc. You arent going to get that bc there is so much that needs to be covered. But i think section can be really great for bringing up those points",
    "it was an overview, so some of the interesting topics and discussions felt rushed, but it did give an overall survey of the education landscape.",
    "Strengths above ^ Weaknesses: often too well-rounded, felt I couldnt go in depth about topics of interest because we tried to dip our toe in everything. I understand thats a product of a foundational course, but I feel it couldve been a bit more intentional.",
    "Reading intensive Very American education centric",
    "I would've liked more projects like the classroom observation paper, where we got the hands-on opportunity to witness and interact with a K-12 classroom in the area.",
    "I didn't feel like this class was actually about education in the way I expected or would have liked. For example, I would have liked to learn about useful educational techniques used in the classroom or something. Maybe the issue is that the course taught so much breadth it lacked greatly in depth. I feel like I hardly learned anything. I guess that's the way with survey courses, but I was pretty disappointed and disengaged.",
    "This course was very strong in history, and I believed the mandatory observation of a classroom in New Haven was extremely helpful and a great part of the class. The class could have done more with different types of education -- it flew past education for the differently abled, rural education, and international education. These parts were very interesting and I think we could have learned more about it!",
    "The course is very organized and Professor Debs\/TA's are super receptive to feedback! For example, half-way through the course, the students expressed concerns with how much reading there was and Professor Debs made an active effort to trim down some of the readings--really appreciated that! I thought there might have been 1 too many assignments in the syllabus but it's a great course! You even get to observe a school in the New Haven area, which I think is a super cool and unique experience.",
    "Each section is unique in its discussion of the texts\/lecture material, so while it is great that they are not formulaic\/standardized discussions, a lot of a student's experience depends on how interested they are in your TA's approach to the material.",
    "Strengths: The staff (Professor Debs and the TFs) really cares about the content of the class and the critical study of education generally. Though lectures are only 50 minutes, as long as you read the readings, you will get a thorough critical analysis of the subject of the week. Weakness: The reading workload was extensive on some weeks. Other times, Professor Debs encouraged us to read texts I didn't feel were critical enough or had weird premises.",
    "Strength: lots of topics covered and all were very interesting. Weakness: would have liked to cover some things in more detail- I think at times the class could have moved faster to achieve this",
    "The class did an excellent job of going over a core set of material for understanding education, particularly the American education system. I love how engaging most of the lectures were, especially the use of Menti to pool everyone's educational experience and see how these seemingly abstract educational policies and practices impact people on the ground level. I also loved how the TFs and Professor Debs made themselves easily accessible for meetings to discuss material or final paper topics. One of the main strengths of the class is the sheer number of opportunities you have to received feedback on your work, and I especially enjoyed the last week of roundtable discussions with our peers on our final paper topics. Personally, I never found discussion sections particularly useful, though that might have been an issue with the TF leading my section. I'd say the biggest weakness of the class is the sheer amount of assigned readings and assignments. The number of assignments and the amount of reading required definitely felt like they were for a seminar-level course rather than an intro class geared towards first-years. While Professor Debs was response to student feedback and cut down on the required readings as the semester went on, it still felt like this was an issue throughout the semester. The assignments, while creative and unique in comparison to all the other courses I've taken at Yale, felt like too many for a lecture course.",
    "It relied on everyone having some basic grasp of education in America, how the government functioned in the US, and how things like property taxes worked. So it was very difficult for international students who have no background knowledge. Also there is a lot of reading. I like how the course valued student participations and had anonymous polls.",
    "I appreciated that time was allotted during lectures for student input on the topic at hand (menti.com and partner\/group discussion). The midterm quizzes were based fully on the content discussed in lecture. The classroom observation was a unique and fun experience."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in teaching or education in general, I highly recommend a=taking this class! It gives a good overview about the broad topic of education.",
    "If you are interested in education I would suggest taking a course more specified to your field of interest first. The survey course is not the best choice for your first exposure to the field.",
    "I would recommend the course to all students, since learning about the foundations of education in the country in which one studies is important. It provides a good overview of the system in the United States. However, I would like to see some changes in course outline (i.e. fewer lessons on the issue of discrimination\/race in education and more than one half lecture on special education\/ELL learning) before highly recommending it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student who is considering early childhood or K-12 teaching as well as anyone who wants to better understand the challenges of the American education system.",
    "Absolutely! I am a little biased because I enjoy education, but if you want to rethink your own schooling experience in a larger educational context, this is definitely the course for you. This is a survey course, though, so beware that we don't really go into anything in depth.",
    "I would very much recommend this course to another student. It felt like relevant policy discussions were regularly had, and I really was interested in the topic. I was a big fan of this class, and if you're interested in Ed Studies you will be, too. Professor Debs is fabulous and accessible, and the makes the material fabulous and accessible, too.",
    "This class is a great way to reflect on your own journey through the education system. It covers a pretty broad range of topics, so if you just want to get a taste of lots of different aspects of education, this class could work for you. If you take the class, you will definitely get the most out of doing the readings, so if you're interested in a specific area of education or are wanting a class that is more about conversing about ideas rather than learning the state of things in our system, then there are probably other EDST classes that would be better suited for you. But this class does have a lot of potential to get you excited about some aspect of school!",
    "Yes.",
    "Unless you really are thinking about doing the Ed Studies program, dont take this class.",
    "Not sure. On one hand, you get a good amount of information about topics in education. But the level of attention given to topics is not balanced so make sure you are prepared to have long detailed discussions on race issues in education. Additionally, professor Debs said some controversial stuff that was not really addressed. The workload is also more than you would like as you really need to do a lot of readings and the papers were a lot and not too structured.",
    "I'd recommend this course to any student who's interested in learning more about education and doesn't know where to start.",
    "If you're interested in education policy and really want a broad overview in a reasonably interesting format then you could definitely do a lot worse than this class.",
    "He s- very interesting and engaging",
    "If you want to go into education studies, you have to. Otherwise, if you have any level of experience studying education, I dont think so.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in being exposed to some educational issues that are not always acknowledged, take this course. It is also a requirement for the Educational Studies program, so if you are even considering applying for that program, take this course to develop an understanding for if it is right for you.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in education studies please take :)",
    "Yes! Even if you are not interested in the EDST program, this class is a great way to see your education from a new perspective. Education will always be a relevant field for innovation, so all students should take this class.",
    "Yes. I believe as students at an institution like Yale its important to learn about the inequalities that may have contributed to our entrance into this university.",
    "If you think you have an interest in education, you should take this course. It can really open your eyes to the different issues and problems that are involved in education, and lead you to realize personal passions about certain areas of education you were previously unaware of. While the readings can feel lengthy, overall, the workload\/assignments are pretty manageable + fair.",
    "Yes -- if you're at all interested in studying education. This class is flawed, and you'll either love the subject matter despite the flaws or come to hate the subject matter because of the class's flaws. The subject matter itself can also cause frustration -- coming in with a somewhat predefined\/reflected on interest in education helps.",
    "No. Don't take this course unless you HAVE to for the Ed Studies program. I took this course thinking I wanted to apply for Ed Studies, but then this course literally turned me off from the program. Or at least don't take it with Debs.",
    "Yes, great place to start if you're interested in education policy\/structure.",
    "Unfortunately, no. This is one of my least favorite courses at Yale. I did not like the structure of the class. We had to visit a local, New Haven elementary school as a part of the course. However, I was not fond of this assignment due to Yale's rocky history with the surrounding community and the clear one-sided power dynamics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student, especially if you are at all interested in education. I was always excited to go to class and to do the readings because the material and the questions addressed by this course were so interesting and relevant. It did a good job of growing the interest I already had in the education system, and it made me want to take more classes in ed studies.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides a good overview of the history and the key policy questions being discussed in education today, and it provides a lot of opportunities to reflect on the meaning of your own educational experiences.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, making sure they understand this course will not present them with a solution to fixing American's education system. However, it will present you with the knowledge you need to create your own solutions.",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in learning about American education and the inequality and inequity that exists in access to public education.",
    "I would if they had never done anything in the field of education and they want a fun elective before but if they are actually interested in learning about education, I would choose one of the other more specific education classes.",
    "YES a thousand times yes, especially if you are even marginally interested in teaching or going into public policy. It's also mandatory if you want to do the Education Studies program. I already knew that many of these issues existed in the American education system, but didn't know much detail. You learn why everything is so hard to fix with legislation. It's definitely a course that will leave you with more questions than answers--I think it's designed so that you will take other education studies courses.",
    "I do not recommend this course to international students, as the US context of the course simply does not translate much to other countries. This course is a good fit for students who are already familiar with a lot of the issues we discuss - the readings focus on conservative and progressive takes on education problems, skipping the moderate positions by assuming that the students already know them.",
    "Yes! This course is particularly great for anyone who has interest in education as a possible career, but also for anyone who just wants to learn more about the system in which they are a part of. You did not need much background knowledge, and the course was very interesting. I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to take a gut or has no interest in education, but other than that, I very much recommend the course.",
    "I would if they are interested in getting a broad overview of education, participating in the Education Studies program, or just getting a prerequisite for other Ed Studies classes. We definitely did cover some education related topics I wanted to learn more about, such as No Child Left Behind and school choice. However, I would warn them that it feels like you're really only scratching the surface and at times it will feel unclear what information you're really getting out of it. If they are interested in a specific topic like special education, international education, or language learning, I would also warn them that they might not get a lot out of this course in that respect. That said, it is a good course for someone who just generally warns to learn more and think more critically about education.",
    "Only take this course if you are seriously considering the Educational Studies Program -- it's not worth it otherwise. There is so much reading you can't possibly do all of it. Professor Debs and the TAs know that and basically tell you not to read them at the beginning of the semester which makes it feel a little pointless. The writing assignments are long and hard, and the instructions you receive for them are unclear to begin with and change all the time. If you are passionate about education and the Program then take this class, but if not, don't bother.",
    "yes!",
    "Probably not. Its an okay class, but not a great one. The curriculum is very average, most people Ive talked to in the class didnt feel like they got much out of it. Its superficial at times, glossing over huge aspects of American education such as the Civil Rights Movement. Instead, its very much a sociology class which almost entirely focuses on racism in the education system. A peer of mine compared it to an extension of a Race, Politics, and the Law. Not saying this is a bad thing, but definitely not a survey education course.",
    "I would if you are interested\/need to fulfill the requirements for the educational studies program (which is obvious) but it was interesting and important to learn about the US education system as a whole. Really eye-opening and made you think deeper about contemporary political and economic issues.",
    "Great foundation class for the history of education of the class. You leave never dishearten about the future of education in the US.",
    "Definitely. This survey course on education studies in my opinion is very important in exposing students to different perspectives of education they may be unfamiliar with, given the heterogeneity of students educational backgrounds.",
    "Yes, this is a great course for any student interested in education.",
    "Yes, it's an intro class.",
    "Yes, if you are genuinely curious about the education world. A warning: this class should be renamed the injustices of the Ed. World because it was super focused on education inequality",
    "Yes, especially because I am in the ed studies program and you need it. Also, there are issues about education that I had not given significant thought to because it was not in my concentration, so its good to broaden one's scope",
    "Yes- very good survey of education system and pedagogies",
    "I would, because its necessary grounding for any future courses about education and does a good job laying the groundwork for students to explore more specific topics of interest.",
    "Yes!",
    "Sure would. Made me very excited for a future career in teaching.",
    "Yes. Despite its problem, it serves as a valuable introduction to the conversation of education in the United States.",
    "You have to if you're applying for the ed studies program. If you're not, I would recommend taking a different education studies class that focuses on an area of education you're particularly interested in.",
    "This was a broad survey course on American education which means it is relevant to anyone who has gone to school, which is you! This course will make you think critically about your high school and other educational experiences and perhaps make you value the Yale experience even more.",
    "If you're interested in education or teaching, I would recommend this course since it covers many topics in that field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you're interested in applying to the Education Studies program, this is a prerequisite, but even if you aren't interested in pursuing education at all, I think this class is really important. Yale has students with wildly different educational experiences, and I think this class is really vital for exposing why those experiences were so different and what can be done to try and bridge the gap while at Yale. Students coming from private or prep school backgrounds learned a lot of the complicated dynamics surrounding public schools and charter schools, and understand their peers a bit more. Students from FGLI backgrounds or who attended less supportive schools got to understand the factors that contributed to those schools as well as learn some of the skills that help make private school students successful that they may not have been exposed to otherwise.",
    "Yes, I legitimately enjoyed this class and learned a lot from my papers. I actually loved my section and looked forward to it each week.",
    "Yes if you are interested in gaining a survey of issues relating to education",
    "yes, even if you are not interested in education, the themes and topics overlap with history, politics, and American history, and it is interesting to hear other people's educational experiences and perspectives",
    "Yes Id recommend it to anyone remotely interested in education, social issues, or politics... really anyone who wants to be an active citizen (so hopefully everyone).",
    "Yes, it is a good overview course and provides a general understanding of the history of US education.",
    "If you're looking for a class about what actually goes on\/should go on within a classroom, this isn't it. It's more about history and racism than anything else, much less education. Also this class isn't considered a gut nor was I looking for one, but I put in such minimal effort (bc I disliked it so much I switched to credit\/D) and got a fat easy A without doing any readings and skipping multiple classes. I sincerely don't think they read my final essay.",
    "Yes! I think this course really does serve as a good foundation for education. If you want a good basic knowledge of the education system, this class will give it to you.",
    "Absolutely! Take this course if you're interested in learning about education in America! You don't have to be interested in the Ed Studies program to take this! Also, the assignments and opportunities are one-of-a-kind (i.e. classroom observation in New Haven, hearing from Dean of Admissions Jeremiah Quinlan, etc.)--so take it even if you have the slightest interest in this field!",
    "Yes, if they have an interest on a very broad range of issues regarding education, and don't mind learning about things that aren't their primary interest in the education field.",
    "Yes, really interesting readings and lectures.",
    "Yes, I absolutely loved it. Especially if you engage in section, you will find yourself learning new things from Professor Debs, your TF and your fellow students every week.",
    "Yes, because I genuinely found it really fascinating and engaging",
    "I would recommend this course if you're at all curious about American education or you're interested in learning more about the key issues are in education today (across various contexts, some international). of course, if you're interested in ed studies in general, this course is a no-brainer. The lectures are very interactive and engaging, and though there is a lot of reading, most of it is very interesting.",
    "I'm not sure, depending on their specific interest.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It does a great job of explaining the current state of our education system and different pathways into a career in education."
