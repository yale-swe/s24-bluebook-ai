   "comments": [
    "Great course, treat it as such. Do the work and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I would recommend it for politically minded students- some consulting and banking monkeys take this course for a credential, but it's most useful for those who plan on pursuing fields where strategy is actually applicable.",
    "This is the best course Yale has to offer. Apply if you have any interest at all.",
    "This course runs against the grain of most courses taught here. GS asks students to think big and construct, rather than to think small and deconstruct. In other courses, you'll write a final paper on a speciality of a speciality (\"The Trade of Small Pebbles in the Ming Dynasty Between 1450-1600\") or another paper on why Hobbes was actually wrong. GS, however, expects you to think big (grand, after all) and to carve a narrative for yourself based off some pretty cool readings on a whole host of topics. The course asks you to hold onto the threads that connect Augustus to Machiavelli to Lincoln to Bismarck.",
    "The Marshall Briefs can be a tad slow at times, but the second half of the course is fantastic -- very cool to apply the themes and lessons learned from the classics in a contemporary setting.",
    "If you can get into the class, please take it. It's a hugely valuable experience, and not one that you may be able to immediately appreciate. The things you learn and the things you take away from it only often show up later on in your awareness. You learn hard and soft skills and build wonderfully close relationships with both classmates and professors. There are lots of things where you'll have to take with a fistful of salt and many moments where you may feel terribly frustrated, but that's part of the learning experience and you'll come out net positive in the end for sure.",
    "absolutely do this, but do it if you know that you will care, that you'll produce work over semester& summer that's worthy of your time and the professors'. don't do this for the name. also: be nice to the other kids once you're in. helps a great deal, and opens up avenues to learn a ton.",
    "I would do my research before taking this course; there are both positive and deeply frustrating aspects. These graduate course reviews are also not available to students - can this be changed in the future?"

   "comments": [
    "This course influences how one views the world -- it applies to just about everything, in my opinion.",
    "It's extremely practical when thinking about military tactics and politics. The Professors are fantastic, and it deeply helped me understand the relationship between means and ends- all in all a great course and must take if given the opportunity",
    "Very much so!",
    "I definitely felt this course gave me good professional skills, and the opportunity to research and develop expertise in a subject I would not have otherwise looked at."
