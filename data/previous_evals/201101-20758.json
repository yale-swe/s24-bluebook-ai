    "Recommended for Ancient Phil. specialists and non-specialists alike, especially for those interested in philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychology, or ethics who want to learn more about some interesting perspectives that differ in important ways from modern ones but are nevertheless relevant to modern debates and don't seem anachronistic.Due to the methodology of the class, not recommended for those with no interest whatsoever in history of philosophy for its own sake (but those people have an impoverished view of philosophy and should branch out!)",
    "It was a course on Aristotle's and the Stoic's theories of emotion, which is a fascinating topic. If you decide to take it, though, you should definitely expect it to be more concerned with the accompanying metaphysics and nuances of the philosophical theories than with pursuing questions about how such theories of emotion might relate to our own contemporary understanding."
