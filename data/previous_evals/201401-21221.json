   "comments": [
    "Prof. Jakub is awesome! Take this course either for fun or to fulfill distributional requirements.",
    "If you are planning to be ee or eecs then you have to take it so obviously take it. If you want to get your feet wet with hardware I think this would be a good place to start.",
    "Yes, very good class. But only if you are an EE major.",
    "Yes. It's a good overview of computer engineering and gives a good look at how hardware and software come together.",
    "EENG 201 with Professor Szefer is a must-take. The class is taught well, the textbook is incredible (worth buying even if you don't take the class), and there are many resources available to you if you start to struggle. Professor Szefer goes out of his way to help his students succeed, and you will really learn a lot about low level computer design in this class.",
    "Unfortunately, I found EENG 201 to be a poor class with a great person\/professor and great material. Digital systems and Computer architecture are both very interesting topics and Professor Szefer is a brilliant guy with a heart of gold. He is always willing to go out of his way to help people, which I really respect. It was unfortunate that this was his first year teaching the class. You can tell that he is not very comfortable with lectures. He lacks clarity and his lectures are a bit unfocused. I wish that he focused more on problems; problems help students to understand the concepts more easily. In addition, the organization of the labs was clearly lacking, as we went from copying bits of VHDL code at the beginning of the year, to scrambling to actually understand the VHDL code and write several lines at the end, on our own. That being said, I think that this class has the potential to be a great one in another two to three years. Jakub will be a great professor if he continues to seek improvement in his lecturing style and if he tries to organize his class better.",
    "Yo, this is an awesome intro electrical engineering class. Work isn't too difficult, and if you're ever confused, Jakub is really responsive to emails. He's also really helpful during the labs. It's a good course to figure out how the very basic hardware side of computers work. Also if you can get Jakub that's the best because Jakub is a boss.",
    "A lot of work in the beginning, then in the end, the prof kind of just gave and gave us a lot of full point PSets. A stressful class, even though Jakub did put in solid effort and was cheerful all the time. But cheerfulness alone doesn't teach you EE.",
    "You're on your computer right now reading this, but tell me, do you have any idea how it works on the fundamental level? I know I didn't when I was thinking about taking this class. I didn't even have a clue where to starts. But, after EENG 201, you'll have a firm understanding of the basics of computer architecture. Professor Szefer was amazing and so helpful. Even though some of the topics are conceptually difficult, he'll guide you through it. The lab projects are fun and complement what you'll be doing in the classroom and on the homeworks. The tests are similar to the problem sets. You should definitely take this class. It's useful, engaging, interesting, and absolutely awesome. Take this class! I wish I could again.",
    "I would recommend it to those who are considering an EE major, doing a CS major (it's useful and fun to know the basics of how a computer works), and to those with any basic programming knowledge who just want an interesting elective.",
    "EE 201 is a good intro class, worth taking if you're interested in EE and the best introduction to the major I think. The professor is really nice and approachable, and the labs are interesting and you learn a lot. Make sure to keep up with the work, sadly there isn't much help available from TAs (at least when I took it).",
    "This course has great potential! I am sure there will be many refinements to it as this was its first year with a new professor. VHDL code (all of the labs are written in it) is a true pain to debug and write if you don't understand the language, which I hope more time will be devoted to in future years. The labs can be tedious but are quite satisfying the finish. My favorite part of the course is gradually building up layers of abstraction until you pretty much understand how basic computers work by the end of the course, which is so cool.",
    "A fascinating introduction to computer architecture. Easily the best freshman\/sophomore engineering class at Yale."
