    "Absolutely take this class!! However, if it's not taught by karen (which it sadly won't be), then I would change my recommendation to \"Absolutely shop this class!!\" It's an amazing topic and one of the best classes I've taken at yale, but karen nakamura made it as good as it was.",
    "The class is an exploration into many different queer and 'queer' identities and really pushes you to reconsider what the term 'queer' means and what it encompasses.",
    "Without a doubt one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and some of the better intellectual discussions I have had."
