The instructor was excellent. He responds to emails very fast and gives a detailed answer to any questions you might have. This show how he cares what he is teaching and wants the students to be able to understand very well.BEST COURSE AND BEST INSTRUCTOR EVER!!!!!!!!!!",
    "In 3 years at Yale, this was the best class I took. The teaching was incredibly clear and the course was well thought-out.",
    "This is the most valuable course for students interested in renewable energy finance. I am so glad to have met Daniel Gross--he's an incredible lecturer.",
    "FES should aim to have more rightly paced, clear, well categorized, well prepared courses\/lectures like this. The course was designed almost to perfection, and was phenomenally useful in learning.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Best class I've taken so far. Should be required for anyone who wants to go into renewable energy.",
    "Daniel Gross is a professional and through material covered was able to fill a lot of the gaps in the core. Very practical and useful information was taught. I wish it was a full semester!",
    "Fabulous class, really should be housed at SOM. Most practical application of SOM skills I've had so far.",
    "This is by far my most favourite course in all my time at SOM. It covered so so much in such a short time, and yet Mr. Gross taught with ease and clarity. I want to see this course remain in SOM. It gets a 10\/10 from me.",
    "As an undergraduate, I felt that the course was still accessible to someone who did not have an incredible background in project finance, but also had the ability to definitely challenge those students who have had an extensive background in the industry. Overall, the course was very applicable and Professor Gross is very responsive to student requests and questions.",
    "Great class; very practical and important for all students interested in this field.",
    "More modeling, less legal reading.",
    "Excellent class taught by outstanding instructor.",
    "One of the all-time best courses I took at Yale during my SOM career. Daniel's lectures were clear & engaging and his commitment to our learning process was made evident by the huge effort he put into his teaching. The financial modeling skills we learned could be applied to any number of other disciplines and his approach to teaching the material was far better than any I have previously seen at FES or SOM.",
    "This was tied for the best class i've taken at FES and Yale. Daniel Gross is simply put an amazing lecturer and teacher.",
    "This has been a truly exceptional course in every sense of the word. It is meticulously well designed and prepared, with assignments that build logically on concepts from the lecture. Daniel is an exemplar of professionalism, compassion, and dedication to his students.",
    "This course is for student interested in energy, but also any student interested in using finance as a tool. You will learn project finance in this course. I will not work in energy and found this course to be an exceptional way to learn. Daniel Gross is a FANTASTIC professors. All FES teachers should be required to sit in on 30min of his class to see what it means to teach. He is incredibly prepared and thoughtful about course design and instruction. Truly a wonderful teacher.",
    "This was the most rigorous, analytical, challenging, and overall beneficial course from my time at Yale this year. It incorporated many of the themes and skills taught in the SOM core, and challenged me in a way no other elective or subsequent course has. The fact that it was taught at FES was surprising, but the way the course was taught and the optional modes of difficulty for the final provided a fantastic way of tailoring it to specific interests and degrees of comfort with finance and accounting. Daniel Gross was a fantastic teacher in and outside of class, responding to emails in a timely manner, providing mentorship for career decisions and industries to pursue, and coming to every 3 hour class with excitement and an incredible amount of knowledge. I took this course this semester, somewhat overloading my schedule, because I realize that as a professional Daniel is not guaranteed to teach this course next year, nor is it guaranteed to be offered. The course was an invaluable experience, and played an instrumental role in helping me secure my summer internship. In addition, there was a huge amount of interest, with students exceeding the amount of desk space in Sages largest classroom (50+). This class size, and the intricacy of homeworks and exams, was managed by two TAs. I cannot imagine how overworked they must have been and continue to be, but they always responded to emails and held office hours. I would consider it a huge blow to both schools, and a great loss to the students if this course was not offered next year, and if the number of TAs and support from each institution was not expanded. There is a demonstrated excess of demand, and as more students at both schools begin to focus on energy there should be more courses of this nature offered."

    "The course was perfectly paced - not too slow nor too fast. Their was little repetition - only of concepts which take time to sink in. The course was very relevant to real life, and current affairs. The instructor was very humble, understanding, and taught in almost perfect manner. Every class was a complete use of student's time and attention.",
    "Walking through modelling techniques and slowly building up a very complex and sophisticated model, incorporating financial statements, which I had previously had only a basic grasp of.",

    "The modeling, the exercises, class slides, lectures, discussion, all of the above!",
    "Instructor and material",
    "Practical skills honed by real world experience.",
    "Getting access to real world project and getting to use the contract material to create a financial model. I loved it.",
    "- The course was really practical and we got to learn a lot of tools and concepts that I am sure I will use in my career.",
    "EVERYTHING. I'm running out of time to write a review but: the homeworks showed us what it's really like to do project finance, from the contracts to the models. It was super challenging, but the most \"real\" experience that's similar to a workplace that I've had so far at Yale.",
    "Daniel is a practitioner who teaches project finance from his personal experience and this is an invaluable asset to the students. I very much enjoyed learning about real-life examples in the industry. I also greatly benefited from the assingments and am grateful for the opportunity to acquire project finance skill in school.",
    "This course is perfectly suited to students interested in any aspect of energy, let alone the financial knowledge it imparts. It was extremely well thought-out and designed, provided clarity to an esoteric and specialized field, and was engaging throughout!",
    "This class is extremely practical. It is the only class I have experienced at FES or SOM that teaches Excel skills well, which is really important. I also really enjoyed using a single case study as the focus for the entire class. It allowed students to come away really understanding an issue in depth. The lectures were very engaging despite somewhat dry material. Daniel always explained things in a way that was very clear, and I enjoyed attending class.",
    "Practical financial modeling skills, the dedication of the teaching team",
    "the fun and engaging way of professor Daniel Gross. He has an amazing skill to explain in a clearly, simple and cohesive way how project finance works. Also I highly appreciated his message to the students that this is an opportunity for learning and gaining skills.",
    "The most valuable aspects of the course were as much in the practical learning of good excel modeling techniques as the concepts of project finance, especially coming from the MBA program. It's actually shocking that this was the best modeling course that I had in the program.",
    "Interesting, relevant, practical readings and assignments. Best-practices with Excel was fantastic.",
    "- The instructor: engaging, lucid teaching style, great personal anecdotes, extremely responsive & committed to learning process - Practical skils (Excel modeling, finance & debt sculpting, legal contracts)",
    "The incredibly relevant material, the clear lectures, the homework assignments that purposefully reinforced class material.",
    "The material is relevant to anyone planning on working in the energy industry. I learned an immense amount in just a few classes.",
    "Learnt certain practical aspects of project finance",
    "the instruction and subject matter",
    "This course was extremely well-organized, which, despite the fact that the material was dense and the pace was relatively fast, made it possible to learn a lot in just a handful of class sessions. Daniel Gross also had a good lecture style.",

    "i wish we had more time for this course. it only run for few weeks.",
    "The assignments are intense, and it would be nice to have a weekly TA session to review concepts covered in lecture.",
    "More TAs to assist with lagging students, more discussion sessions. Actually, the course can totally use a proper section instead of just office hours.",
    "My only suggestion would be to swap one of the legal contract assignments for another required excel model update. Even though Professor Gross repeatedly stressed that we should be submitting updates, having just one extra required submission could make a big difference in ensuring people don't wait to try and squeeze in the final model\/memo in just a few days.",
    "As distributed generation becomes more and more important I think the class would benefit from the addition of distributed generation finance.",
    "Would be nice to cover some aspects of innovation related to finance or renewable technology.",
    "Investor Committee Memo group assignment was not great because we were thrown into a group of strangers right at the end of semester, when we were busiest. No one knows each other and everyone has very busy schedules with exams and job interviews.",
    "Having worked in project finance before and planing to go back in the same industry, I honestly dont believe that there is any way in which the course can be improved. If the class was for the full semester perhaps we would get to spend more time with some aspects that we had to overlook.",
    "It should be a full semester! We'd get even more out of it! Dan Gross is the best! He deserves more TA's!!",
    "It will be wonderful and really appropriate to have this class as a full semester class or at least have a section or meet twice a week. The material to be covered is a lot, it is academically dense and complex, thus requires more time to digest. The teaching crew would also benefit from more help ( more TAs) who can answer questions and hold office hours.",
    "More institutional support, increase number of credits to match workload, have the course for longer than half the semester",
    "Very short time frame. Thus, for some of the material we went over them very quickly. In particular the last session with the developer (class speaker). That too fast to follow.",
    "More modeling, not wait until the final assignment to do so.",
    "Would be nicer if class was smaller, or at least in a room with better acoustics than Bowers.",
    "Honestly, none. It was pretty perfect.",
    "Instead of focusing exclusively on practical aspects, I think it would be great to have some conceptual discussions Quality of TAs was very low",
    "This course was very successful in large part b\/c of the TA support. I imagine that it might be difficult to find such qualified and dedicated TAs in the future.",
    "Room was not the best. Several rooms at SOM would be much better, although I realize that may not be possible since it is a FES course."
