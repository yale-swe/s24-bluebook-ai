    "Vicki's experience is vast and her anecdotes are illustrative and often entertaining. Her attention to the current conversations about EDI were extremely helpful in keeping the class informed and open-minded not only about how Vicki's career has gone, but where the field is going in best practices. Sometimes we spent too much time gathering details on the white board before jumping into the difficult conversations - I think we can trust that we have a grasp of the details and their complexities and just jump into learning from Vicki's wisdom!",
