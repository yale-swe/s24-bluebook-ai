    "I learned more principle knowledge of Korean. I learned how to articulate myself in more conventional ways and how to hold conversations about myself and simple topics.",
    "I developed my L2 Korean Language skills. We also learned some Korean culture.",
    "Further learned basic Korea. We continued to learn vocabulary, and we also learned more verb conjugations and verb tenses. In 120, we focused even more on listening, especially listening Korean at natural speeds. We also developed writing and speaking.",
    "Increased my vocabulary and improved my grammar in basic Korean."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: a lot of practice speaking with peers in Korean during class, teacher provides very detailed feedback on homeworks and exams that point our your spelling \/ grammar errors Weaknesses: Sometimes the teacher (Professor Choi) was not very clear with her expectations for assignments or due dates. The due dates and deadlines were written on the syllabus but dates were not followed closely. Also I felt like class time was sometimes useless.",
    "I think the biggest weakness of the course is its rigorous emphasis on writing -- I felt like I was not as compelled to learned, as other methods of learning motivates me. I also think the class would be really uncomfortable for a queer student, there's a lot of emphasis on gender norms and what kind of boyfriend\/girlfriend you want.",
    "Strengths: Good textbook. Good pace. Weaknesses: Not enough independent speaking. Could use more videos of Korean being spoken in real life.",
    "The professor is very good at relating Korean grammar to English in order to better facilitate our learning. The quizzes everyday ensure that we build our vocabulary and that we keep the language in practice.",
    "Strength: -homework was helpful and improved my writing skills -in class activities reinforced key concepts -week schedule allowed me to plan ahead Weakness -questions were not always answered clearly -due dates for projects were hazy and would often change randomly with no future notice",
    "The curriculum seemed slow in terms of the vocabulary, as we learned many of the words in the first semester of Korean. Many of the grammar structures were also repeated from last semester. We practiced a lot of listening and speaking which was very helpful.",
    "Choi SSN does not upload anything other than audio onto canvas. I wish she would have uploaded our grades in order to facilitate how we received feedback. Also, uploading her lectures instead of only writing on the board could have been useful."

    "Would recommend if student is seeking an easy language course, however be advised that there are not as many sections in Korean as other, more popular, language courses so scheduling can be kind of tricky.",
    "Not unless you really want to learn Korean a lot more!",
    "Yes, this is a good continuation of KREN 110.",
    "I would recommend Korean to anyone! The department is small so you get really close to the professors! They really want you to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to learn Korean and need fo fulfill a language requirement.",
    "As long as you are motivated to learning Korean, I would recommend this course. If you are not self-motivated, it may be difficult to get the most out of this class."
