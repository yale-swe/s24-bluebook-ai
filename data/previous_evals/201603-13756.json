   "comments": [
    "I think the format of this class was awesome in its combining technical, artistic, theoretical, practical, and dramaturgical instruction. It was a good, very basic introduction to theatrical lighting.",
    "The most valuable part of the class was the lighting practicals.",
    "The practicals were very informative, the class itself was rather unhelpful. I certainly do not feel as if I can communicate with a lighting designer at all at this point.",
    "I begin to understand the world of light design and it's complexity. I thought the most helpful class where the ones in the theater when we get to light a scene in the space with the set and the light plot. it got me really excited.",
    "Spending time in the theater lab was productive in learning from hands on experience. Working in pairs was really helpful when learning the basics."

    "This class is tediously rudimentary to anyone who has handled a theatrical lighting fixture before. Obviously students enter the program with different prior experiences, but it's very frustrating to spend such a great deal of time on basics that many students have already covered in their undergrad and professional careers. The class felt very disorganized. Assignments were often unclear. Our professors and TAs often seemed confused about what came next. Having professors that are working professionals is incredibly valuable because it keeps the content relevant, but it's extraordinarily frustrating to lose a professor for weeks at a time when the substitutes are not well-integrated. We often times repeated in-class exercises because substitute professors weren't aware of what we had already accomplished or what we were supposed to do next.",
    "I would suggest we learn a lot of basic skills that I belive would help inform a lighting design. I believe it's necessary to learn what a lighting instrument is and how it works. The early pioneers of lighting design developed instruments by learning how light and relectors worked, changing our world forever. I don't see that same drive to understand basic principles or encouragement to surpass them\/ create new principles. But it's only been one semester.",
    "More practicals in class rather than assignments out of class. It is hard enough getting everyone in the same place at the same time doing practicals together and being guided might be more effective.",
    "I feel like we are constantly going over and over on the same topic and not going forward. It makes the class a bit boring. In addition I feel like I don't know enough about the light board. I also think it would help if we would bring or Robert would bring examples of interesting designs and we would talk about it and understand how they where made. I think examples of what can be achieved with lighting will make us more engaged and enthusiastic. right now, to spend a hole semester on the first act of mice and man is really boring",
    "We spent WAY too long on a single concept- hanging and focusing lights- while we spent only ONE class in the entire semester on looking at groundplans and sections to figure out where to hang lights. We didn't spent any time working on light plots or any other paperwork needed when designing.",
    "Prompts for the lighting practical were way too vague. As a first year non-lighting designer, I needed more information before actually work on the design. Lots of times we spent hours on the assignments just to hear professors criticize us being wrong in every way. I honestly didn't feel I could learn lighting design from the practicum... I believe we need one lighting designer in every group."

    "The class needs more structure. A lot of the people in the class have never seen a plot, intstument, and or board. We skip over a lot of basic information about lighting instruments, why they work, how they work, who developed them, the progress we've made, who are the major lighting designers, why they designed the way they did, what the major theories are about lighting design, how to operate a board, what a dimmer is, why and how it works. Instead we dive into designing a play and doing practicals with no real deal what we'really doing. It kind of baffles me that we don't have an entire couple of classes about designers like Richard Pilbrow and lighting theory. I almost feel that should be the entire first semester. Then when we have formulated ideas about what lighting designing is and can start to plot those ideas. The best exemple I have is David Budries sound class. It's extremely thought out and structured. Day 1 what is sound, (wave length, frequency, pitch, & tone) and then we go through practical examples of that in class. Which is different from being thrown into our lighting practicals.",
    "I feel like the half hour talk at the end of the class (about the plays) feels very awkward. I wish there was another structure to get the conversation going.",
    "We should spend more time working the light board in the lab. We should spend more time learning how to make light plots and how to determine which lights and what angles would be best to achieve certain looks before getting into color."
