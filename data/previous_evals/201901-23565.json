   "comments": [
    "It does what it says it's going to do. If you're taking MATH 111, you probably don't love math. This course is not going to change your mind but John Hall really tries to make it as painless as possible",
    "Strengths: Great introductory course. Work-load was manageable and classes were engaging. Cons: More in-class activities (handouts, group work, etc.)",
    "More opportunity to get one on one meetings with the professors and more opportunity to get a more help with the material.",
    "The strengths are that this class furthers my critical thinking skills, however this course is very challenging. What balances that out is that there are many opportunities to get tutors, go to office hours, as well as meet with professors. John Hall does an amazing job of making sure each student feels as though they have the proper help they needed.",
    "I don't like math, nor am I good at it, but I felt that I was as engaged in the class as I personally could have been, and the structure of the class facilitated my learning experience. However, I do not think the weekly workshops should be mandatory.",
    "Well taught, fair tests and good review. The daily quizzes were annoying at times though, I'd rather just have those as practice problems in class",
    "weakness - had troubles understanding some of the theories as they seemed overcomplicated but got a firm grip once we started doing questions",
    "This course has a good sense of support between students and ULA's as well as professors. I would like to examine some materials more closely. For example, we spend lots of time on the pure methodology for solving\/deriving, but we breeze through the application problems, which are often more difficult to fully understand.",
    "With the help of ULA office hours and professors, they provide a really strong support system and help you do well. The short quizzes every class period helped you gauge how you were doing.",
    "The strengths of the class come from the professor and some of the ULAs. They were very passionate about making sure people understood the course material and passed the class. I could change the quizzes at the beginning of class because I feel like they don't much in terms of reviewing the previous classes materials and just stress people out. I would also change how the course ends with 2D and 3D density problems because it's something very difficult and needs to have more in-class time dedicated to it. Also, making it easier for people to see what their current grade in the course is, as opposed to just problem set average, would be a great help."

   "comments": [
    "If you're just doing it for the QR credit, absolutely not. If you need some higher math for some courses you want to take, definitely.",
    "Highly recommend for students looking for an intro into calculus. John Hall and Itziar do an incredible job of walking you through difficult concepts.",
    "No. The better thing to do is take math 112.",
    "Yes as long as they are willing to put in a lot of time and a lot of extra work in order to do well.",
    "Yes. For a student who needs QR credits or needs math as a major requirement but doesn't like doing math, like me, I think this class is perfect.",
    "Yes, it's well taught and theres a lot of support and help you can get.",
    "With a previous knowledge of most of the topics the questions and application was relatively easy, however having to learn the theory of it made my understanding harder as I was unable to use the methods that I learnt in high school",
    "Yes, as a student with a weak background in Calculus, this course taught me what I needed to know without me feeling as though I was falling behind.",
    "Yes. It is a great course where you'll definitely pushed but will still feel very comfortable and ready for success!",
    "It's a great introduction to calculus at Yale.",
    "If somebody doesn't have a strong math background then yes."
