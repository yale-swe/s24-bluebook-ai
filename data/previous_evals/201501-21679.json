   "comments": [
    "Yes. Really cool topic taught in a stress-free environment (no problem sets, open note exams), if you're interested in biomaterials!",
    "Great class overall! I learned a lot. The class was pretty chill in that there was minimal work. Themis is both funny and has interesting comments to offer. I took this as a premed student, and it was a nice variation from my usual courseload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is very manageable.",
    "This is a course focused on the biology of implants and organ replacements, so if you're interested in either, take it! It's helpful to have had Biomaterials (BENG 434) but definitely not necessary. The format of the class is all powerpoint lectures, no psets, two midterms, and a final, all of which are open note. If you don't know that much about lab techniques, it might be a bit more challenging since Prof Kyriakides mostly goes over actual studies and data. Good elective for the biomolecular track of BME!",
    "Good course if you want to learn about immunological response to many of the novel ideas currently regarding biomaterials.",
    "Open note, non-cumulative exams, but you definitely need to understand the readings fully and take notes in class.",
    "BENG 435 covers a general overview of the issues that come with biomaterial implementation in the body as well as some specific cases, like brain electrodes and tissue engineering. The material itself was pretty interesting, and Professor Kyriakides did an admirable job of being enthusiastic and keeping people engaged at 9am with giving out candy for asking and answering questions. The workload is also pretty light -- a few readings that are completely covered in the lecture, two open-note midterms, and an open-note non-cumulative final. The grading is a bit harsh, but if you go through the material thoroughly (I had two other friends in the class and we combined our notes and went through them in detail the night before each test, which was super helpful) you'll be fine. This is probably one of the better BME electives, especially if you're interested in the material and want a lighter workload.",
    "I highly recommend this class to a fellow student who is interested in medical devices and biological processes related to various devices. It was very informative and engaging, and the workload was pretty light compared to other engineering classes since there aren't weekly problem sets.",
    "Kyriakides is a good lecturer and starts out really engaging with discussions of where biomaterials went wrong in case study form. This class really increases your awareness of biomaterial-tissue interactions, the wound healing, the foreign body response, and how proper studies are conducted. The majority of the research is really current which is great. Major downside, it's 9am and it can be hard to be awake and engaged.",
    "Definitely take this course. It's pretty chill, and the material is very interesting. Great lectures!",
    "Not a lot of work. Tests are easy if you take good notes"
