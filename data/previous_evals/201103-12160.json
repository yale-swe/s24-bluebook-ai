   "comments": [
    "This is a helpful broad overview of research methods. Professor Adams is very sweet and friendly, and she's quite accessible to help you develop your final research proposal. This class is useful as a junior sociology major because it gets you thinking about your senior thesis very early and gives you time to develop your project. The 9am class time can be rough, I wish I was more awake to match Professor Adams in her perpetual enthusiasm.",
    "Preparation for senior thesis. 9am class is awful, but Julia Adams is so nice you almost don't mind the early mornings.",
    "Its a requirement but the teacher is really nice and although material can be dry at points, the teacher makes it enjoyable. Not that much work",
    "Take this class if you have to for your major (sociology) but it doesn't teach much. It's an easy credit if you're already writing a proposal for your senior thesis or have written one already. If you need an adviser, Professor Adams is the nicest, sweetest, most dedicated Professor you'll probably ever find. She cares a lot about her students, responds quickly to email and is overall a great person to know. However, the course material is fairly boring and you'll learn a lot more from the professor than you will from the course itself.The course does not require much work outside of a critical analysis of a senior thesis and a final proposal.",
    "This was a very strong course, given the ground it needed to cover. Gave a solid overview of each method of analysis while providing a range of examples, many of which were sure to be relevant to the personal research of the students.That said, this is not going to be the most exciting course you'll ever take. You're probably going to take it because it's required, or because you have a big research project on the horizon. Accept the fact that it's not going to be interesting all of the time, and learn how to take advantage of the amazing resources that the course DOES offer.",
    "I am so serious when I say this: do not take this course unless you are a Sociology major in which case, you have to. I understand that in the long run it might (will) help me research, but it is just so painful. Pay attention to the early lectures on the 4 modes of inquiry and follow what Professor Adams wants from the assignments to a T and you'll be fine.",
    "Required class, the midterm's not bad, and the proposals are fun to write. The beginning is not necessarily as exciting, but just wait for the end! Getting to hear your classmates' projects makes it all worth it. Liz and Prof Adams are also really helpful in writing the proposal and figuring out all the little details.",
    "SOCY 160 is really great for getting started planning your senior thesis if you're a sociology (or similar social science) major. Getting a broad and basic survey of research methods helps clarify the kind of research you want to do and gets you started understanding how to do it. The final project is a research proposal, which is super helpful. The professor and TF are very kind and approachable.",
    "Pretty easy class, not the most stimulating.",
    "Great course! Very useful for planning senior thesis topics and getting a start on your senior project. Prof. Adams and Liz (TA) were both excellent instructors!",
    "If you don't know anything about methods, good overview, otherwise boring and not useful.",
    "This class is really helpful to anyone wanting to do their own research. It gives you all the material and things to think about when you're devising your own, and I would highly recommend it for anyone doing a research-based senior project (even if, like me, you're not a sociology major). Definitely worth it.",
    "Sociology 160 is a required course for the sociology major. There are many valuable lessons to be learned from this course, especially if you plan on doing in-depth research for your senior essay. It is difficult to make a methods course interesting, but it is definitely valuable to read past senior essays on a variety of topics and past proposals. In terms of workload, there is reading for every meeting, a midterm in-class written exam, and the final paper is a research proposal. If you do it right, you will be working on the proposal all semester and finishing it up at the end will be no problem. Start thinking about your topic early and make sure to be working on the proposal throughout the semester!",
    "This course was very helpful for me. I had very little background in research and this class laid it all out for me. It was great to get a step up on my senior thesis.",
    "The really exciting (or scary) part about this class is you get to start thinking about your senior project\/thesis and this class gives you the tools for thinking about how to start researching for it. A lot of the work is then outside of the required readings as you try and figure out an interesting topic. Sometimes the course itself can get a bit tedious, especially in the early mornings, but Prof. Adams is fantastic. Try to meet with her as much as possible to start thinking about your ideas and narrowing down a topic.It's mostly sociology majors since it's required, but others took it in order to learn more about research methods. It's probably best to try and take it junior year in preparation for the senior proj."
