    "Heavy workload that'll introduce you to tons of awesome historians and concepts. Take this during a light semester and you could get a ton out of it. It'll also require a lot of self-motivation and interest. It would almost be better to not even have class, just the reading list to do with as you pleased.",

    "This is where the class really shined(shone?). I've yet to take a class with as awesome a reading list as this one. We only read geniuses of the discipline. I fully plan on going back over the readings at some point, hopefully before I'm thirty. It was a great summation of how people have approached international history through every era of historiography. I do hope I can retain something from it."
