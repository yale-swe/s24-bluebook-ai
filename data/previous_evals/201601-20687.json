    "Not with Sabl.",
    "Spring DS H&P is more political thought than history. It would be great if you are into political science.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course. The importance of these modern political texts is staggering, and should not be missed by anyone with interest in canonical political thought.",
    "This class is an intensive survey of the modern great works of historical and political thought in the western canon. I would fully recommend it to another student because it provides an excellent background for any field in the humanities.",
    "I would recommend taking the course by another instructor. I think DS has many wonderful professors and the great readings could have been much more accessible and instructive if taught by a different professor."
