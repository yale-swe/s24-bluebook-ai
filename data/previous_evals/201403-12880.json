   "comments": [
    "A highly recommended course! Professor Cadieu is an incredible teacher and the fact that we read some very modern texts in French literature makes the reading all the more interesting and exciting. During the semester, you cover different modern texts relating to the topic of social mobility and social classes in France, while also analyzing textual and stylistic components of the different works. The readings are also complemented with theoretical texts, whose subjects range from social mobility, to education, to economics and even language. The class is a bit of work in terms of reading and the final paper, but definitely worth the work!",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great. Awesome. It is mostly reading\/film watching, then talking about what you read or saw, often connecting it to real-world problems. It is not only a great environment to speak French in, but also a literary analysis that feels useful and productive and incredibly interesting. I won't say I fell in love with every book we read, but the conversations we had made all the reading worth my while, in a way that very often made me excited to write about it. The small class size was great--if you can take a class with six people in it, do it. Especially if it is taught by Mme. Cadieu, because oh-my-god will it blow your mind (she's the greatest; see above). If you have the chance to take this course, you absolutely should. So, yeah, I'd recommend it to another student."
