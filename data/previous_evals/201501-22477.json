    "I highly recommend this course. You have to keep up with the material for the quizzes, but the topics are fascinating and the volume is manageable.",
    "MCDB 205 is one of those courses I highly recommend if you're premed. the weekly quizzes are a pain, but it'll give you the knowledge you need in this area for the MCATs. plus the quizzes only help you stay on top of things for the final, so that's a plus for me.",
    "Amazing, amazing class. Every MCDB major and premed should at least consider taking it. That said, it's not easy -- the weekly quizzes require real preparation, so don't fall behind! I recommend (at the minimum) reading the chapters and answering the objectives given in the handouts before each quiz. The upside of the quizzes is that your grade is really spread out, and you drop 3! Overall I liked them a lot better than having a few midterms. This class will leave you with a really solid knowledge of cell bio (so critical to the field of biology!) and the confidence to tackle upper-level biology courses. Professor Pollard is wonderful (he literally wrote the textbook!), the TFs are wonderful, and everything is extremely organized and fair. It was my favorite bio class I've taken at Yale! TAKE IT!",
    "A great choice for an MCDB core class.",
    "Well, you are going to read a lot of answers about how much work this class required, and how difficult it was. I, surprisingly did not experience this at all! But, more about that later...let's talk logistics first. This class covered everything possible about cell biology, from the molecular details of chromatin, membrane pumps, and kinesins to the components of muscle contractions and IgCAMs. We had a quiz at 9AM each Tuesday on the material learned during the previous week (actually, it usually started a little before 9AM, so get there early!) which made the material much more manageable than if we had had midterms. Those quizzes were composed of two questions based on the week's worth of material; we were asked to pick only one to answer. In total we had 12 quizzes, and were allowed to drop 3. My advice, don't waste those needlessly. I skipped three because I was sleepy (it's at 9AM, after all!), and I spent the rest of the semester terrified that I was going to sleep in or bomb one of the quizzes. That said, Pollard is a fantastic teacher, and he really does care about his students! I would highly suggest attending his office hours; I didn't and I still regret it. As far as the difficulty of the course, that is where my opinion will most likely differ from that of the other students. I thought it was pretty darn easy. All I did was study the relevant handouts (Pollard gives us detailed handouts of all the material covered in class) the night before, and I essentially got 10s out of 10 on all of the quizzes. Then again, the difficulties you will face in this class will highly depend on your background. I am a Physics and MB&B double major who is a junior and therefore has already taken biochem I and II, neurobio, and multiple upper level biochem and biophysics courses, all of which helped a lot in this class. If you are a freshman or sophomore who has not had these courses, you will most likely find it a lot harder.",
    "Tom Pollard is a saint and the class is amazing. Quiz every week instead of tests and they're all very fair. Take it.",
    "Incredible depth considering the breadth of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It's a lot of work but it is very worthwhile.",
    "MCDB 205 is an incredible class--you come out of it feeling like you have really covered most parts of the cell, an incredible complex unit, but also have a sense of the vast amount of material that is still waiting to be discovered! Quizzes are a great way to keep up with the material--don't be daunted by it, just make sure to look over the material on a regular basis!",
    "Definitely take it if you're at all interesting in cell biology. Understand that it's a heavy commitment but definitely worth all of the knowledge in the end!",
    "OKAY THIS IS YOUR FAIR WARNING: THIS CLASS IS A LOT OF WORK. Like most Yale students, I have a tendency to procrastinate on things. Procrastinate on your other classes, but please don't do it for this. Do the readings ahead of time or right after class and don't leave it to Monday night before the weekly quiz. ALSO MAKE A STUDY GROUP THEY'RE HELPFUL. ALSO DON'T TAKE WITH 4.5 OTHER CREDITS THAT WAS A BAD IDEA. You will feel very frustrated during the class that maybe quiz grades aren't going the way you want, or maybe that Professor Pollard covered too much material in that class period. And you will feel this frustrated feeling all the way through the final. But when you finish studying Lecture 26 for the final, you'll realize that you've learned an incredible amount of material, and for that you should be proud of yourself and amazed that each cell in our body is so complicated.",
    "A lot of material to learn but very very informative. Naturally if majoring in Bio need to take it. The class itself was a little boring at times but the packets and slideshows contain all the material that will be tested. The quiz were very manageable but are weekly which could wear you down.",
    "I would recommend this class to MCDB majors. There is a lot of information to know, and keeping up on the information by going through the handout is helpful.",
    "If you're up for a challenge, take this class. You will learn so much about everything related to cells (think BIOL 102 in much greater detail), which is necessary if you plan on doing research later on. MCDB 205 was very very hard--every Tuesday you have a quiz, so plan on spending the entirety of Monday and some of Sunday cramming for hours on end--but the weekly quiz system is good because you never fall behind on the material. The grading is pretty fair (although occasionally on one or two quizzes, it felt nitpicky) but you quickly learn how to study for the quizzes...go through the slides, know the study guide back-and-forth (oh yeah, they print out a study guide for every student, every single lecture!), and use the textbook as a supplement. MCDB 205 is great because you are being taught by the person who wrote the textbook you'll use, and Professor Pollard literally knows the most up-to-date information on pretty much every topic in cell bio. Given how fast this field is discovering new things, being up-to-date is a HUGE plus. TL;DR Cell bio is hard and will be your main class of the semester, but if you're willing to put in the work, you won't regret taking it.",
    "Amazing. I really loved the material covered in this class. There is so much information that is covered which makes it very difficult, but it is presented really well, so it is was manageable. There are weekly quizzes that cover 3-4 chapters. While it is only quiz length, the amount of material covered is that of a test. It's a lot, but definitely worth it. I learned so much and would recommend this class to everyone that wants a good biology class.",
    "Take it if you need to but it's a good class. Teaches you a lot in a short time",
    "This is a wonderful course. Anyone who's looking to develop a foundation for research or clinical work in biology must have an understanding of the concepts taught in Cell Biology. Make sure you sit in the first few rows if Thomas Pollard (colloquially a.k.a. Tommy P) is still teaching this course. He tends to speak softly, but the words coming from his mouth are pure gold for biology students. The course is really well structured as well, as you'll find the weekly quizzes are great for breaking up the immense breadth of material into digestible fragments. Definitely take this course with Tommy P. He's a great guy and his eagerness to learn is contagious. You'll love him.",
    "Take it if you are an MCDB major. You learn a lot just because you end up memorizing so much information in order to do well on the quizzes. THe format is pretty standard pre med so if that is what you are looking for then even better. Even if you are looking for a more concept based course, if you are an MCDB or MBB major it is still pretty useful information.",
    "Take it. You'll learn a lot.",
    "Overall, it was a great class! I would definitely recommend it to other students especially to fill the MCDB requirement. I learned a lot and enjoyed it a lot.",
    "This class can be as difficult as you want it to be. If you get caught up in all of the detail and the memorization aspects, it will suck up a lot of time. If you decide to go for overarching principles instead, you'll have an easier time.",
    "Cell bio is awesome! A must take for any MCDB major (or anyone else interested in the super cool workings of cells!) You definitely have to put in a lot of work, but the material is fascinating and I felt like I had learned so much by the end of the course. Pollard and the other lecturers are great and really know the material. The weekly quizzes are helpful in keeping up with the material, and I felt like I got in a rhythm with studying for them so they weren't so bad after a while. Take it!!!",
    "A good biology course in which you will learn a lot, but be prepared to put in a lot of work.",
    "MCDB 205 is a comprehensive, challenging course. It teaches the fundamentals of biology and is a class that I would recommend to all biology majors. The class itself is taught by three professors, all of whom are outstanding in their fields and very approachable. Professor Pollard is the main instructor and teaches most of the lectures. Make sure to sit in the front of OML 202, since sitting in the back might make it difficult to hear the lectures. There are weekly quizzes every Tuesday during the first 15 or so minutes of class. The quizzes cover material from the Tuesday and Thursday prior to quiz day and most material is gathered from the chapter review notes. This year, the questions were very conceptual and required thought mapping and analysis as opposed to simple recall. It is very helpful to form a study group to answer the review questions at the end of each module prior to the quiz, as many of the quiz questions may stem from the review questions in one way or another. The TFs for this class are also very helpful - they host weekly discussion sections and my TF in particular made very detailed powerpoints with review information and questions that he emailed to students after section. Material wise, this class provides the foundation for all biology and covers everything from cell biology techniques (microscopy, assays, etc) to signaling pathways and cell cycle, which encompasses all of the information learned leading up to those final lectures. All in all, a hard class but worth taking - I learned a lot!",
    "A lot of material. Do not take this class with another heavy coursework class. Huge volume of material coverage and an average MCDB class. Weekly quizzes are generously easy for the most part but the final is difficult (as expected for memorization-based classes over an entire semester). Tom Pollard is a boring lecturer and I find that there's really no reason to go to lecture except to take the quizzes unless you're genuinely captivated by cell biology (which you should be! great stuff). For the average college student though, the study guides mostly capture everything, especially since it's at 9 in the morning.",
    "Cell Bio is a lot of material - we covered 45 chapters over the course of a semester - but that absolutely should not dissuade you from taking it. It is an excellent, comprehensive review of cell biology, and is fascinating because it goes into a lot of detail about how and why everything works. For example, if you didn't fully understand action potentials after Biology 102, you will after you take this class. You will know exactly how they are initiated and terminated using several different types of channels, how they propagate from one cell to the next, and how they can initiate a response in different types of muscle cell. Each of those topics is covered in a separate lecture, and by the end of the year, you can put it all together. The class is a lot of work, but if you put in the work, it is not that hard to do well. Professor Pollard says at the beginning of the year that the goal of the class is \"to learn to swim in an infinite sea of knowledge and ignorance\", as it is impossible, even for a professional, to remember everything in cell biology. To keep you up to speed, there is a quiz every week on two previous lectures. The quizzes (60% of your grade) consist of two multi-part questions, and you only have to answer one of your choosing - so if you can't remember one topic, you can still get full credit. In addition, the lowest three of the twelve quizzes are dropped in case you have an off week (or three). The final (40%) is six quizzes put together, and while you can't drop any of those, your quiz grade will tend to boost your final grade. To do well, work together! Study groups are key, and the professor encourages them by not curving the students against each other - so if other people do well, it doesn't hurt you at all. Unlike Bio 102, however, you WILL have to read the textbook - the professor wrote it, and it is a very useful review of the material. He technically won't test you on anything that's only in the textbook, but sometimes I didn't understand one or two concepts from class until I read it. This class was a challenge, but absolutely worth it - so far, it has been my favorite class at Yale. If you're really into biology, definitely take it!",
    "It's a good class. Make study guides as you go along for each quiz. This will prepare you for final. My advice: study the material in the quizes: this is what the professor thought was important. Learn this material well. Then, move along and find other topics that may be important based on the quiz style. Usually processes and mechanisms. Good luck. Study hard, you'll have to.",
    "If you have some bio background (the intro bio sequence is sufficient), then you will get a lot out of this class! It DOES require a lot of studying EVERY week.",
    "The class is interesting if you are into cells in general. You get to go into extreme detail about the overall cellular processes that are usually ignored in similar classes. Preparing for a quiz every week can sometimes be challenging, because a lot of time has to be put into learning the concepts. However, there are no p sets or other midterms and the few hours a week one needs to prepare for the quiz is well worth it. Overall, the class is manageable if you keep up, and very enjoyable.",
    "Cell Biology is an amazing class. Period. Professors Pollard, King, and Bhamanyar were all great lecturers and extremely knowledgeable. The class runs really smoothly and they've worked out all the logistical kinks so you know exactly what to expect. Pretty much each week you get a comprehensive printed out packet of notes and review questions to take notes on during lecture, and the corresponding book chapters. Once a week there is a quiz on the material covered in the two previous lectures, and studying for the quizzes (choice between two application based questions) requires you to review notes and read the book, so it's kind of like preparing for the exam as you go along. Section is pretty helpful for studying for the quizzes too. The class is a LOT of work, but they make it very clear what you need to do to succeed, and as long as you do it, you will. At the end of the semester you will definitely have a better understanding of how cells work - you literally cover the entire textbook, which Tom Pollard wrote - and the class fills in a lot of the gaps in knowledge that AP Bio and even Intro Bio at Yale leave you with. Take it if you are in MCDB for sure. Even if you're not, if you've taken Bio 101-104 and you like cells you should take it!",
    "This is a great course if you want to learn a lot of info about the cell. Lectures are sometimes dry. The quiz every week gets tiring, but you get the hang of the format and they become less daunting as the semester goes on. In general the format of the class is extremely well organized and very effective, and the professors have really geared the course towards students and tried to create the best learning environment they can.",
    "Good course. TONS of material, but the packets help a lot. Really, if you just understand the packets well, you'll do well in the course. You'll also learn a bunch about cell bio."
