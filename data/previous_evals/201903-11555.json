   "comments": [
    "I learned more advanced topics within general concepts in which I'd had prior exposure in high school. I learned how to solve more complex problems and how to use approximations to make problems workable.",
    "A more rigorous understand of AP Physics C mechanics. Also a solid introduction to special relativity.",
    "Although the material of this course will be familiar to anyone who has taken AP Physics C in high school, we cover it at a much deeper and more mathematically rigorous level. For instance, we discuss moment of inertia as a tensor and we derive the solution to the differential equation for a damped-driven harmonic oscillator. I developed my physical reasoning skills and an extremely good intuition for the material, which is an essential step to pursuing more advanced physics topics.",
    "I learned a lot of physics, and also probably how to think about physics, which maybe the more useful skill.",
    "Just as the name of the course suggests it's an intensive introduction to physics. You cover all the material you would normally cover in an intro mechanics course with more difficult concepts added on. The class teaches a very strong foundation for future physics classes.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to better develop my physical intuition and problem solving skills for classical mechanics problems.",
    "A very mathematically rigorous foundation for classical mechanics and an intro to special relativity.",
    "Knowledge: Physics concepts like Gyroscopes, Relativity, and Oscillations, which were not covered in my high school physics class. Skills: How to apply physics knowledge to scenarios that I have never seen before. Insights: I think it is better overall to take a course that you will be intellectually stimulated by rather than to take one just to guarantee an A. That is what I did here.",
    "We gained a thorough exposure to introductory physics, including mechanics and special relativity.",
    "Momentum flow, central force motion, gyroscopes, damped and driven harmonic oscillators, and special relativity are the new (beyond Physics C level) topics that this class teaches. Apart from that, familiar topics from high school mechanics but with more math, specifically calculus in three dimensions. Multivariate concepts needed for assessment taught directly in class, not presumed to be known by the students (mostly for the benefit of those taking Math 230). Making approximations (very important).",
    "Learned a lot of mathematical techniques for intermediate physics concepts, especially mechanical, as well as how to better approach applied math\/physics problems.",
    "Newtonian mechanics, oscillators and special relativity. This course provides a rigorous, calculus treatment of these topics from first principles.",
    "PHYS 260 taught us basic Newtonian mechanics (kinematics, forces, momentum, energy, rotation, etc.) as well as special relativity (mostly centered around Lorentz Transformations).",
    "I learned about special relativity (which I had never known in depth before), and I learned how to approach physics problem using sophisticated (at least for my limited math background) mathematical models.",
    "We learned primarily about newtonian mechanics, harmonic oscillators, and special relativity",
    "A more nuanced and advanced understanding of mechanics as well as special relativity toward the end of the semester.",
    "Learned how to think more critically and intuitively, along with useful problem-solving skills. New concepts (for me) included gyroscopes and relativity among others",
    "General problem solving and self studying habits.",
    "Before I took this course, I didn't have a strong appreciation for physics. It was confusing and I didn't understand it in high school. I still don't understand a lot of things, but this has really shown me how crucial physics is to understanding how our world works and has taught me to appreciate the long proofs and confusing mathematical equations because of their physical implications.",
    "A deeper mathematical approach to mechanics. Covers harmonic oscillators and special relativity towards the end.",
    "Knowledge of classical mechanics in a more advanced sense than a typical introductory\/high school curriculum and basic understanding of special relativity.",
    "You'll receive a broad overview of Newtonian mechanics solving simple (and not-so-simple) problems of motion and rotation as well as the scintillating harmonic oscillator, and just a handful of lectures on special relativity. This is in addition to the problem solving skills you'll cultivate while working through the problem sets.",
    "I got a very fast paced and comprehensive overview of many topics in mechanics and relativity, and learned a variety of new methods for solving physics problems. I also gained insight on why various laws and facts hold because we went over a lot of central derivations.",
    "Mathematical approach to mechanics and then some special relativity.",
    "Learned a wide range of concepts about classical and relativistic mechanics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is well-organized and the workload is very manageable. The class environment can sometimes be frustrating, and I wish Professor Girvin would choose not to answer questions that derail the lecture. The topics are very interesting and the lectures move at a good pace.",
    "The class was mostly engaging. The PSETs were challenging but fair, and the tests were relatively straightforward. At times the lectured seemed a little disorganized and difficult to follow.",
    "The course moves at a quick pace, but not so quick that we don't get an opportunity to learn the material. The problem sets are a mixture of problems from the textbook and problems that Professor Girvin comes up with himself, all of which are problems that force us to engage with the material on a deeper level than plugging-and-chugging or regurgitating formulas. The office hours are plentiful and are an invaluable resource for working through sources of confusion with peers.",
    "It was generally very good. Lectures were clear and there was a lot of support from TAs and the like. My largest complaint was that it seemed in the last week or 2 when we were covering relativity we sort of felt rushed, and I think maybe we didn't cover quite everything. While I appreciate a lot that professor Girvin took time to always answer questions during his lectures, I think it might have been possible to cover the last material more thoroughly with just 1 or 2 fewer digressions.",
    "The course teaches you a lot of physics. The TAs and professor are extremely helpful at office hours in helping you understand the concepts presented in class. The lectures can be difficult to follow at times and the psets can include material not covered in lecture. You definitely need to be ready to use the textbook and teach yourself how to do the problems you see on the psets and exams. That being said lecture mostly helps with understanding the concepts whereas the book teaches you to do the problems.",
    "Overall, the course was well taught. The professor did an excellent job of engaging the students. He played an active role in the learning process and made sure that no question was left unanswered. I have no complaints about the structure of the class whatsoever other than I wish the professor would be more detailed in his presentation of the mathematics on the board during his lectures.",
    "I think this is a pretty good course if you like physics. I thought I liked physics but I realized it wasn't really my thing during this class. Special relativity was really interesting and I wish we spent more time on it. A lot of what we did was applying much more mathematical rigor to the stuff learned in AP Physics C, which was a little boring but I think it might've been necessary for people who are going into physics. Also, I would've appreciated if the peer tutor hours were not the night before the problem sets were due because that made my Sunday evenings way too stressful.",
    "Strengths: The material is genuinely interesting, and challenged me probably more than any other class has done at Yale. Professor Girvin is genuinely passionate about the material, and he is a very interesting, accomplished, and overall fun person to learn from. Also, I met a bunch of interesting people that I never would have if I took 180. Weaknesses: Grading. The Final Exam should technically be worth twice as much as an individual midterm, as it had twice as many questions. Also, the TAs played a much more passive role in the class than I anticipated - they did not show up to lecture, and they did not proctor our exams. Professor Girvin did all of this. One thing that could\/should be changed in subsequent iterations of the class is that we did not do any practice problems during lecture, we only learned derivations of abstract physics concepts. However, this makes sense given the nature of the majority of STEM lecture classes at Yale.",
    "This course was strong in that the amount of workload was ideal and the course also provided good resources for studying.",
    "The class taught concepts well and thoroughly, but example problems in class and topic organization were somewhat hard to follow.",
    "I really liked the classroom demonstrations like the two dropped balls to show relative motion\/ center of mass frame (they collide above the floor and the top, smaller ball rebounds very high) and the resonance setup (multiple pendulums of different lengths which end up swinging at the same frequency). The homework problems could be more interesting though. And we rushed through the special relativity section in the last few lessons.",
    "Overall, the course is very fast paced and sometimes we were not able to cover all of the material in class. The class is good at pushing us to make sure that we knew the material very well and ensured that we were able to face various applications of the concepts that we learned in class. The homework tended to be harder than the midterms but about the same level as the final and the peer tutors were extremely helpful.",
    "Strengths: The problems and topics are very interesting, and the workload is manageable given the difficulty of the material. Weakness: The lectures were very dry and not engaging at all. The problem sets were consistently too difficult to the point where I could not understand what the questions were actually asking.",
    "Dr. Girvin is an absolutely fantastic instructor; I do not know what more could be done to improve the course.",
    "Strength: GIRVIN! We all loved him, and he is a really knowledgeable professor. Peer tutoring is also very helpful; even if you think you know the material, go anyway. Weakness: some of the later material we had to learn on our own, so maybe extra peer tutoring time before the final would've been helpful.",
    "pset problems were very interesting and engaging when they weren't taken from the textbook while the textbook problems were routine. Lots of help hours but lectures move at a very fast pace.",
    "The professor and course itself is good but I did not like the textbook very much, as it did not do a great\/thorough job of explaining concepts.",
    "Large class, and often times, the class was taught in a way that was unnecessarily complicated.",
    "Some suggestions would be some more hands-on experiments to help students understand the intuition behind some mathematical equations, more frequent peer tutoring sessions, a piazza for student collaboration and easy way to ask questions, and recorded lectures to look back on especially since the pace of the class can be quite fast.",
    "Very good curriculum, engaging instructor, maybe could be 3 lectures per week rather than 2.",
    "Our lectures were always engaging, and concepts were presented clearly. Professor Girvin encourages a comfortable atmosphere in which asking questions is the norm, not the rarity. My only wish, rather oddly, is that we had been given more homework. Introductory physics has a lot of concepts, and many are only covered by one or two pset problems before disappearing beneath pages of new notes and new concepts. Perhaps this could by combated by including a couple of review problems on each pset, to highlight the most important ideas from previous lectures.",
    "This course was very interesting and covered a lot of topics in depth, however, it was too fast paced at times. It could be improved by restructuring each class a little so that we don't take time away from topics covered later on in the course (like special relativity, which we only had one class on)",
    "Girvin is a good lecturer often, and I liked the fairly mathy approach to physics. Definately need strong math skills to do well. Use peer-tutors, they are great.",
    "Biggest strength is the peer tutoring resources. Weaknesses include the fast pace of lectures and the lack of time spent on many key concepts."

   "comments": [
    "For students who like math and physics, I would definitely recommend this course. The class is challenging but not out of reach, especially if you have a strong high school background.",
    "If you have a strong physics (and to a certain extent math, but that does not matter as much) background, this class will definitely deepen your understanding of the basics.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student hoping to take intro physics at Yale who has some background in vector calculus or is willing to self-study a little bit. PHYS 260 is honestly not that much more work than the other intro physics courses at Yale, but the level of understanding that you get is much greater.",
    "Yeah. Obviously somebody interested in physics and ok with a workload, but the material is mostly very cool and the professor is good.",
    "If you feel comfortable with mechanics and want an intense look over it then yes. Just make sure you're ready to do some learning on your own and are committed to making sure you understand everything well.",
    "I would in fact recommend this course to another student. This class is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics and does an excellent job of getting you to hone your physical intuition and utilize your critical thinking skills in order to become a more efficient problem solver in the physical sciences.",
    "If you really like physics and math, then yes you should take this course. I took it as one of my science requirements which in hindsight didn't make a lot of sense. There's probably other less intensive physics courses if it's just a side interest for you.",
    "YES. Take this class if you placed into it, or if you've taken MATH 120 or any multivariable class at Yale. It is significantly less work than 180 or 200, and the material is genuinely interesting if you have even an inkling of interest in physics. Many friends complained to me about the quantity of work and lack of fulfillment classes like 180 were, so I would highly encourage other students to take 260 if they have the opportunity.",
    "Yes, I believe it provided a good exposure to intensive introductory physics.",
    "I really liked this class, but it may be more practical not to take it for some. A. If you want to major in physics: If you know integral calculus well and are comfortable with doing a lot of algebra, I can recommend this class to you. It might be manageable even if you have not taken Physics C, but shop 200 if unsure about your physics background. If you HAVE taken calculus based physics and are very confident about your knowledge, possibly consider Classical Mechanics instead. B. If you are looking to fulfill a prerequisite for engineering or a pre-med requirement: Choose something easier and\/or more focused on your area. C. If you need to fulfill a distributional requirement: Choose something easier, unless you are really comfortable with physics but just more interested in doing something else - you might enjoy the overview of physics and learning about quantum computing in 231 if Prof. Girvin is teaching.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has a thorough understanding of mechanics\/relativity concepts at the college level. The concepts are very hard to follow if you don't have a foundation in these topics already.",
    "Yes. Be prepared to self-study the hardest two chapters in the textbook on relativistic collisions and dynamics right before the exams though, because it will be tested a lot in the finals!",
    "If you really want to push yourself to learn physics and are confident and comfortable with your abilities in math, this is a great course. You will learn quite a bit about physics and get to interact somewhat closely with an amazing professor.",
    "If someone is interested in physics or the physics major (and have a sufficiently strong mathematical background), I would urge them to consider the course. I would also encourage them to explore other options because this course can be a bit difficult to swallow sometimes.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any student looking to study physics or simply interested in physics. The class gave light to concepts I had previously seen.",
    "YES; the class is fantastic, and Girvin is an extremely talented scientist. If you are choosing between 200 and 260, I would say take 260 if you know you love physics and take 200 (or lower) if you are taking physics just as a prerequisite. (P.S. his tests are NOT curved)",
    "If you are an aspiring physics or physical science major this course is a very thorough introduction and will improve both physics skills and math skills. Problems require critical thinking and is overall a very enriching experience.",
    "If you like or think you might like physics then yes. Even though it is supposed to be the most intensive intro physics course, the workload is not overwhelming and there is enough support between the professors, undergrad peer tutors, and TAs.",
    "Yes, because although it was difficult, it was a lot of fun learning physics in a new light.",
    "Yes, Girvin is a great professor and you will learn a lot about physics topics that first-year students don't usually get exposure to.",
    "Yes if they have a genuine love of physics and are prepared mathematically so they can focus more on the physics concepts and less on the mathematics concepts.",
    "Yes, strong introduction to physics for prospective STEM students",
    "If you're looking for a mathematical introduction to physics, absolutely. Physics 260 will challenge you, better your understanding of the physical world, and impart a serious appetite for physics. It will also force you to be quite rigorous in your problem solving, and merciless in error checking.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in physics and who enjoy learning new methods and tricks for solving problems and derivations.",
    "Yes! If you love physics\/math, don't be afraid to take this course! it's well taught and not too big.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student coming into Yale with a strong background in math and physics who is interested perhaps in a physics major and is looking for a challenging course to take.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student: the instructor is good at pacing a class period and teaching the material. Topics that may have been covered in high school physics are covered in more depth in this class, which made it more rewarding to me than taking a less advanced intro physics course like 180 or 200."
