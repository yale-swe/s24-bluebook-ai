    "Etem yak\u00c4\u00b1\u00c5\u009f\u00c4\u00b1kl\u00c4\u00b1! It's always a joy to get to hang out with Etem, and he's made my Turkish experience so far. HOWEVER, I found 130 significantly less enjoyable than 110\/120. The random grad students who joined our class this year really should have been in an advanced class; having them in Intermediate made the class move too quickly, caused too many distractions, and, I think, really detracted from the TKSH 130 experience. However, it would have been great if he opened up another class for them so that everyone in Intermediate was on the same page.",
