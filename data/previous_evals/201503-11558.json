    "as BENG electives go, this is solidly the best. it's basically a material science class, so it's good for any engineer, honestly. Gonzalez is EXCELLENT. warning: assignments are due three times a semester, but there's like 10 due on each of the three dates blog posts every week two midterms and a final three journal article reviews three problem sets one in-class group presentation",
    "Take this class for a great BME elective, or if you're just interested in the intersection of materials science and the body. There's no need to know any high-level math, although some chemistry background might be helpful. The workload is pretty light. There are only three psets throughout the semester, along with three journal article reviews. The two midterms are overall fair, although be prepared for questions on concepts that were never covered or barely discussed in lecture. The final exam is more of the same, but be sure to study past homework problems! Prof. Gonzalez is a good lecturer who knows her stuff, but she can be a bit disorganized at times. Oftentimes she would gloss over concepts that turned out to be important and were tested. Going to lecture is recommended, as material that is not covered on the slides will be written on the board.",
    "Biomaterials is a great BME elective that I would definitely recommend, though there will sporadically be more work than you have expected. Professor Gonzalez is a great professor and a big reason why this class is what it is. Note that there is a lot of information in each lecture and the powerpoints may seem confusing, so do not hesitate to go into office hours with either Professor Gonzalez or the TAs.",
    "This is a good class that requires as much work as you want to put into it. It's a good change of pace from other biology\/chemistry classes and focuses on application to materials by exploring both positive and negative aspects of their properties. Honestly, really cool.",
    "This is the most fun BME class I have taken. Professor Gonzalez is great, and I felt like I ended the semester with a knowledge of biomaterials that I can apply to engineering projects.",
    "Definitely recommend this course to other students. If you have any curiosity for materials science and application in the medical field, this class is perfect. Loved the material, loved the instructor. There was a lot of work to do and it could be better organized, but I really liked the blog because it let me do a lot of independent research on things I found really interesting. Prof Gonzalez is the best.",
    "Perfect BME elective because the course has a light workload yet you actually come out of it with a great understanding of biomaterials. I love how Professor Gonzalez applies everything we learn in class to biomedical devices (which makes sense but surprisingly few BME professors actually do). She made sure to tie theory \/conceptual ideas to real world solutions and made you think about improvements to current tech.",
    "Professor Gonzalez is a wonderful instructor, who tries very hard to make the material relatable and interesting. Sometimes, though, it seemed that we had a lot of work due in small chunks of time. For example, we had exams, presentations, blog posts, journal reviews, and PSETS due within 2-3 class periods. Overall though, I learned a lot and it was a great overview of biomaterials.",
    "Biomaterials is a fantastic course, especially for students looking into going into industry post-grad. As Professor Gonzalez herself says, students really begin to think like scientists after taking this course. I personally liked how it synthesized aspects of intellectual property law, manufacturing, and entrepreneurship into a holistic view of biodevice design.",
    "BENG 343 is a pain. The questions on the exams don't make sense or are drawn from material that hasn't been taught, the homework is cumbersome and repetitive, and the lectures are disorganized. While the material could be really interesting - you really don't get much from this class. If you can, take Kyriakides class instead.",
    "I definitely came into this class thinking it would be chill, based on past reviews, but Gonzalez vamped it up this year. If there are still blogs and journal reviews in addition to presentations and psets, then prepare to allocate some time to this class. There were previously no blogs or journal reviews until this year and they are somewhat a pain, but since we could choose what topics to explore, they definitely gave me more exposure to current science research that I was interested in."
