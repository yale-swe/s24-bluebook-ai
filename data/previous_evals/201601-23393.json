   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned nothing from this class.",
    "I think the course is too theory based. The Prof is incredibly nice and smart but I think most students, including myself are looking for application and not theory. I found myself more confused about topics in the end.",
    "The course provided a nice overview of linear regression models (and other models) using SAS. It helped increase my knowledge of SAS, however I felt like it could have done a better job showing the students how to actually write their own coding. In the labs, we were provided with codes. I would have loved the experience learning how to do this on my own to enhance my skills as a future researcher.",
    "Strengths: He didnt force us to learn complex SAS code, but still enforces it. The class also really strengthens data interpretation skills, which has made me feel more prepared for telling stories with data in my career. Weaknesses: Lecture was exactly the same thing as the textbook, so it felt redundant. The exams were unpredictable. We had a lot of practice exams to look at, but there is always one question on the exam that is \"free response\" but there is so little guidance in the question that its hard to guess what he wants to hear. A picture of a graph is the prompt with the words \"Explain the graph. Be brief.\" I lost points for not explaining certain things, but Im not sure how I was supposed to know what he wanted. Also, when the professor went over the midterm in class he couldn't even tell us what the point break down was for each section, so we had no idea where we had lost points. The most disturbing aspect of the class was the way we got our midterms back. The grades were on the top of the front page right next to students names, and Dr. Zelterman chose two students to hand all the exams back while he stood on the stage in Winslow and watched. I got a really good grade on the exam, but I still really felt uncomfortable having other students see everyone's grades.",
    "Strengths: I like the textbook Dr. Zelterman wrote and it's consistent with what he teaches (since he wrote it for this course) Weaknesses: 8:30 am biostats...just stop.; inadequate feedback on graded homeworks and exams - most of the time just says \"good job;\" grading for the midterm exam was totally inconsistent and varied among students and TAs. Some TAs literally just left after 2 minutes of reading off of lab slides, and I felt a lot of the TAs were just not prepared for sections. The class is also just too abstract for us applied epidemiology students and is hard to grasp. Dr. Zelterman is unable to answer straightforward questions regarding \"when should we use x test?\" I will admit chapter 13 questions are useful in this regard, but this question was asked in class, and we never received a cohesive answer. Improvements: make class later! Please seriously consider this. Increased communication and preparedness across TAs and professor. PLEASE. Increased feedback for graded assignments. It would be nice if this course was more coordinated with the CDE Analytical Methods course most students are taking at the same time, and because the courses are very similar. More emphasis on being able to write SAS code ourselves instead of just giving us the code. I agree interpretation is important but so is writing the code. Overall assessment: most students agree here: biostats IS SO IMPORTANT. We need better courses that will prepare us to apply the biostats we learn. Please re-evaluate how biostats 505 is structured and offered. It's a shame I am not able to be confident in my biostats foundation after dedicating a year to it now.",
    "professor wrote the textbook so as long as you read up and attend lab you're good. not painful and actually pretty helpful",
    "This course was at 8:30am which is a major problem. This needs to be changed next year. Otherwise, I found that you could either go to class or read the textbook, but doing both was overkill. Thus, I never went to class and read the textbook before exams. This class gave me a very basic overview of more ways to analyze and look at data, but I wouldn't say I completely understand it now...",
    "Overall, the lectures were excellent in that they provided less of the minute detail that normal stats courses provide, and a much more big picture justification for why we do the statistical tests that we do, and when to use them. However, this advantage also means that at times it can feel like the course could be going a little faster, with a little more detail involved. But I enjoyed the class. It was a good way to tie in everything that I've learned statistically at YSPH. Labs were horribly designed and structured. Only took a few minutes for the TA to go through her presentation that was handed down to her by someone else. The remaining 50 minutes were completely wasted time. It's definitely a situation where you have to self-learn. Mayur's labs blew this guy's labs out of the water. In my opinion, time to do some updating of the lab structure. With better structure of labs, this course could be great.",
    "It's a very good course. Provide the theory behind all the statistic methods needed in real life research. After the course, I have a better understand of the way to choose statistic methods.",
    "I appreciate how interested in the subject matter the professor is; while I don't think his teaching style is for everyone, I loved how theoretical his method was",
    "Biostats 2 could be helpful in better understanding Biostats however I did not leave this course feeling like I have any deeper understanding of stats truly. I would have liked more depth, especially given that compared to other Biostats departments, Yale's has a reputation for being weaker and leading to less student preparedness than other schools of similar academic caliber. It could be improved by having Biostats, AAMIE, and Epi 2 all coordinate material to see where their overlap happens and teach the same concepts around similar times. This would be really helpful for students overall to better learn the material of the spring semester I believe. The class this semester seems like a joke, compared to what students said of last semester's amount of preparedness.",
    "i disliked that it was at 8:30am. It often felt a bit too rudimentary, yet there is a very high chance that I still did not learn any of the concepts presented in the course. Or there is a chance that I have learned the basics of biostatistics. I think the issue is that I really do not know if I have learned what I needed to for the class or if what I learned was all there was to learn in a second semester biostats course.",
    "Prof. Zelterman is really nice if you go to speak with him. His lecturing style is a little odd though. When you raise your hand, he'll look at you and say \"no.\" Then he has this awkward laugh that he does. Then he'll answer your question. Everything you learn is straight from the textbook he wrote. Doesn't seem like he prepares what he's going to talk about. But he wrote the text book so you know he has everything down cold. I don't regret taking the course because I knew I needed some more biostats training but I think you would be almost as well off just reading the textbook and completing a few practice exams.",
    "This class was my favorite of my time at Yale because of the instructor. Having some take home materials would have been helpful however - and a way to address all learning methods.",
    "None",
    "My main issue with this class is the disconnect between what the professor teaches in class, what the TAs go over in lab, and how the grader scores labs and tests - as in, there does not seem to be any communication between any of them. The course itself is fine; it's a required course for most and most people won't go because it's 8:30 in the morning. I personally feel as if he spends the first half of class re-hashing the previous lecture and the next half drawing out the material that could be condensed in 20 minutes. He is great at explaining things, to his credit - just that I feel he coddles the topic. The book (his book) does a great job in covering everything, which is what most people rely on for learning.",
    "I think the structure of this course is very good since it involves many problems we may face in real life. And it's also related to SAS program, which is very useful for us to deep understand statistical basics.",
    "Waaaay better setup than biostats I. It is very focused on actually learning and comprehending the subject rather than just memorizing formulas and struggling through SAS code. Lectures are pretty slow and a little boring if you have any prior knowledge of statistics, but labs were illustrative and simple and tests were fair.",
    "I thoght that Prof. Zelterman did a very good job providing a foundation for the material and then bringing in real life examples in lab demonstrating the practicality of bio-statistics. The course was less about memorization, but where you can use these skills to assess and analyze a possible problem or situation. I found the class interesting and highly useful.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the course. It's theoretical in nature with minimal emphasis on SAS. It can be difficult to grasp for students that need direct mathematical applicability. Lab assignments, at times, did feel vague.",
    "I feel like the professor had good intentions about what he wanted us to learn, but that he was too relaxed about it. I used the powerpoint slides from last year to help me go back and understand the concepts. I like the way he was open to student questions, but I felt",
    "Biostats 505a and 505b need to be completely revamped and redesigned. I don't feel like I got anything out of both classes. Both professors teaching styles are very poor.",
    "This course introduces you to how to analyze data using linear regression in SAS. However, more importantly the class teaches you how to think about data, how to present analyses, and enforces the idea that you must understand how you a real analyzing data.",
    "This course did not provide the biostats background that I was looking for. Strengths include the lab assignments that made the concepts applicable in the real world. Weaknesses include the way the instructor teaches the information. It is unclear. Having a different way to present the material, i.e. powerpoint presentations would be helpful and a book that is not written by the professor would be helpful so we can have another prospective on the material.",
    "Practicality of the homework assignments to projects that we will be working on for thesis etc.",
    "I felt that it was important material, but unfortunately was unable to be taught well. I often did not understand lectures (and eventually stopped going), and also labs were very difficult to follow along. Only when working on problem sets did I actually try to learn the material. The midterm and final were more difficult that the previous ten years of examples, which I did appreciate having.",
    "My learning style did not work well with the way the course was structured, however, at the end of the class I had learned to select the appropriate statistical method for a variety of situations. This skill will be invaluable in my future course work and career.",
    "Strengths- I really like the instructor's approach to statistics as more of an \"art\" than a \"science,\" and how the point of statistics is to try and see over the \"wall\" that exists between a sample and a population. Its super theoretical approach, as opposed to problem sets, made this class much more bearable and enjoyable than Biostats 1. Especially at the beginning, the instructor was able to fill in gaps in knowledge that I had from Biostats 1. Areas for improvement- Since so much of the material overlaps with AAMIE and Epi II, it might be useful to collaborate with those instructors to maximize learning potential, since so many students are taking all three of these classes at once. Also, having Powerpoint slides instead of handwritten notes would be much more useful for reviewing!!!",
    "There needs to be more communication between all professors of the main epidemiology curriculum because there was a bit too much overlap. But I did not feel well prepared for epidemiology II because this Biostatostics class did not go into enough depth.",
    "Weaknesses: 1) No experience actually coding in SAS 2)The course material seems extremely watered down 3) Exam questions are often so vague that we don't understand what is being asked of us",
    "I felt that the lectures and books covered the same information and I found them to be repetitive rather than supplementary. I wish that we had more of an application focused class.",
    "In retrospect, I like the course. I think the labs are useful exercises, although you get no informative feedback from the grading. I thought we spent about the right amount of time on topics. Not a big fan of some of the data interpretation graphs we start class off with, mostly just a chance for to inject some personality into statistics but some of the figures were just arbitrary and did not lead to fruitful discussion. The final exam seemed pretty straight forward but the midterm was rather read-my-mind and didn't seem to test course concepts up to that point.",
    "There are not many strengths of this course. Almost everything of value that was covered was also covered in Applied Analytic Methods of Epidemiology. Well over half of the examples had nothing to do with biostatistics and were instead related to economics or politics. The grading was vague, subjective, and arbitrary based on who your TA was, what they thought the question was asking, etc. Tests were useless. Homework assignments were basely useful. I have also have major concerns with the way coursework was returned. Homework was returned via a literal box in the hallway with names and grades clearly visible. Tests were handed back in class and in the box with names and grades clearly visible. This is in violation of FERPA privacy rights. Coursework can be returned in this manner ONLY if other students cannot see grades or there is no clear way to connect a particular student to a particular assignment. I never signed a waiver or asked if this method was alright - and it is not.",
    "Professor Zelteman wrote out each course's content, which is difficult to review during the reading week. A powerpoint would be way much better.",
    "Great course, covers material very useful in analyzing and understanding complex data. I appreciated that the course was more about interpreting and understanding the data than just managing the data (performing operations on the data to get a specific value).",
    "To do well in this course it became unnecessary to go to class or attend the weekly labs. By the end of the semester, I would just review the textbook on my own and turn in labs each week.",
    "Labs and lectures failed to have adequate relevance to each other."

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I enjoyed having Daniel Zelterman as a professor this semester. He was dynamic and kept student's interested in the topics discussed in the course. Overall, I would have liked if we could have gone more in-depth into some of the topics. In general, the course moved slowly. It may have been better to have more of a beginner level course and then a more advance course.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I like that you use examples outside of the public health realm, but sometimes there were no examples from the public health field. Improving that may help this class seem less abstract and more applied. Please put more emphasis on writing SAS code AS WELL AS interpreting it. I wish you were more in touch with how assignments were graded by your TAs and how lab sections were taught.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0No need to attend class, but sometimes its helpful to hear him walk through things",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0use more health examples (not donuts or economics)",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Funny dude, very smart, clearly explains stats in a way that is understandable to all. Not focused on meaningless details, but more about big picture concepts. I thought it was a breath of fresh air to have a class like this that wasn't just memorizing formulas and going through mechanics. It's a nice complement to Klaus' style of teaching which is also great, but completely different.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman is a kind and good professor. He explain concepts clearly. I enjoyed his teaching a lot.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very engaging lecturer, however, may be difficult to make connection between lectures and exams.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0see above",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Zelterman is a truly nice man who is agreeable and kind. I think he truly wants us to succeed in the course (heard that everyone gets HP or H in this class), but not sure he does a great job with his teaching style for most students in the course. I did appreciate that he provided us with real world examples of public health applications - he is the ONLY professor I have had here at YSPH who has addressed the Flint water crisis for example, and I truly appreciate his real world examples that he gives in class to us. He does a great job of connecting our programs to the real world and is great with larger thinking processes. He also does a great job of giving us SAS codes and asking us to focus on interpretation - however, none of these processes are quite validated for each of us as individual students. However, I would have liked more depth. Often Zelterman would put his published book on the projector and read examples from his book to us in lecture - I wish that my time in lecture could have been captured better by other examples than the ones already in the published book - often I felt going to lecture was not as useful as I would have hoped. I didn't even bother reading the book when not in class. When asked specific questions, Zelterman often deflects or refuses to answer them directly, this is what I have found in my experience. That can be a bit frustrating, and so I stopped asking. He has also made a few comments about Asians as \"orientals\" in lecture which is not really PC and I have found a bit offensive. I think his teaching style is relatable to some people in class, however not to many many others. I don't feel like I left this course learning all that I could, although I will feel probably okay but the grade I get. I didn't try to put too much effort into this class semester because I felt like it was not worth the focus of my efforts.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Daniel zelterman is the instructor I'd basically been waiting for my entire academic career. He is interested in understanding material- not just getting through it. He always brings it back to WHY not just HOW, which so many faculty and students focus on. He is an abstract thinker and teacher and I really connected with his thought process. I will be taking any courses he teaches in the future !",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0It's already good enough.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman knows his stats and can relate it in a way that makes the material fairly easy to learn. He knows the theory and math behind everything and can explain it, but manages to get the central concepts across for a non-stats student. He's great with feedback and answering students' questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is really a great professor. He is helpful and very patient to our questions. I really like his style of teaching. But I think the exams are a little bit confusing, and sometimes the questions are not very clearly and it is hardly to understand what it is asking for.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He is a brilliant man, and an excellent statistician. He unfortunately was unable to convey his knowledge effectively to his students. In addition, the 8:30 AM start time was ridiculous, and may have led to more negative outcomes.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is a wonderfully kind person and tried to the best of his ability to create a good class environment and learning situation for the students. I think that there could have been more structure to his teaching, perhaps slides or handouts to go with his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strengths- Able to frame statistics in a very approachable, non-scary light. I like how he starts every class with a \"real world\" example in showing how statistics can be presented and mis-represented in media. I would appreciate if he had powerpoint slides to help lay out the scope and sequence of his lectures, instead of just handwriting things that make sense at the time but are kind of confusing when looking back at them.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Interacts with students in an interesting and usually humorous way. I usually felt engaged and always attended class because of his teaching style which seems to make biostats rather understandable. Generally explains things in a relatively straightforward way which is within grasp of the students but at times simply repeats a statement which wasn't understood in the first place.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0While Dr. Zelterman is a wonderful person and I think is genuinely interested in his students, I feel that he has been teaching this class too long. The material hasn't changed or been updated in years, despite it not being relevant to the course subject.",

Section is the same things as hearing the book for the 3rd time (counting lecture as the 2nd) since it just takes examples from the book and puts them on slides. The only good thing about it is that you get to analyze data sets in a way that is more like what public health practice than the contrived situation with doing traditional textbook questions.",

    "I would not recommend it, I would recommend using online resources from other schools like UCLA who have very indepth materials on biostats that are at a much higher caliber than that of our department's (unfortunately true). It is often required, so some students must take it but would never take it as an elective.",
    "If you are required to take it, then do. What you learn in AAMiE and Epi should give you enough foundation to get by in biostatistics.",

    "I thought that is made me appreciate biostats more that I had before. Biostats505A is a very unfortunate class and after that I never wanted to take another biostats course, but Prof. Zelterman and how he taught the class made me appreciate the skills I was gaining.",
    "I did not take biostats I so I cannot make a comparison to that. That said, I found biostats II to be enjoyable, at a good pace, and theoretical. I would recommend it to another student because, by the end of the semester, I had a good grasp of what test should be used depending on the problem at hand.",
    "Take it if you want a great foundation for statistical analysis of public health data.",
    "The course is not very helpful for learning the biostats material. I would not recommend it to another student because I believe they will get better information out of Epidemiology II.",
    "You are taking this course because you have to. Best of luck. Use the midterms\/finals\/book to study.",
    "I loved DZ's teaching and exam style, which is well summarized by this passage from the text: \"How is this book different? The mathematical content and notation are kept to an absolute minimum. To paraphrase the noted physicist Steven Hawking, who has written extensively for the popular audience, every equation loses half of your audience. There is really no need for formulas and their derivations in a book of this type if we rely on the computer to calculate quantities of interest.\"",
    "If you need to take it, you need to take it. But this class needs some serious improvement to be at all useful to an MPH.",
    "Definitely useful for a more theoretical approach to statistics, and learning how to interpret statistics from SAS output- don't take this if you're looking a math-heavy class. And show up for lecture, don't be those people who come only to the midterm and final and then complain that they don't understand anything. Like, duh, of course you don't.",
    "In it's current state, people who have taken biostatistics or statistics in the past should waive the course.",
    "The course was not very challenging, I felt as though it lacked a real world connection or application outside of the themes in the book. It would have been nice to be more connected with our specific fields of study at YSPH. I would not recommend it but I know that it is required and we have no choice.",
    "A neat synergy exists between biostatistics, SAS, and AAMIE. A key class in understanding SAS and what statistical tests to use.",
    "I would not recommend this course, but unfortunately most MPH students will have to take it. Exempt if possible and take AAMiE where you will learn actual code, actual analysis, and actual interpretation.",
    "Very different from first semester of biostats. Here you'll basically just talk about a million different ways you can run regressions in SAS. This is good because it's quite useful. However, it can also also be tedious with lab writeups every week. Exams are hit or miss. Not that hard, but for some reason I always ended up doing poorly on them.",
    "According to feedback from other students, Prof. Ciarlegli is better with a structural outline and course design.",
    "Great class to help understand the different models for interpreting data. Highly recommend.",
    "This class was a required course and was moderately helpful. I would not recommend it to another student but it is required to take.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course; given that it is a required core course, I recommend the curriculum for Epi2 and BIS2 be combined."
