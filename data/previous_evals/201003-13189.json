   "comments": [
    "I would. The reading is somewhat dry and dense, but the information you can synthesize between the readings makes them worth it and the discussions, like in any DS class, are great.",
    "Slanski's class is hard but worth the effort in all respects. Your writing will vastly improve, your understanding of texts will become more perceptive, and your understanding of history will develop in all respects. Prepare to be challenged and expect great rewards for meeting the challenge.",
    "It's a course blending political and historical thought, covering Greek, Roman, and Medieval periods. If you're lucky enough to have studied most of these writers before, you will enjoy it from the first day. If you haven't had that opportunity, it will at some point make sense, and you will have gained an appreciation for the dealings of the subjects presented.",
    "Take it, no question, as with all DS.",
    "Take this class. The workload is a lot, and the readings are sometimes confusing and difficult, but the class is never boring. You'll improve your writing exponentially, especially if you get Prof. Slanski. The lectures are extremely interesting too. Be aware that there are three papers. There aren't any midterms, but the final exam will seem pretty difficult unless you've been meticulous in your study habits. If you're up to a lot of reading, writing, and if you're genuinely want to discover how politics and history intersect, take this course. You'll walk out of it feeling smarter.",
    "H\/P is tough, but it's worth studying. These are truly foundational works, and DS makes us study them in a way that emphasizes not brute memorization but critical and thematic thinking. I got a lot out of this class, and I would recommend it to anyone willing to put in the effort.",
    "DS HP is a great course choice for students who are interested in history but have never studied records of antiquity. The course covers some interesting works and others that are tedious but ensures a variety of historical accounts. This allows all students to find something that they find accessible and to consider multiple approaches to understanding history. HP involves much more reading than the other two DS courses, and thus covers much more information, which can be challenging when it comes to studying for the final exam. However, this can make HP the most fulfilling course -- if you are assigned an apt section leader (which you probably will, as most of the HP professors are skilled and knowledgeable), you will delve thoroughly into the works you read and emerge feeling that your knowledge of history has been substantially augmented.",
    "I love Directed Studies! Be aware that you really won't get to spend much time on a single work, which can be frustrating, and the workload is intense, but it's such a fulfilling experience. My philosophy teacher described it the best: it's like the tour at an art museum. You take the tour to look at everything with a well-rounded expert, but then you can go back to look at those one or two paintings that most drew your eye. The same is true for DS: you get to read so many of the great works of ancient and Medieval thought. Not all of them will be appealing, but trust me, you will fall in love with at least a few (for me it was Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War), and those sparks of inspiration will guide your future studies. (Note: this is the same answer I gave for Question 1)",
    "Take it because DS is worth it; switch teachers if you can.",
    "Brilliant books written by brilliant authors and explained to you by brilliant professors. As a first-semester college student, what more could you possibly want, academically? It eats up a lot of your time, but I still managed to stay involved in activities and go out basically every Friday\/Saturday. No paper weeks = Wednesday night Toad's."
