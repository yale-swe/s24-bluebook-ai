    "ITAL 781 provides an in-depth reading of Boccaccio's Decameron. Prof. Marcus draws upon her own writing and scholarship about the text to provide guiding points and questions at each seminar meeting, and the bulk of the analysis done during discussion and in student papers is intended to draw upon a close-reading of Boccaccio's prose. The end of the semester includes a screening of Pasolini's film adaptation of the text, a spirited piece that does much to capture the bawdy essence of Boccaccio's original."
