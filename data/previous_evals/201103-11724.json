   "comments": [
    "This is a great film studies course that introduces you to recent Russian and Chinese film, which is especially insightful if you haven't watched films from either countries before. Some of the films are extremely moving, others are gruesome, and some are absolute masterpieces.",
    "Great course that was surprisingly accessible as someone with no real background in film studies. I learned a lot in each individual class from the films, the readings, and discussion. It would have been nice to get a bit more into the historical context and how the films connect with each other with respect to that, so the course was a bit disconnected from week to week. MacKay is incredibly knowledgeable, but almost more important, very enthusiastic, helpful, and kind.",
    "superb class. great and unexpected films, interesting and challenging conversations, genuinely kind professor who is enthusiastic about material and about teaching and has wide breadth of knowledge and interest, and is doing interesting work",
    "Yes, yes, do. The course has a syllabus of films that you will find nowhere else. Whether you are from a China or Soviet or Other background, the course will knit together what you know and what has never occurred to you with stunning insight from Prof MacKay, who is a gem of a teacher (knows everything about philosophy, history, literature, art, and brings it effortlessly into conversation). There are midterm and final papers, about which Prof MacKay is open and helpful, and there is a wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm from him that lights up the class.",
    "This is a difficult seminar. However, it's a valuable lesson in both history and critical analysis of film. It's definitely worth it."
