   "comments": [
    "I learned how to engage with art and film more critically.",
    "This class covers films throughout the black diaspora made in the US, the Caribbean, the UK and Africa. The course goes beyond a survey to actually get at the heart of diasporic film theory and the question of whether or not there is such a thing as \"black film.\"",
    "This course completely shifted the ways I understand cinema overall and the potentiality of cinema coming out of the African diaspora. The syllabus was rich with the critical texts and films I have never been exposed to, which had not this course been an option, self-discovering these films and readings would have been highly unlikely. Over the semester, the information administered in this course developed me in areas that my other professors have taken positive notice of. Having spent two years at Yale University, so far this is the most beneficial class I have ever taken.",
    "The knowledge and insights I developed in this course are so vast and varied that I can hardly articulate them here. Discussions and readings on the style and content of black cinema as opposed to Western cinema, blackness, and the themes, visual techniques, and purpose of black cinema are all fraught topics of conversation that benefit more from being views as discourse than hard and fast facts.",
    "I learned a lot about African American film theory, and learned a lot about the topics and tools discussed in the black film cannon.",
    "I learned about some very influential Black film scholars and filmmakers. I learned to develop my analytical skills and engage with films in a intellectual way.",
    "I learned about an area of film studies that I knew almost nothing about before, as well as how to parse through difficult reading material.",
    "The course definitely strengthened my understanding of film theory, exposed me to incredible and thought-provoking work that has been missing from my education, and generally allowed me to apply so many of the things I have learned in and engaging classroom setting.",
    "I learned about more of the aesthetics characteristic of Cinema of the Black Diaspora and gained tools for approaching films as a text.",
    "I acquired critical thinking skills that pushed beyond the limits of euro-centric thinking. I think I also developed an greater understanding for underappreciated aspects of filmmaking auch as music.",
    "This was quite a hard class. I developed a greater insight on the meaning of diaspora, blackness, and the qualifications of a black film."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I appreciated breaking down readings in seminar because often they drew on theories and philosophies that I was not familiar with. I wish we had had a writing assignment earlier in the semester instead of just the final paper in order to gauge the kind of writing needed in the course.",
    "The film selection and readings were really strong. I'm typically overwhelmed by a lot of reading but the articles were really fruitful. The weaknesses of the course are the allotted time spent inside the class with the professor going over the material-- it's not enough and really great discussions usually got cut off because of it. A longer course or second section over two semesters would improve this."
