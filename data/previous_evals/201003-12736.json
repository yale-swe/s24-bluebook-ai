   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic course for anyone with an interest in creative writing in any respect. Having to write in the format and with the rules of screenwriting opens your eyes to new things as a writer and can be very helpful even if you don't pursue screenwriting. Definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend Screenwriting to another student who is looking to learn the basics of screenwriting as you learn both the technical side, and you end the class with a 12 page screenplay. However, you do get as much as you put into it and no more, so I would encourage you to meet with your sub groups and write beginning early in the semester.",
    "Take this course if you want to write screenplays.",
    "This is a great introduction to screenwriting, although what you really learn is that the real work takes place outside of the classroom. You have to stay on top of the midterm folder and really start working on it ahead of time. In addition, you have to take it upon yourself to read coverage in your own time and develop your sense for story. Really, you would only take this class because you loved Marc Lapadula's teaching style. He has a lot of good things to say, but in the end, whether or not you turn out to be a screenwriter is up to you.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone looking for a not-too-difficult intro course. Know, however, that only so much progress is actually made, and that to get more out of the professor, you will most likely need to take one of his follow-up courses.",
    "This class will really stretch your creative muscles. It's a fun group of people, and you'll get as much out of it as you put in it.",
    "This is a very good introduction to screenwriting; if you're interested in film and stories and writing, take it! The structure is basically: first half of the course, talk about structuring the screenplay, developing a story, and other basics; and second half, reading and critiquing rough drafts of our screenplays and suggesting how they could be improved. There wasn't time for everything, and I do wish we'd covered more of the fundamentals (developing characters, pacing, describing visual action, story arc) in more depth at the beginning, but the writing workshops were definitely valuable. If you can, take this early on so you have time to take the entire screenwriting sequence - I took this too late to be able to write a feature senior year...but I found it a valuable course (and a relatively easy\/stress-free one) nonetheless.",
    "If you're a realistic film studies major unlike myself you'll understand this class will probably land you a job after Yale. Professor Lapadula is a very kind person, also very quirky and fun. Warning: what you learn about narrative in theory classes is generally incompatible with what you learn in this class. As in, there's a formula.",
    "Good introduction to screenwriting, though I wish we could have had more direction and feedback on our writing, especially the final screenplay we turned in at the end of the class. The group component of course needs to be improved."
