    "I'm not ordinarily much of a literature person, but I ended up really enjoying most of the works we read in this class. The short stories, many of the poems, the plays, and the essays are all very interesting, and are much better to study in Spanish than they would be in translation.As for the class, it was pretty nice. You just do a couple readings for each class and discuss them for 75 minutes with a few other students and the ever-courteous, professional, and insightful Profesora Harkema. I'm really glad I took it, and I'd recommend it to other students. My Spanish conversational skills have gotten significantly better, but there's also the literature element to the class, which I think makes it better than a purely conversational course. All in all, it's very pleasant.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 060 01 to another student if a) you really want to learn more about Spanish literature, and b) if you can keep up with a huge amount of reading in Spanish. If so, it's a fun class. I personally learned a lot from it, and even though it has probably no relevance to my future plans, I feel like a more interesting person for having taken it.",
    "This course was a solid intro to Spanish literature; you'll recognize a lot of names after taking it. The readings are enjoyable, some of them essential. Don't take it if you took AP, or if you are a native speaker familiar with the literature.",
    "ONLY TAKE THIS CLASS IF IT IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY. It is a draining class, and it's easily to get pulled under. After that, there's really no way to get back up.",
    "If you have never had a significant study of Spanish literature and literary movements across the Spanish speaking world-- or if you had, but you'd like a more profound introduction to the field than your high school's AP-- this is the perfect class for you! It covered a wide variety of movements and mediums that helped understand the identity of these authors and the culture of the societies they lived in. This course was the sampler plate-- small morsels of a huge number of scrumptious delicacies each with its distinct blend of tastes--which often is the best and most irresistible item on the menu!"
