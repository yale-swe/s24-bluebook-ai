    "Themes and principles that have shaped international environmental law in modern history",
    "Being new to law and international law this was an awesome course. Now have a basic understanding of what law and international law is about, how it develops, and how to approach law questions is great. Really was killing many birds with one stone - and successfully so!",
    "I learned about the main international environmental law cases and their precedents. I gained insight into the main themes and principles that govern international environmental law. I learned to take a position and support it with multiple forms of evidence.",
    "I had never taken a law course before so the biggest thing I took away from this was how to approach issues from a more \"lawyer\" point of view. This is very useful moving forward as a lot of environmental issues have legal aspects to them, so understanding how to think like a lawyer as well as learning about cases and policies that are influential in the space will be of great assistance.",
    "amazing swath of knowledge about international env law including history and current fracture lines",
    "International Environmental Law has been one of the most insightful classes that I have joined. It wasn't just about the treaties, conventions and cases, it was also about the thoughts and evolution of thoughts that have resulted in decisions shaping international law. I enjoyed the balance between the soft and hard law. The case studies and present day disputes brought into discussions were also valuable.",
    "Through this course, I improved my knowledge on environmental law, legal terminology, and learned how to build a case and arguments to support it. I also improved my negotiations and reading skills.",
    "In class, we frequently considered the question \"what is law?\" This consideration usefully guided our discussion of international environmental law, which I learned is less a strict system of enforced rules and more a fluid, subjective jumble of mutual agreements, coerced commitments, and vague idealistic goals. These features characterize all forms of law, and studying international law threw the structure of legal systems into sharp relief. I became better at thinking about wha law means and how it operates. I also gained a sense of the many conflicting interests that factor into environmental problems.",
    "Working knowledge of major international treaties covering environmental issues, understanding of international legal principles and customary law, examples of the application\/generation of such principles and treaties",
    "General understanding of international environmental law - Basics of law - Important international environmental cases - How to argument for an outcome"

    "Very well indeed! This class exceeded my expectations, especially for a law class!",
    "The class exceeded my expectations. The lectures, materials, and class discussions were engaging and very interesting. I enrolled in the course because I wanted to improve my knowledge on international environmental policy and law instruments. On top of this, I gained useful tool such as building argumentation around a case. I really like that during the course examples of cases and environmental issues around the world were discussed.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: knowledge and enthusiasm of professor, group discussion activities Weaknesses: Increase amount of group discussions and activities",
    "Great structure to the course. Some of the readings were a pain (such is the nature of those readings!). Prof. Verchick was extremely engaging and good at navigating dynamics in room, and using the diverse group of people in the room (grads, undergrads, foreigners, Americans, law-student, and absolutely-not-law-students). One minor complaint was that (as a visiting professor) he didn't really get how Canvas is normally used - so the syllabus and material was confusingly announced... But I'll most certainly forgive that.",
    "The strength of the course is listening to the professor and my peers analyze a case and learn how they would support a particular position. The course could be improved by providing more detailed Powerpoint slides (with more text) so that the slides are easier to follow when studying.",
    "This course was great. The professor is very engaging and clearly cares about students understanding the material and learning how to think through the issues rather than memorizing facts. Overall it was a great learning experience.",
    "more case debates in class",
    "The simulations and group thinking exercises were great! The lectures were fantastic! I wouldn't change anything.",
    "The course has a lot of strengths: the structure, the book and the selected readings, the negotiation simulation, and the class practical exercises. However, it covers many areas of law, I suggest covering less topics to spend a little bit more time on each of them. I also suggest reduced the importance\/weight of the final exam and give credit to class exercises or other assignments.",
    "The class was a good mixture of the technical and the philosophical. Our discussion of legal documents and cases did not prevent us from using ethical and scientific concepts to critique them. Professor Verchick is a great lecturer and a great guy, so class was always enjoyable. I enjoyed taking a break from the restricted format of the casebook with readings from outside sources, and would have appreciated more such readings.",
    "Covered a wide variety of environmental topics in relative depth. Would be nice to have a few readings outside the ILE textbook (which is also considerably more expensive than other textbooks, which is a consideration). Little feedback during the course on understanding or participation",
    "The class was very good and the professor has an amazing way of lecturing and engaging students Perhaps having a bit more of time (maybe outside of class) for non law students to understand basis of law and practice expressing ideas."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in understanding how legal and moral principles have shaped the international regime of environmental law, I recommend taking this course. It also does not demand a lot of work, which is a nice balance if you are taking more time consuming\/challenging courses at the same time.",
    "If want a primer to law and international law, and is a bit interested in environmental issues this is a great - like GREAT - course. If you are a law student who knows very little about environmental concerns and law this is probably a good course. If you are a law student who's well familiar with environmental concerns and somewhat acquainted with environmental law you might enjoy the course but not gain too much from it.",
    "I would advise buying the book since you will be reading from it all semester.",
    "As a non-law student prepare yourself upfront for all the law jargon especially before delving into cases.",
    "I would recommend a student to do the readings! and identify the most important instruments and cases in each of the sections of the syllabus because they will be very useful for the final exam and for engaging in class discussions.",
    "Take it! A wonderful foray into international law, policy, and diplomacy, through the lens of pressing environmental issues. Professor Verchick is great.",
    "Make sure that you're self-motivated in your approach to learning, because there aren't many milestones to gauge your progress before the final",
    "The professor was great, but he was a visiting fellow. The class is good to understand general environmental international law"
