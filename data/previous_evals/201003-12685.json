    "As with all seminars, it depends on the other people. Take it if you're interested in the topic and have an idea for a research paper you want to write, because the paper is the focus of the course.The course is interesting. Because it is thematic, it all ties together, but not always in an obvious way. It was hard at the end of the semester to say anything cohesive other than a better general idea of many different points of view, but that's okay.Professor Marcus has taught the class before and knows his material well. He is very receptive in office hours, and helpful in trying to get you to start your paper early. His style of leading a seminar could be frustrating when he seemed to be looking for answers rather than a discussion.",
    "A great course, readings were engaging, class dynamic was good. Take it"
