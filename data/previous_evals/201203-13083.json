   "comments": [
    "Good introduction to the world of video art. Not a film class in any way, though Johannes' lectures are quite engaging.",
    "Good if you're interested in making video art. You work mostly in After Effects and Premiere. Theres a couple smaller midterm projects and one very open ended final project, which you spend the second half of the semester working on in class.",
    "If you only want to learn how to use Premiere and After Effects, absolutely. But if this is your only goal, it comes with the price of being exposed to a lot of weird and seemingly irrelevant art and artists that will leave you questioning the purpose and legitimacy of contemporary fine arts.If you want to learn about the state of digital technology in the arts, absolutely. If you have little experience with the Adobe Suite or Macs, however, it may be difficult to get a grasp of the detailed UIs of Premiere and AE. You'll become fairly proficient with it if you stick to it, but be aware that it can be tough.",
    "I heartily recommend this course to fellow students. It's so useful to have a background in taking and editing film with the primary intent of creating an aesthetic experience.Once again, the instructor is an especially large factor in any art class. And the instructor for Digital Video is an utter delight. Take this class.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class. If you want an introduction to how to produce a quality digital video--look elsewhere. If you want a history of avant-garde film--look elsewhere. If you want to sit around in the DMCA for four plus hours every week, learning how to work software (sort of work it) you'll never use again, then maybe you should consider this class.",
    "yes. you get introduced to a lot of useful programs, tools, works, and ways of thinking. but it's up to you to figure out what to do with it and how much time you spend learning more about everything presented to you.",
    "Introduction to Digital Art shot me in the foot this semester. Let me explain. Art145 is an introduction to digital art which means that it briefly introduces you to the software of video editing and looks at a bunch of artists work in the field. If you just want to know about video editing I would advise you to go on lynda.com (which yale provides free access to) and learn there because honestly it will teach you more than what you will ever learn in this class about video editing. That said, if you want to learn how to use it as an \"art\" form than take the class. I would advise you to start projects early and seek out Johannes (the professor) as you work on it because for a majority of the projects you don't spend any time on them during class. As for me I was stupid enough to spend an absurd amount of time on projects (I mean days worth) only to be frustrated when things did not turn out okay and then get good advice during critiques which would have saved me all that extra time (by then it was too late).",
    "If you just want to learn to edit, I do not believe this is the class because this art class is formatted to be a in-depth investigation of film as an art medium. If you are interested in really pursuing video as a medium, go for it."
