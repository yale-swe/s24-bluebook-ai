   "comments": [
    "German 120 with Professor Niesz is an excellent second semester introductory German course. It is conducted in a seminar format with an extremely friendly and personable instructor. The class is composed of the four strands of language learning: aural, oral, writing, and reading. The class emphasizes the development of oral and aural skills, however. The class itself is centered on the grammar covered in the second half of an introductory German textbook with particular stress placed on covering the important, fundamentals of German grammar in addition to many of the sociolinguistic nuances of the language. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, who prior to enrolling has the equivalent of a level one background in German. Professor Niesz is extremely approachable and always comes to class prepared and with a positive attitude. He adeptly integrates multimedia into the classroom to enhance the learning experience and tries his best to ensure all students leave the class knowing sufficient German grammar and with well developed (especially for level two) speaking, reading, writing, and reading skills. He is a man of great intellect and makes everyone feel comfortable in class. This class teaches German grammar in a non-boring way with a very dynamic, interesting instructor who brings great insight into his lessons.",
    "Definitely take this class! Niesz is such a fun teacher, and you really will learn a lot without having to do nearly as much work as you do in most language classes.",
    "Herr Niesz is a great guy, lots of fun, but expects you to do a lot of the work on your own to fill in the gaps. The book is very bad so you have to go to him with any questions, and he can stay around after class for a few minutes to answer them, or see him at office hours. Not too crazy, but you HAVE to know your stuff! It's a small class on the off-semester so take advantage of that. But be prepared, he doesn't explain everything very well, so you'll have to figure some of it out yourself.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. It is a great way to solidify one's basic knowledge of German."
