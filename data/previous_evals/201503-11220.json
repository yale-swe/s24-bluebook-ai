    "A typical class is reading some poems by an author for a given week, and then workshopping two or three poems by students. I liked the specificity of topics for the poems, since I had been wanting to explore them through poetry.",
    "Poets' Landscapes takes you through an amazing syllabus in an intimate class setting. Most of us were new to poetry and, though we didn't get much feedback on our poems, workshopping them in front of classmates was transformative. Besides, the poems were read were really wonderful."
