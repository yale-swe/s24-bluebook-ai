Southeast Asia in Context is a five-week thematically based exploration of Southeast Asia's geographical and cultural diversity, which takes advantage of Singapore's position and character as a microcosm of this diversity. Blending classroom instruction on NUS Kent Ridge campus with hands-on fieldwork in Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand, SEA in Context offers modules on Southeast Asia with anthropological, historical and archaeological concentrations. The core module, SE2222: Southeast Asia in Context provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia from a historical, sociological, and anthropological perspective. Its partner module, SE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic, will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture, and features a 10-day field trip to various religious, cultural, and archaeological sites in Cambodia and Thailand. Both modules deploy context-based learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited. For further information please visit the Yale Summer Session Study Abroad website. 1 Yale Credit and 1 NUS Credit. Tuition: TBA. Course dates: June 21 - July 25.",

        "description": "This course explores modernity in relation to the changing character of London as a metropolitan and imperial center from the late 19th century to the present day. &quot;Modernity&quot; is a highly contested term. In this course it is used to denote both the attempts to modernize the city itself, as well as its inhabitants' experiences of the ambiguities of life in the biggest city the world has ever known. How London coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size is one of the early questions explored in the course. Other key themes are: the local and the global, sexual scandal, popular entertainment, consumer culture, the experience of war, and the development of a multi-racial society. The fashion, food and popular music of London emerge as important components of the city's global identity in the 20th century. Students will come to see today's London as a complex product of development and destruction, viewing it more as historians than mere tourists.",

Topics include measurements of disease frequency and association, study design (including randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and ecologic studies), screening principles, reliability and validity, bias, confounding, and effect modification. After completing this course, students are able to calculate and interpret epidemiologic parameters, identify the strengths and weaknesses of various study designs, and apply the principles and methods of epidemiology to the design and analysis of new studies.\nNot open to students in the traditional two-year M.P.H. program.",

Focus on the source of each play's pathos and the nature of its poetic sublimity; some attention to performance and to the relation between the genres of history and tragedy. Extensive practice in writing short and medium-length critical essays. Students should come to the first class having read Julius Caesar. (The Signet edition, ordered through The Yale Bookstore, is preferred, but the Norton genre volumes are especially handsome substitutions; the Arden single play editions are more than acceptable if their price is not intimidating.) The regular course meetings will be supplemented by six evening screenings, and students are asked to attend at least four of these. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,600. Session A: June 1 - July 3.",

Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change. 1 Credit.

        "description": "The basic building block of a movie is a well-crafted scene. It instructs the screenwriter/filmmaker in a visceral and tangible way as to what does and does not work in production.This class focuses on the anatomy of a motion picture scene using the tools, craft, technical, and creative methods required to translate the written word to a visual language. Students learn filmmaking -- script analysis for production preparation: producing, budgeting scheduling, camera aesthetics and techniques, directing, working with actors, lighting, sound design, editing and media management. The course is a comprehensive collaborative journey using material previously produced and critically recognized in order to allow students to explore the contribution of the producer, director, cinematographer, sound designer, and editor. The emphasis is as much on process as product. Each student works collaboratively on multiple scenes over the course of the semester in each of the above mentioned crew positions. The pace of the course assumes some prior technical familiarity with digital HD cameras, field sound recording, competency with HD workflow and final cut non-linear editing: however, the course begins with detailed seminars in each of the crew positions before productions begin. The goal of the class is to go through a practical professional procedure of creating scenes from the perspective of key crew positions as if it were a complete motion picture, thus enabling the students to understand, absorb and solve their own work. Limited to 16 students. 2 Credits. Tuition: $7,000. Session B: July 6 - August 7.",

What constitutes the experience in the arts? And what separates our desires in the real world from the pleasures art promises us? Is there really a fundamental difference between low or even sexual desires and those higher forms that art can provide us with?\u00a0 And is it true that dreaming is as close to suppression and wish fulfilment, as film is said to be? What does this tell us about our dreams - and about art? Apart from theoretical texts (including Freud, Jung, Fechner) class will treat painting (from Raffaello to Dali), Photography (from Man Ray to Jeanloup Sieff) and Literature (From Rousseau to Doeblin), as well as opera and film. 1 Credit.

Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change. 1 Credit.

        "description": "Examines the problem of evil in three major literary texts from the Renaissance to our own time: Milton's Paradise Lost, Shelley's Frankenstein, Rushdie's Satanic Verses. How the idea of an omniscient, benevolent God can coexist with the presence of suffering in the world; whether evil exists or whether it is an aspect of human behavior and choice; and what can we do to train ourselves to combat evil and suffering. 1 Credit.
