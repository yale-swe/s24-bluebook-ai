        "description": "5-week program: based in Prague, Czech Republic. An intensive, hands-on exploration of the history, theory, tools and techniques of narrative filmmaking offered jointly by Yale and FAMU, the national film and television academy of the Czech Republic. The program interweaves a Yale seminar, in which students learn the fundamental principles and techniques of cinematic storytelling via readings, screenings, discussions and creative exercises, and a FAMU practicum in which students expand and apply the knowledge acquired in the seminar in hands-on workshops and the production, in small groups, of four short film projects: a silent film shot and edited on 16mm film, a classical scene shot on FAMU's state-of-the-art soundstage, a chase film shot on the streets of Prague, and a location-inspired final film. Students choose either FILM or ART credit. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Prague and all other program expenses beyond tuition. For further details, such as program costs, exact dates, credits, etc., visit the http://studyabroad.yale.edu/programs/cinematic-storytelling-prague program page on the Yale Study Abroad website.\u00a0",

And the landed aristocracy in their country estates established seats of power which they made manifest in the design, scale, and expense of their gardens and the architecture of their houses.",

Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role. The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material will include the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life. Students from all majors are encouraged to take this course. Prerequisite: differential and integral calculus. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,200. Session A: May 27 - June 28.",

If human beings are just biological machines, then how is it possible that we have a subjective point of view on the world? Why are we not just mindless robots, that produce behavior in light of stimulations from the environment, but lack any inner awareness or consciousness? In this class we will read, and bring together in conversation, cutting edge work from philosophy, psychology, and the neurosciences on the nature of consciousness.

Starting with the heyday of Edo when the city lent its name not only to the shogun\u2019s capital, already a thriving urban center of over a million inhabitants, but to the historical period itself (1604-1868), we will examine the city\u2019s reincarnation as the imperial metropolis of Tokyo in the Meiji period (1868-1912), the phoenix-like cycles of destruction and reconstruction through the Great Kanto Earthquake (1923), the firebombing of the city during WWII and other significant changes in the topography and lived experiences of the city. Particular emphasis will be given to contextualizing the classroom content with field trips to museums, historic neighborhoods and a hands-on experience of living in Tokyo. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Tokyo and all other program expenses beyond tuition.

        "description": "5-week program: based in Paris, France. Students will study, with particular emphasis on economic efficiency, the design of these contracts and the body of law that governs them. The curriculum develops through a substantive theoretical component and a practical component, with on-site modules at the International Court of Commercial Arbitration in Paris. This course takes the existing institutions of trade and contract law seriously - students will, for instance, develop familiarity with everyday trading practices and basic legal rules of exchange - and then asks whether and how they facilitate efficient trade. A principal topic of the course will be contractual solutions to the hold-up problem. Starting from seminal articles in the bilateral trade literature and the literature on breach remedies, the course will introduce students to the most recent developments of the field. Prerequisite: ECON 121 (Intermediate Microeconomics), MATH 112 (Calculus of Functions of One Variable I), or permission of instructor. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Paris and all other program expenses beyond tuition.

There are only two plots in all of literature, claimed the late John Gardner: the story of a journey, and of a stranger coming to town. Most travel literature is both: the story of a journey as well as a tale of a stranger, stepping into an alien land. This course examines a wide range of place-based literature, from long-form city portraits to travel memoir excerpts. Readings by writers such as Ryszard Kapuscinski, Jan Morris, Leslie Jamison, and Pico Iyer will acquaint students with the techniques by which journalists and writers capture the essential qualities of a place. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from France and all other program expenses beyond tuition.

A course unit is not given for the summer internship. All students, with the exception of those in the Advanced Professional M.P.H. Program and the Accelerated M.B.A./M.P.H.

        "description": "5-week program: based in Prague, Czech Republic. An intensive, hands-on exploration of the history, theory, tools and techniques of narrative filmmaking offered jointly by Yale and FAMU, the national film and television academy of the Czech Republic. The program interweaves a Yale seminar, in which students learn the fundamental principles and techniques of cinematic storytelling via readings, screenings, discussions and creative exercises, and a FAMU practicum in which students expand and apply the knowledge acquired in the seminar in hands-on workshops and the production, in small groups, of four short film projects: a silent film shot and edited on 16mm film, a classical scene shot on FAMU's state-of-the-art soundstage, a chase film shot on the streets of Prague, and a location-inspired final film. Students choose either FILM or ART credit. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Prague and all other program expenses beyond tuition. For further details, such as program costs, exact dates, credits, etc., visit the http://studyabroad.yale.edu/programs/cinematic-storytelling-prague program page on the Yale Study Abroad website.\u00a0",

Examining works of art from the Renaissance to the present, students will explore the way that the city has been conceived, utilized, represented, and modernized by artists for creative, cultural, and political purposes. Students will study the ways that Rome and its antiquities were regenerative and revitalizing forces on later works. Works from the Renaissance and seventeenth century will be considered, but the focus will be primarily on the eighteenth to twentieth centuries. To encourage student\u2019s first-hand engagement with works of art, the second half of each class will be devoted to the study of objects in Yale\u2019s collections. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,200.

        "description": "Must be taken in New Haven. May be arranged for currently enrolled Yale students only. Must be taken pass/fail. May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, who should also supply a 1- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor should submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it. These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based, and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,200. Session A: May 27 - June 28 / Session B: July 1 - August 2",

        "description": "Must be taken in New Haven. May be arranged for currently enrolled Yale students only. Must be taken pass/fail. May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, who should also supply a 1- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor should submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it. These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based, and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,200. Session A: May 27 - June 28 / Session B: July 1 - August 2",

This course provides a critical overview of the historical and contemporary health and health disparities research, relevant literature, and policies as essential context for understanding how to achieve health equity. The social and biological determinants of health and health disparities are also critically examined in light of political, economic, cultural, legal, and ethical issues. Selected health and health disparities population-based data are examined as a foundation for explicating how subpopulations experience disparate health across the lifespan. Students examine how past and current policies (state, federal, tribal), politics, population-based data findings, and selected frameworks enhance or act as barriers to achieving health equity with diverse populations, systems, and/or communities. Additionally, students design an organizational policy plan for achieving population health and health equity within a health system, organization, and/or community-based health system. Required of all D.N.P. students in the second year.",

        "description": "The increasingly integrated and globalized world has seen rapid economic growth and development but also greater volatility and geo-political uncertainty. Tackling global problems requires skills and strategies; this course provides students with the social science principles with which to understand national and global markets, the domestic and international uses of political power, and how these forces together shape the prospects and place in the world of nations and regions, with a particular emphasis on Asia. Through a series of dinners, students are introduced to practitioners from the worlds of policy, media and development whose work illustrates the application of concepts under discussion.\u00a0 Students will be required to attend tool-building workshops on Fridays. Tool-building workshops allow students to delve more deeply into the skills needed to bring social science approaches and methods to real-world problems. Course is open to college students and beyond. 2 Credits. Tuition: $8,200.00. Session A: May 27 - June 28.",

Internship sites include churches, social service and social change agencies, as well as other institutions. This course has an online component, offering students the option of fulfilling their internship in locations other than New Haven or its surrounding communities. The internship combines significant work engagement with supervisor mentorship, while students learn alongside a group of their peers and participate in weekly online meetings with a trained practicum leader. The Summer Intensive Internship with Practicum carries six course credits. To receive credit for the course, students must work 370 hours at their internship and complete 30 hours of practicum, which includes a two-day orientation that takes place on campus in May. Placements are determined in the spring term.",

        "description": "\u00a0As an introduction to sociological perspectives on social movements, this course is about how people act collectively to challenge the status quo of powerful political, economic, and cultural systems that resist change. Social movements that challenge such systems vary widely in terms of their group identities, social locations, strategies for action, particular demands, and tactics. In this course, we will consider a range of historical and contemporary case studies like the U.S. civil rights movement, the labor movement, \u201cnew\u201d social movements in the 1960s (like the feminist and gay rights movements), the Tea Party and its challengers, and the Movement for Black Lives. We will approach these movements through concepts like: Solidarity, Organization, Mobilization, Identity, Resources, Framing, Collective Memory, Narrative, Networks and Organizations, Forms of Protest, and Performance. Though our case studies are mainly American, we will pay close attention to the ways that collective behavior and protest in the U.S. matters globally. And we will also consider how the internet and social media have changed social movements by investigating the roots and future prospects of movements represented by hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,200. Session B: July 1 - August 2.",

Chekov In Performance is a studio based exploration of the world of Anton Chekhov, focusing on acting technique through scene work as well as character analysis and development. The class will consist of close reading, rehearsal, research presentations, and occasional performance. This course is meant to promote truthful talking and listening, living moment to moment, a willingness to take risks regardless of outcome, playing from impulses in oneself and the text, personalizing circumstances and a better understanding of how to develop character. The course will use scenes from IVANOV, THE SEAGULL, UNCLE VANYA, THE THREE SISTERS and THE CHERRY ORCHARD to launch into an exploration of The Five Questions which stem from Stanislavsky\u2019s work with Chekhov. While progressing through a sequence of short scenes and then longer scenes, the stress will be on understanding an acting technique that hinges upon an experiential exchange of energy between actors in pursuit of objectives. 1 Credit.
