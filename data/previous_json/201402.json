The course is actually a concise training program in which each student takes more than one class. The classes are in the following areas: (1) play analysis class, to understand what is to be acted; (2) acting class, to learn the application of basic acting techniques; (3) vocal production class, to improve vocal and articulation skills; (4) improvisation and mask class, to help free the imagination and to build confidence in spontaneous self-expression; (5) movement class, to strengthen the body and to encourage the use of the body for emotional expression; and (6) scene study class, to understand how the classes listed above come together when working on a scene. The instructors constitute a teaching staff of working professionals and are assisted by teaching associates giving the students individual attention. The summer drama program requires a full commitment of the student's time. Classes are held in the mornings, afternoons, and two evenings each week, Monday through Friday, with 26 to 28 classroom hours each week, 4 to 6 library hours each week, plus additional hours for individual tutorials and scheduled rehearsal time. Extra evening and Saturday morning sessions may be scheduled for group activities and additional classes. A single grade will be awarded for the course. Enrollment is limited.

        "description": "Offered in Tokyo, Japan. This course surveys the cultural history of Tokyo through literature, film, art, anime, and architecture and living spaces. Starting with the heyday of Edo when the city lent its name not only to the shogun's capital, already a thriving urban center of over a million inhabitants, but to the historical period itself (1604-1868), we will examine the city's reincarnation as the imperial metropolis of Tokyo in the Meiji period (1868-1912), the phoenix-like cycles of destruction and reconstruction through the Great Kanto Earthquake (1923), the firebombing of the city during WWII, and other significant changes in the topography and lived experiences of the city. Particular emphasis will be given to contextualizing the classroom content with field trips to museums, historic neighborhoods, and a hands-on experience of living in Tokyo. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Japan, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited. For more information please visit the Yale Summer Session Study Abroad website. 2 Credits. Tuition $6,700. Course dates: May 31 - July 5.",

Emphasis on analytical reading, critical writing, and class discussions. Authors include Melville, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Dickinson, Barnes, Toomer, H. Crane, W.C. Williams, L. Hughes, and M.

The social, cultural, and technological aspects of book publishing, production, and distribution from the fifteenth century to the present. Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change. 1 Credit.

Examines travel writing, surveying a wide range of works, from long-form place essays to destination articles, from travel memoir to adventure odysseys. Readings will acquaint students with the tropes of the genre and the techniques by which writers capture the essential qualities of a place. In examining the works of writers like Paul Theroux, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Jan Morris, and Pico Iyer, we will be paying close attention to how voyages lend travel writers structure: a natural beginning, middle, and end. Students are encouraged to take advantage of their geographic mobility for their assignments and tasked to find an innovative mode or vehicle of exploring their chosen place. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Auvillar, room and board costs in France, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Interview required. Enrollment limited. For further information please visit the Yale Summer Session Study Abroad website. 2 Credits. Tuition $6,700. Course dates: July 18 - August 15.",

        "description": "Offered in Siena, Italy. This five-week course combines beginning Italian with a course in English on Italian cinema focusing on Tuscany. Students will learn Italian through classes and full-immersion in the study-abroad experience (including a homestay), and will explore the representation of Tuscany through the screening and close analysis of films where the Tuscan setting has been elevated to the level of a primary thematic concern. Among the films to be considered are Room with a View, Night of the Shooting Stars, The First Beautiful Thing, Tea with Mussolini, The Sky Is Falling, Life Is Beautiful, Sandra, Mar nero, Good Morning Babylon, Fiorile, and the Florentine episode of Paisa. Students who wish to continue with Italian are required to take a placement test in order to place into ITAL 120. Students may petition for one HU credit. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Siena, room and board costs in Italy, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: March 1. Enrollment limited. For further information visit the Yale Summer Session website. 2 Credits. Tuition $6,400. Course dates: June 22 - July 27.",

        "description": "In this hands-on workshop, students make fully-realized scenes and critique narrative motion pictures. This class is filmmaking by practical application--script breakdown for production preparation: producing, budgeting, scheduling, camera aesthetics and techniques, directing, working with actors, lighting, sound design, editing, and media management. Collaborative independent industry-standard procedure is applied in production to well-written scenes from critically acclaimed motion pictures. Film professionals instruct and guide students in the application of industry standards. The course is fully integrated with FILM S203 to provide filmmaking students with a pool of acting talent and enable students to move beyond the technological requirements of the medium and establish common creative communication. Students work with the latest gear, such as vari-cams, stabilization, LED lights, jibs, and post- production technology, such as pre-visualization software and Final Cut X at Yale's Digital Media Center for the Arts. Nightly screenings of narrative movies further understanding of the medium's history and the students' creative vocabulary. Beginning with seminars, readings, and workshop exercises, students progress to a fully-realized scene. This workshop requires a full daily commitment of the student's time, including five hours of classroom instruction, two hours of screenings, one to two hours of reading homework and workshop projects outside of class time and on weekends. Although no prior filmmaking is required, a visual artistic sample in any medium must be included with application. Enrollment limited to 16. For students in college or beyond only. 2 Credits. Tuition $6,700. Session A: June 2 - July 4.",

        "description": "Cancelled. Students are on camera from day one in this intensive, full-time course that is integrated with the Independent Film Production Workshop (Film S-202). The On-Camera Workshop allows the student actor to solve the artistic and technical challenges of film acting. Students learn on-camera audition techniques and the tenets of good acting under the pressures and demands of film production. With rehearsed on-camera scene work, they acquire the technical language of cinema and practice acquired film acting techniques. Students act in one or more of the scenes produced by the Independent Film Production Workshop. Actors also audition for, and get feedback from, a Los Angeles casting director. Meeting with the casting director includes a Q & A about the business. Students are introduced to skills that deepen their understanding of the filmmaking process and help them produce their own work: directing, operating a camera and editing. With the Independent Film Production Workshop, the students view classic narrative masterpieces nightly in order to gain a sense of the medium's historical and aesthetic context as well as to develop a common vocabulary with fellow collaborators. Screenings, readings, and rehearsals supplement practical application. Daily commitments include, but are not limited to, 3-5 hours daily of classroom instruction, 2.5 hours of nightly screenings, 1-3 hours daily reading, rehearsal and shooting sessions outside of classroom time and on weekends. A one to two minute on-camera audition must be included with application. Enrollment limited to 16. For students in college or beyond only. 2 Credits. Tuition $6,700. Session A: June 2 - July 4.",

The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day.

Students will learn Italian through classes and full-immersion in the study-abroad experience (including a homestay), and will explore the representation of Tuscany through the screening and close analysis of films where the Tuscan setting has been elevated to the level of a primary thematic concern. Among the films to be considered are Room with a View, Night of the Shooting Stars, The First Beautiful Thing, Tea with Mussolini, The Sky Is Falling, Life Is Beautiful, Sandra, Mar nero, Good Morning Babylon, Fiorile, and the Florentine episode of Pais\u00e0. Students who wish to continue with Italian are required to take a placement test in order to place into ITAL 120. Students may petition for one HU credit. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Siena, room and board costs in Italy, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited.

Focuses on questions of the impact of political change on art and visual culture; the role of ethnicity, gender, and class in modern Middle Eastern art; and the lasting mark of colonialism, post-colonialism, and neo-colonialism on the region. 1 Credit.

This clinical course builds upon the experiences gained in 556b and provides students further opportunity to develop advanced nursing skills, clinical judgment, and evidence-based patient management strategies necessary to manage common acute and chronic health care conditions. Students participate in designated weekly primary care clinical experiences arranged by faculty. In addition, students meet weekly for a one-and-one-half-hour clinical conference that is held concurrently with clinical practice. Clinical seminar discussions for family nurse practitioner students focus on family-centered care and providing care for patients across the life span. Clinical seminar discussions for all other students focus on providing patient-centered care for patients from adolescence to senescence. Clinical conference serves as a forum for students to present and discuss cases and explore issues encountered in clinical practice. Required of adult/gerontological, family, and women's health nurse practitioner students in the final year. Eight to sixteen hours of clinical practice per week (fifteen weeks), and one and one-half hours of clinical conference per week (each term).\nTaken concurrently with 757a/b and, for family nurse practitioners, with 833a/b.

This course explores the cultural history of the imperial Russian capital, founded by Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century as a window on Europe. Since then, the city has been seen to embody all the contradictions of Russia: East vs. West, imperial grandeur vs. the pathos of the little man, nature vs. civilization, free will vs. fate. The course considers the semiotics of Petersburg through a careful reading of selected literary texts, both prose and poetry, including Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Blok, Bely, Gumilev, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky, Kharms, and others, as well as some works of literary and cultural criticism. The classroom sessions are complimented with a rich selection of excursions and tours in and around St. Petersburg. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from St. Petersburg, costs of room and board, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited.
