        "description": "Offered in China. This course is part of the International Alliance of Research Universities' Global Summer Program. The course is open to Yale students and other IARU members only. Memory powerfully shapes our understanding of our lives. In this course, we will examine how photographic images equally powerfully shape our memory. We will read some of the key concepts of several thinkers who have taken individual and collective memory as their subject, such as Jacques Derrida, Benedict Anderson, Maurice Halbwachs and Marianne Hirsch. Additionally, we will study some of the great writers on photography, such as Susan Sontag, John Berger, Walter Benjamin, Allan Sekula and Roland Barthes. At the same time we will also explore what we can learn about memory from photographs, digital photographs, and photographic memorials, from the 1830s to the present. These photographs can be anonymous or famous, historical or recent. Our interest will not be simply in what makes them great images, but also in what makes them greatly influential in our lives. We will have class discussions as well as lectures, and students will be expected to bring photographs to share with the class. There will also be two field trips to photographic galleries in Beijing. For further information visit the Study Abroad program page. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,750. Course dates: July 4 - July 29.",

The challenges of the 21st century in protecting the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage of the world are global in character and need to be also addressed on a global level. Cultural and natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions. For example, in the last years we have seen the phenomena of cultural cleansing rising in the Middle East and Africa, while natural disasters have taken a toll and underlined the need to develop sustainable and global strategies for preservation. This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex factors that challenge the preservation of cultural heritage. Guest speakers with relevant expertise will be invited to participate in many of the class sessions. In addition, the course will draw on the collections of the Yale University Museums for discussion and as the basis of student assignments. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,750. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

From early trading empires to present-day cosmopolitan hubs, we will examine commodity and financial flows, urbanization and globalization, consumer desires and popular cultures, with as much appreciation for difference as similarity across the Asian region and beyond.

Southeast Asia in Context is a five-week thematically based exploration of Southeast Asia's geographical and cultural diversity, which takes advantage of Singapore's position and character as a microcosm of this diversity. Blending classroom instruction on NUS Kent Ridge campus with hands-on fieldwork in Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand, SEA in Context offers modules on Southeast Asia with anthropological, historical and archaeological concentrations. The core module, &quot;SE2222: Southeast Asia In Context&quot; provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia from a historical, sociological and anthropological perspective. Its partner module, &quot;SE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic&quot;, will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture, and features a 10-day field trip to various religious, cultural and archaeological sites in Cambodia and Thailand. Both modules deploy 'context-based' learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited.

A range of tools are presented including scanning, digital cameras, retouching, color correction, basic composition, and inkjet printing. Students produce original work throughout the technical component of the class. After mastering the basics, students work toward the completion of a final project, and the focus of the remaining classes is on critiques. Throughout the term, lectures and presentations raise critical issues concerning the impact of digital applications and by-products on the medium of photography. Students must have access to a digital camera and bring it to class. Enrollment limited to 16 students. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,950. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

        "description": "Study of three histories and seven tragedies at the pinnacle of Shakespeare's career. Focus on the source of each play's pathos and the nature of its poetic sublimity; some attention to performance and to the relation between the genres of history and tragedy. Extensive practice in writing short and medium-length critical essays. Students should come to the first class having read Julius Caesar. (The Signet edition, ordered through The Yale Bookstore, is preferred, but the Norton genre volumes are especially handsome substitutions; the Arden single play editions are more than acceptable if their price is not intimidating.) The regular course meetings will be supplemented by six evening screenings, and students are required to attend at least four of these. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,750. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

The social, cultural, and technological aspects of book publishing, production, and distribution from the fifteenth century to the present. Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change. 1 Credit.

These programs are especially useful for juniors in providing them with actual research experience prior to application to graduate or professional schools. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty sponsor, who should also supply a l- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. Students taking Independent Research for 1 credit must work 35 hours a week for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students must work 35 hours a week for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,750.

Students will be introduced to major, relevant criminological and sociological concepts, theories, and debates. Class discussions will address contemporary social problems such as racial profiling, disproportionate punishment, mass incarceration, and unequal justice.
