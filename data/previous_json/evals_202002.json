Mathematical modeling is not a scripted procedure. Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.\u00a0 The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding.\u00a0This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life.

Directors of interest include Jia Zhangke, Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee, Wong Kar-Wai, Ann Hui, Tsui Hark, Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai Ming-Liang, and Wang Bing.

Sessions will be structured around ten films, each an entry point into a broader topic, such as the Fifth and Sixth Generation directors; the Hong Kong New Wave; New Taiwan Cinema; martial arts film; commercial blockbuster; and independent documentary. Directors of interest include Jia Zhangke, Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee, Wong Kar-Wai, Ann Hui, Tsui Hark, Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai Ming-Liang, and Wang Bing. We will examine their films formally, through shot-by-shot analysis, as well as in relation to major social, political, and economic developments in recent Chinese history. We will also consider pertinent questions of propaganda and censorship; aesthetics and politics; history and memory; transnational networks and audiences; and what constitutes &quot;Chineseness&quot; in a globalized world. 1 Credit.

The course will provide a survey for students so that at the end they will understand the major themes and developments in the history of the Middle East starting from the end of the 18th century to the last decades of the 20th century. The course will specifically track the development of the modern state in the Middle East through the reforms of the late Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, to the creation of the mandate system after WWI, and to the rise of the Arab nationalist states and Gulf monarchies during the cold war. Throughout the course students will encounter the entangled histories of state-making in the Middle East and the various areas in which these histories intersect with discussions about Islam, orientalism, colonialism, imperialism, oil, and gender. All this aims to provide students with a comprehensive basis for understanding the modern Middle East. This course will combine various mediums for online learning including synchronous teaching and live lectures, small group discussions, walk-throughs of digital archives, and documentary films related to the making of the modern Middle East. 1 Credit.

The 19th and 20th centuries in Europe were a revolutionary age. Analyzing why revolutions occur, how to start them, how to end them, and sometimes how to prevent them became a chief pursuit of thinkers like Edmund Burke, Karl Marx, and Hannah Arendt. But their theories of revolution didn\u2019t always coincide with revolutionary practice. This gap between theory and practice is our general theme as we survey the intellectual and cultural history of the French Revolution, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, the Paris Commune of 1871, the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, the failed revolutions of 1968, and finally the series of \u201cvelvet revolutions\u201d that brought about the collapse of the Soviet bloc starting in 1989. Other themes include the construction of revolutionary catechisms, the formation of revolutionary subjects (e.g., the working class, oppressed minorities, dissidents), the writing of manifestos, tactics (e.g., conspiracy, propaganda, violence), and the relationship between vanguard parties and mass movements. Together we\u2019ll read a graphic biography of the Polish revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg, look at radical avant-garde artwork, and listen to the militant songs that inspired past generations of European revolutionaries.\u00a01 Credit.

The course will provide a survey for students so that at the end they will understand the major themes and developments in the history of the Middle East starting from the end of the 18th century to the last decades of the 20th century. The course will specifically track the development of the modern state in the Middle East through the reforms of the late Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, to the creation of the mandate system after WWI, and to the rise of the Arab nationalist states and Gulf monarchies during the cold war. Throughout the course students will encounter the entangled histories of state-making in the Middle East and the various areas in which these histories intersect with discussions about Islam, orientalism, colonialism, imperialism, oil, and gender. All this aims to provide students with a comprehensive basis for understanding the modern Middle East. This course will combine various mediums for online learning including synchronous teaching and live lectures, small group discussions, walk-throughs of digital archives, and documentary films related to the making of the modern Middle East. 1 Credit.

As an introduction to sociological perspectives on social movements, this course is about how people act collectively to challenge the status quo of powerful political, economic, and cultural systems that resist change. Social movements that challenge such systems vary widely in terms of their group identities, social locations, strategies for action, particular demands, and tactics. In this course, we will consider a range of historical and contemporary case studies like the U.S. civil rights movement, the labor movement, \u201cnew\u201d social movements in the 1960s (like the feminist and gay rights movements), the Tea Party and its challengers, and the Movement for Black Lives. We will approach these movements through concepts like: Solidarity, Organization, Mobilization, Identity, Resources, Framing, Collective Memory, Narrative, Networks and Organizations, Forms of Protest, and Performance. Though our case studies are mainly American, we will pay close attention to the ways that collective behavior and protest in the U.S. matters globally. And we will also consider how the internet and social media have changed social movements by investigating the roots and future prospects of movements represented by hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo. 1 Credit.
