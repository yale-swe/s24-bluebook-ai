      "AFAM 060 Slavery in the Archives. Edward Rugemer. This first-year seminar explores the significance of racial slavery in the history of the Americas during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We read the work of historians and we explore archival approaches to the study of history. Taught in the Beinecke Library with the assistance of curators and librarians, each week is organized around an archival collection that sheds light on the history of slavery. The course also includes visits to the Department of Manuscripts and Archives in the Sterling Library, the British Art Center, and the Yale University Art Gallery.  Each student writes a research paper grounded in archival research in one of the Yale Libraries.

      "AFAM 205 Writing American Studies: Food as Story & Critical Lens. Alison Kibbe. This writing seminar examines food as an entry to the interdisciplinary approaches of American Studies. We explore how food can help us think critically about our world, as well as how we can write critically about food. Food serves as a useful entry point to interdisciplinary American and Ethnic Studies because centering food requires that we think across history, cultural studies, anthropology, science, ecology, aesthetics, embodiment, and more. Through food studies we gain a unique understanding of the peoples, cultures, plants, animals, mobilities, and flavors that shape societies, communities, and individuals. With a focus on Caribbean, Black, Latinx, and indigenous perspectives, we use critical food studies to examine questions about place, history, racial formations, migration, and above all, different approaches to writing, drafting, editing, and re-writing.\n",

      "AFAM 217 Queer Caribbean Performance. Amanda Reid. With its lush and fantastic landscape, fabulous carnivalesque aesthetics, and rich African Diaspora Religious traditions, the Caribbean has long been a setting where New World black artists have staged competing visions of racial and sexual utopia and dystopia. However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the \"tropics\" has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class begins with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique’s roots in black feminisms. We cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.\n",

Application of theory and interventions to policy creation and reform.\n",
      "AFAM 243 Black Arts Criticism: Intellectual Life of Black Culture from W.E.B. DuBois to the 21st Century. Daphne Brooks. This course traces the birth and evolution of Black arts writing and criticism−its style and content, its major themes and groundbreaking practices−from the late nineteenth century through the 2020s. From the innovations of W.E.B. DuBois, Pauline Hopkins, and postbellum Black arts journalists to the breakthroughs of Harlem Renaissance heavyweights (Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and others), from the jazz experimentalism of Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray to the revolutionary criticism of Amiri Baraka, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Phyl Garland and others, this class explores the intellectual work of pioneering writers who produced radical knowledge about Black culture. Its second half turns to the late twentieth and twenty-first century criticism of legendary arts journalists, scholars and critics: Toni Morrison, Thulani Davis, Margo Jefferson, Hilton Als, Greg Tate, Farah J. Griffin, Joan Morgan, Danyel Smith, Wesley Morris, Hanif Abdurraqib, and others. Emphasis will be placed on music, literary, film, and theater/performance arts writing.\n",

      "AFAM 261 Place, Race, and Memory in Schools. Errol Saunders. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement and widespread, multiracial protests calling for racial justice across the United States, there is a renewed interest in the roles that schools play in perpetuating racial disparities in American society and the opportunities that education writ large might provide for remedying them. As places, schools both shape and are profoundly shaped by the built environment and the everyday experiences of the people that interact with them. Teachers, administrators, students, and parents are impacted by the racialized memories to explain the past, justify the present, and to move them to action for the future. These individual and collective memories of who and where they are, and the traumas, successes, failures, and accomplishments that they have with regard to school and education are essential to understanding how schools and school reforms work. Grounded in four different geographies, this course examines how the interrelationships of place, race, and memory are implicated in reforms of preK-12 schools in the United States. The course uses an interdisciplinary approach to study these phenomena, borrowing from commensurate frameworks in sociology, anthropology, political science, and memory studies with the goal of examining multiple angles and perspectives on a given issue.\n",
      "AFAM 313 Embodying Story. Renee Robinson. The intersection of storytelling and movement as seen through historical case studies, cross-disciplinary inquiry, and studio practice. Drawing on eclectic source materials from different artistic disciplines, ranging from the repertory of Alvin Ailey to journalism, architectural studies, cartoon animation, and creative processes, students develop the critical, creative, and technical skills through which to tell their own stories in movement. No prior dance experience necessary. Limited Enrollment. See Canvas for application.\n",
      "AFAM 315 Black Feminist Theory. Gail Lewis. This course is designed to introduce you to some of the major themes in black feminist theory. The course does so by presenting classic texts with more recent ones to give you a sense of the vibrancy of black feminist theory for addressing past and present concerns. Rather than interpret black feminist theory as a critical formation that simply puts race, gender, sexuality, and class into conversation with one another, the course apprehends that formation as one that produced epistemic shifts in how we understand politics, empire, history, the law, and literature. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the areas into which black feminism intervened. It is merely a sample of some of the most vibrant ideological and discursive contexts in which black feminism caused certain epistemic transformations.\n",
      "AFAM 329 Managing Blackness in a \"White Space\". Elijah Anderson. White space\" is a perceptual category that assumes a particular space to be predominantly white, one where black people are typically unexpected, marginalized when present, and made to feel unwelcome—a space that blacks perceive to be informally \"off-limits\" to people like them and where on occasion they encounter racialized disrespect and other forms of resistance. This course explores the challenge black people face when managing their lives in this white space.\n",
      "AFAM 352 Caribbean Diasporic Literature. Fadila Habchi. An examination of contemporary literature written by Caribbean writers who have migrated to, or who journey between, different countries around the Atlantic rim. Focus on literature written in English in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, both fiction and nonfiction. Writers include Caryl Phillips, Nalo Hopkinson, and Jamaica Kincaid.\n",
      "AFAM 368 Zombies, Witches, Goddesses: Disorderly Women in Francophone Fiction. Kaiama Glover. This course explores configurations of the feminine as a force of disorder in prose fiction works of the 20th-century French- and Creole-speaking Americas. How do certain kinds of women characters reflect the troubling realities of the communities in which they are embedded? What alternative modes of being might these women’s non– or even anticommunal practices of freedom suggest? How are matters of the erotic, the spiritual, and the maternal implicated in Caribbean women’s relationships to their communities? Through slow and careful readings of literary fiction and critical theory, we examine the ‘troubling’ heroines presented in prose fiction works by francophone Caribbean authors of both genders, considering the thematic intersections and common formal strategies that emerge in their writing. We consider in particular the symbolic value of the ‘zombie,’ the ‘witch,’ the ‘goddess,’ and other provocative characters as so many reflections on–and of–social phenomena that mark the region and its history.\n",
      "AFAM 372 Post Black Art and Beyond. Nana Adusei-Poku. In 2001, \"Freestyle\", a survey exhibition curated by Thelma Golden at the Studio Museum in Harlem, introduced a young generation of artists of African descent and the ambitious yet knowingly opaque term post-black to a pre-9-11 pre-Obama world. This seminar utilizes the term post-black as a starting point to investigate the different ways Black Artists identified themselves through the lens of their historical contexts, writings, and politics while engaging with key debates around Black Aesthetics in exhibitions and theory. Consequently, we discuss changes in artistic styles and Black identity discourses from the beginning of the 20th century into the present. Post-black stirred much controversy 22 years ago because it was used by a generation of artists who seemed to distance themselves from previous generations, who utilized the term Black to define their practices as a form of political resistance. However, the claims that the post-black generation made, and the influence of their work is part of an ongoing debate in African Diasporic Art, which has refreshed and posed new questions for art-historical research as well as curation. Topics include Representation, Black Exhibition Histories, Black Aesthetics, Afrotropes, Afro-politanism, Abstraction vs. Figuration, Curation as an Art-Historical tool, The Black Radical Tradition and Racial Uplift, post-race vs. post-black and historical consistencies.\n",
      "AFAM 397 New Developments in Global African Diaspora Studies. Fatima El-Tayeb. This course traces recent developments in African Diaspora Theory, among them Afropessimism, Queer of Color Critique, Black Trans Studies and Afropolitanism. We pay particular attention to interactions between theory, art, and activism. The scope is transnational with a focus on, but not restricted to, the Anglophone DiasporaTexts. Each session roughly follows this structure: One theoretical text representing a recent development in African diaspora studies, one earlier key text that the reading builds on, one theoretical text that does not necessarily fall under the category of diaspora studies but speaks to our topic and one text that relates to the topic but uses a non-theoretical format. Students are expected to develop their own thematically related project over the course of the semester.\n",
      "AFAM 413 Samuel Delany and His Worlds. Tav Nyong'o. Exploration of sex, science fiction, and the downtown scene in New York City, through the archives and writings of Samuel R. Delany.

      "AFAM 455 Anti-Racist Curriculum and Pedagogy. Daniel HoSang. This seminar explores the pedagogical and conceptual tools, resources and frameworks used to teach about race and racism at the primary and secondary levels, across diverse disciplines and subject areas. Moving beyond the more limited paradigms of racial colorblindness and diversity, the seminar introduces curricular strategies for centering race and racism in ways that are accessible to students from a broad range of backgrounds, and that work to advance the overall goals of the curriculum.\n",
      "AFAM 457 Racial Republic: African Diasporic Literature and Culture in Postcolonial France. Fadila Habchi. This is an interdisciplinary seminar on French cultural history from the 1930s to the present. We focus on issues concerning race and gender in the context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and migration. The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness. Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.\n",
      "AFAM 479 Music of the Caribbean: Cuba and Jamaica. Michael Veal. An examination of the Afro-diasporic music cultures of Cuba and Jamaica, placing the historical succession of musical genres and traditions into social, cultural, and political contexts. Cuban genres studied include religious/folkloric traditions (Lucumi/Santeria and Abakua), rumba, son, mambo, pachanga/charanga, salsa, timba and reggaeton. Jamaican genres studied include: folkloric traditions (etu/tambu/kumina), Jamaican R&B, ska, rock steady, reggae, ragga/dancehall. Prominent themes include: slavery, Afro-diasporic cultural traditions, Black Atlantic culture, nationalism/independence/post-colonial culture, relationships with the United States, music & gender/sexuality, technology.\n",

      "AFAM 491 The Senior Essay. Elizabeth Hinton. Independent research on the senior essay. The senior essay form must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the end of the second week of classes. The senior essay should be completed according to the following schedule: (1) end of the sixth week of classes: a rough draft of the entire essay; (2) end of the last week of classes (fall term) or three weeks before the end of classes (spring term): two copies of the final version of the essay.\n",
      "AFAM 500 Global Black Aesthetics. Tav Nyong'o. Given the planetary scope increasingly implicit in contemporary art practice and the art world, this course asks after the relationship between politics and aesthetics in the current moment of planetary crisis. Critical discussion of the relation between aesthetics and politics is often framed as solely a question of enhancing democratic participation and emancipating publics. However, this approach is limited and does not sufficiently account for colonial modernity’s role in the construction of the aesthetic, as well as its role in political relegating and regulating populations as dispossessed and disenfranchised. Readings include contemporary black aesthetic theories of refusal, fabulation, and poetics and draw on readings from Denise Ferreira da Silva, Fred Moten, Tina Campt, Saidiya Hartman, Christina Sharpe, John Keene, Dionne Brand, Édouard Glissant, and Sylvia Wynter.\n",
      "AFAM 505 Theorizing Racial Formations. Erica Edwards. A required course for all first-year students in the combined Ph.D. program in African American Studies; also open to students in American Studies. This interdisciplinary reading seminar focuses on new work that is challenging the temporal, theoretical, and spatial boundaries of the field.\n",
      "AFAM 522 The Beautiful Struggle: Blackness, the Archive, and the Speculative. Daphne Brooks. This seminar takes its inspiration from concepts and questions centering theories that engage experimental methodological approaches to navigating the opacities of the archive: presumptively \"lost\" narratives of black life, obscure(d) histories, compromised voices and testimonials, contested (auto)biographies, anonymous testimonies, textual aporias, fabulist documents, confounding marginalia. The scholarly and aesthetic modes by which a range of critics and poets, novelists, dramatists, and historians have grappled with such material have given birth to new analytic lexicons—from Saidiya Hartman’s \"critical fabulation\" to José Estaban Muñoz’s \"ephemera as evidence\" to Tavia Nyong’o’s \"Afrofabulation.\" Such strategies affirm the centrality of speculative thought and invention as vital and urgent forms of epistemic intervention in the hegemony of the archive and open new lines of inquiry in black studies. Our class explores a variety of texts that showcase these new queries and innovations, and we also actively center our efforts from within the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, where a number of sessions are held and where we focus on Beinecke holdings that resonate with units of the course. Various sessions also feature distinguished guest interlocutors via Zoom, who are on hand to discuss the specifics of their research methods and improvisational experimentations in both archival exploration and approaches to their prose and poetic projects.\n",
      "AFAM 687 Race in American Studies. Matthew Jacobson. This reading-intensive seminar examines influential scholarship across disciplines on \"the race concept\" and racialized relations in American culture and society. Major topics include the cultural construction of race; race as both an instrument of oppressions and an idiom of resistance in American politics; the centrality of race in literary, anthropological, and legal discourse; the racialization of U.S. foreign policy; \"race mixing\" and \"passing,\" vicissitudes of \"whiteness\" in American politics; the centrality of race in American political culture; and \"race\" in the realm of popular cultural representation. Writings under investigation include classic formulations by such scholars as Lawrence Levine and Ronald Takaki, as well as more recent work by Saidiya Hartman, Robin Kelley, and Ann Fabian. Seminar papers give students an opportunity to explore in depth the themes, periods, and methods that most interest them.\n",
      "AFAM 738 Readings in African American Women’s History. The diversity of African American women’s lives from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. Using primary and secondary sources we explore the social, political, cultural, and economic factors that produced change and transformation in the lives of African American women. Through history, fiction, autobiography, art, religion, film, music, and cultural criticism we discuss and explore the construction of African American women’s activism and feminism; the racial politics of the body, beauty, and complexion; hetero- and same-sex sexualities; intraracial class relations; and the politics of identity, family, and work.\n",
      "AFAM 764 Readings in Nineteenth-Century America. David Blight. The course explores recent trends and historiography on several problems through the middle of the nineteenth century: sectionalism, expansion; slavery and the Old South; northern society and reform movements; Civil War causation; the meaning of the Confederacy; why the North won the Civil War; the political, constitutional, and social meanings of emancipation and Reconstruction; violence in Reconstruction society; the relationships between social/cultural and military/political history; problems in historical memory; the tension between narrative and analytical history writing; and the ways in which race and gender have reshaped research and interpretive agendas.\n",
      "AFAM 771 The American Carceral State. Elizabeth Hinton. This readings course examines the historical development of the U.S. carceral state, focusing on policing practices, crime control policies, prison conditions, and the production of scientific knowledge in the twentieth century. Key works are considered to understand the connections between race and the development of legal and penal systems over time, as well as how scholars have explained the causes and consequences of mass incarceration in America. Drawing from key insights from new histories in the field of American carceral studies, we trace the multifaceted ways in which policymakers and officials at all levels of government have used criminal law, policing, and imprisonment as proxies for exerting social control in communities of color throughout U.S. history.\n",
      "AFAM 773 Workshop in Urban Ethnography. Elijah Anderson. The ethnographic interpretation of urban life and culture. Conceptual and methodological issues are discussed.

Presenters may request a video recording if they can benefit from seeing themselves present (e.g., for a practice talk).\n",
      "AFAM 820 A Greater Caribbean: New Approaches to Caribbean History. Anne Eller. We engage with new work emerging about the Greater Caribbean in the context of Latin America, the African diaspora, Atlantic history, global history, comparative emancipation from chattel slavery, and the study of global revolutions. Students make in-class presentations that locate these titles in a deeper historiography with classic texts. This course crosses imperial boundaries of archives and historiography in order to consider the intersecting allegiances, identities, itineraries, and diaspora of peoples, in local, hemispheric, and global context. Some central questions include: What is the lived geography of the Caribbean at different moments, and how does using different geographic and temporary frameworks help approach the region’s history? What role did people living in this amorphously demarcated region play in major historical transformations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? How did the varied but interconnected processes of Caribbean emancipation impact economic and political systems throughout the Atlantic and beyond?\n",
      "AFAM 860 Ecologies of Black Print. Jacqueline Goldsby. A survey of history of the book scholarship germane to African American literature and the ecosystems that have sustained black print cultures over time. Secondary works consider eighteenth- to twenty-first-century black print culture practices, print object production, modes of circulation, consumption, and reception. Students write critical review essays, design research projects, and write fellowship proposals based on archival work at the Beinecke Library, Schomburg Center, and other regional sites (e.g., the Sterling A. Brown papers at Williams College).\n",
      "AFAM 867 Black Iberia: Then and Now. Nicholas Jones. This graduate seminar examines the variety of artistic, cultural, historical, and literary representations of black Africans and their descendants—both enslaved and free—across the vast stretches of the Luso-Hispanic world and the United States. Taking a chronological frame, the course begins its study of Blackness in medieval and early modern Iberia and its colonial kingdoms. From there, we examine the status of Blackness conceptually and ideologically in Asia, the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. Toward the end of the semester, we concentrate on black Africans by focusing on Equatorial Guinea, sub-Saharan African immigration in present-day Portugal and Spain, and the politics of Afro-Latinx culture and its identity politics in the United States. Throughout the term, we interrogate the following topics in order to guide our class discussions and readings: bondage and enslavement, fugitivity and maroonage, animal imageries and human-animal studies, geography and maps, Black Feminism and Black Queer Studies, material and visual cultures (e.g., beauty ads, clothing, cosmetics, food, Blackface performance, royal portraiture, reality TV, and music videos), the Inquisition and African diasporic religions, and dispossession and immigration. Our challenging task remains the following: to see how Blackness conceptually and experientially is subversively fluid and performative, yet deceptive and paradoxical. This course will be taught in English, with all materials available in the original (English, Portuguese, Spanish) and in English translation.\n",

      "AFST 277 Introduction to Critical Border Studies. Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen. This course serves as an introduction into the major themes and approaches to the study of border enforcement and the management of human mobility. We draw upon a diverse range of scholarship across the social sciences as well as history, architecture, and philosophy to better understand how we find ourselves in this present \"age of walls\" (Tim Marshall 2019). In addition, we take a comparative approach to the study of borders—examining specific contemporary and historical cases across the world in order to gain a comprehensive view of what borders are and how their meaning and function has changed over time. And because there is \"critical\" in the title, we explicitly evaluate the political consequences of borders, examine the sorts of resistances mobilized against them, and ask what alternative social and political worlds might be possible.\n",

This course introduces students to oral and written literature by/for and/or about children in Africa: from its oral origins in riddles, lullabies, playground verse, and folk narratives, to written texts in the form of drama, poetry, and prose. The course examines representative texts of the genre to address its historical background/development and explore its distinctive (literary) qualities. Major themes and social issues that are dealt with in African children’s literature (including cultural notions of childhood, gender, and power) as well as critical approaches to the genre are considered.\n",

      "AFST 385 Pandemics in Africa: From the Spanish Influenza to Covid-19. Jonny Steinberg. The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.\n",

      "AFST 457 Racial Republic: African Diasporic Literature and Culture in Postcolonial France. Fadila Habchi. This is an interdisciplinary seminar on French cultural history from the 1930s to the present. We focus on issues concerning race and gender in the context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and migration. The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness. Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.\n",
      "AFST 465 Infrastructures of Empire: Control and (In)security in the Global South. Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen. This advanced seminar examines the role that infrastructure plays in producing uneven geographies of power historically and in the \"colonial present\" (Gregory 2006). After defining terms and exploring the ways that infrastructure has been conceptualized and studied, we analyze how different types of infrastructure (energy, roads, people, and so on) constitute the material and social world of empire. At the same time, infrastructure is not an uncontested arena: it often serves as a key site of political struggle or even enters the fray as an unruly actor itself, thus conditioning possibilities for anti-imperial and decolonial practice. The geographic focus of this course is the African continent, but we explore comparative cases in other regions of the majority and minority world.\n",

This course provides a deep foundation for understanding these pathogens and explores the public health issues that surround these infectious diseases in resource-limited settings. Emphasis is placed on issues in Africa, but contrasts for each disease are provided in the broader developing world. The course is divided into three sections, each focusing in depth on the individual infectious disease as well as discussions of interactions among the three diseases. The sections consist of three to four lectures each on the biology, individual consequences, and community/public health impact of each infectious disease. Discussion of ongoing, field-based research projects involving the diseases is led by relevant faculty (research into practice). The course culminates with a critical discussion of major public health programmatic efforts to tackle these diseases, such as those of PEPFAR, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Fund, and the Stop TB Partnership.\n",

      "AFST 719 Christianity and Coloniality in Contemporary Africa. Kyama Mugambi. Missionary complicity with the colonial enterprise puts Christianity at the heart of the problematic relationship between the African continent and the West. At the same time, Christianity has continued to grow rapidly in post-independence Africa. In much of Africa south of the Sahara, decolonization efforts coincided with the period of the greatest Christian expansion in history. Africa is now the continent with the highest population of Christians. This course examines this conundrum through critical engagement with theory, literature, and data from the continent. Students examine historiographic, political, social, economic, and demographic dimensions of this discussion. They meet key theories posited with regard to African Christianity in the wake of a colonial history. The course surveys contemporary issues in the discourse within the urban, educational, social, and cultural spheres. Students also consider gender perspectives on coloniality as it pertains to religion and politics. The course assesses the role of indigenous agency in the development of Christianity within contemporary Africa. Through this course students will gain a more nuanced perspective as they examine and problematize critical arguments in the prevailing discourse on Christianity and coloniality in Africa today. Area III, Area V.\n",
      "AFST 779 2000 Years of Christianity in Africa: A History of the African Church. Kyama Mugambi. The rapid, previously unexpected growth of Christianity in Africa in the twentieth century calls for deeper scholarly reflection. Keen students of global trends are aware that Africa is now home to more Christians than Europe or North America. While the rapid growth can be traced to a century of vigorous activity, Christianity has a long eventful history on the continent. This course provides a broad overview of Christianity in Africa over two millennia. The early part of the course focuses on the beginnings and development of the Church in Africa. The material highlights the role of African Christian thinkers in shaping early Christian discourses in increasingly dynamic global and continental contexts. The course weaves critical themes emerging in African Christianity north of the expansive Sahara desert, and then south of it. Students encounter critical issues in missionary Christianity in Africa and gain a historical understanding of the milestones in Christian growth that contribute to Christianity’s status as both an African and global religion. Area III.\n",
      "AFST 833 Agrarian History of Africa. Robert Harms. This course examines changes in African rural life from precolonial times to the present.

      "AFST 889 Postcolonial Ecologies. Cajetan Iheka. This seminar examines the intersections of postcolonialism and ecocriticism as well as the tensions between these conceptual nodes, with readings drawn from across the global South. Topics of discussion include colonialism, development, resource extraction, globalization, ecological degradation, nonhuman agency, and indigenous cosmologies. The course is concerned with the narrative strategies affording the illumination of environmental ideas. We begin by engaging with the questions of postcolonial and world literature and return to these throughout the semester as we read primary texts, drawn from Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia. We consider African ecologies in their complexity from colonial through post-colonial times. In the unit on the Caribbean, we take up the transformations of the landscape from slavery, through colonialism, and the contemporary era. Turning to Asian spaces, the seminar explores changes brought about by modernity and globalization as well as the effects on both humans and nonhumans. Readings include the writings of Zakes Mda, Aminatta Forna, Helon Habila, Derek Walcott, Jamaica Kincaid, Ishimure Michiko, and Amitav Ghosh. The course prepares students to respond to key issues in postcolonial ecocriticism and the environmental humanities, analyze the work of the major thinkers in the fields, and examine literary texts and other cultural productions from a postcolonial perspective. Course participants have the option of selecting from a variety of final projects. Students can craft an original essay that analyzes primary text from a postcolonial and/or ecocritical perspective. Such work should aim at producing new insight on a theoretical concept and/or the cultural text. They can also produce an undergraduate syllabus for a course at the intersection of postcolonialism and environmentalism or write a review essay discussing three recent monographs focused on postcolonial ecocriticism.\n",
      "AKKD 110 Elementary Akkadian I. Parker Zane. Akkadian was one of the primary languages of ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), with an attested history of more than 2000 years (from the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE to the beginning of the Common Era). It is a Semitic language, similar to Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew, written on clay tablets in the Cuneiform script. Hundreds of thousands of documents in Akkadian have come down to us. They include everything from great works of literature like the Gilgamesh Epic, to everyday texts such as letters that document the lives of people from all walks of life, from great kings to commoners and slaves. Whether it be a letter to a paranoid emperor who refuses to eat and shuts himself in his own palace, or a particularly inept spy reporting to his superiors about the suspicious dreams of a suspected enemy of the state, knowledge of Akkadian opens a window into the world of those who lived thousands of years ago, the struggles they faced and the stories they told. Akkadian for Beginners provides students with the tools to begin to explore that ancient and once-forgotten world of ancient Mesopotamia. After finishing the course, students will have acquired a sound knowledge of Akkadian grammar and syntax, along with practice in Cuneiform.\n",

      "AMST 032 Gender, Sexuality, and U.S. Empire. Talya Zemach-Bersin. This course explores the cultural history of America’s relationship to the world across the long twentieth century with particular attention to the significance of gender, sexuality, and race. We locate U.S. culture and politics within an international dynamic, exposing the interrelatedness of domestic and foreign affairs. While exploring specific geopolitical events like the Spanish-American War, World War I and II, and the Cold War, this course emphasizes the political importance of culture and ideology rather than offering a formal overview of U.S. foreign policy. How have Americans across the twentieth century drawn from ideas about gender to understand their country’s relationship to the wider world? In what ways have gendered ideologies and gendered approaches to politics shaped America’s performance on the world’s stage? How have geopolitical events impacted the construction of race and gender on the home front? In the most general sense, this course is designed to encourage students to understand American cultural and gender history as the product of America’s engagement with the world. In so doing, we explore the rise of U.S. global power as an enterprise deeply related to conceptions of race, sexuality, and gender. We also examine films, political speeches, visual culture, music, and popular culture.\n",
      "AMST 040 Bob Dylan as a Way of Life. Benjamin Barasch. An introduction to college-level study of the humanities through intensive exploration of the songs of Bob Dylan. We touch on Dylan’s place in American cultural history but mostly treat him as a great creative artist, tracking him through various guises and disguises across his sixty-year odyssey of self-fashioning, from ‘60s folk revivalist to voice of social protest, abrasive rock ‘n’ roll surrealist to honey-voiced country crooner, loving husband to lovesick drifter, secular Jew to born-again Christian to worldly skeptic, honest outlaw to Nobel Prize-winning chronicler of modern times and philosopher of song. Throughout, we attend to Dylan’s lifelong quest for wisdom and reflect on how it can inspire our own. Topics include: the elusiveness of identity and the need for selfhood; virtue and vice; freedom and servitude; reverence and irreverence; love, desire, and betrayal; faith and unbelief; aging, death, and the possibility of immortality; the authentic and the counterfeit; the nature of beauty and of artistic genius; the meaning of personal integrity in a political world.\n",

Taught in the Beinecke Library with the assistance of curators and librarians, each week is organized around an archival collection that sheds light on the history of slavery. The course also includes visits to the Department of Manuscripts and Archives in the Sterling Library, the British Art Center, and the Yale University Art Gallery.  Each student writes a research paper grounded in archival research in one of the Yale Libraries. Topics include slavery and slaveholding, the transatlantic slave trade, resistance to slavery, the abolitionist movement, the coming of the American Civil War, the process of emancipation, and post-emancipation experiences.\n",
      "AMST 099 Asian Americans and STEM. Eun-Joo Ahn. As both objects of study and agents of discovery, Asian Americans have played an important yet often unseen role in fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in the U.S. Now more than ever, there is a need to rethink and educate students on science’s role in society and its interface with society. This course unites the humanities fields of Asian American history and American Studies with the STEM fields of medicine, physics, and computer science to explore the ways in which scientific practice has been shaped by U.S. histories of imperialism and colonialism, migration and racial exclusion, domestic and international labor and economics, and war. The course also explores the scientific research undertaken in these fields and delves into key scientific principles and concepts to understand the impact of such work on the lives of Asians and Asian Americans, and how the migration of people may have impacted the migration of ideas and scientific progress. Using case students, students engage with fundamental scientific concepts in these fields. They explore key roles Asians and Asian Americans had in the development in science and technology in the United States and around the world as well as the impact of state policies regarding the migration of technical labor and the concerns over brain drains. Students also examine diversity and inclusion in the context of the experiences of Asians and Asian Americans in STEM.\n",

      "AMST 225 Writing American Studies: Food as Story & Critical Lens. Alison Kibbe. This writing seminar examines food as an entry to the interdisciplinary approaches of American Studies. We explore how food can help us think critically about our world, as well as how we can write critically about food. Food serves as a useful entry point to interdisciplinary American and Ethnic Studies because centering food requires that we think across history, cultural studies, anthropology, science, ecology, aesthetics, embodiment, and more. Through food studies we gain a unique understanding of the peoples, cultures, plants, animals, mobilities, and flavors that shape societies, communities, and individuals. With a focus on Caribbean, Black, Latinx, and indigenous perspectives, we use critical food studies to examine questions about place, history, racial formations, migration, and above all, different approaches to writing, drafting, editing, and re-writing.\n",

This course examines the causes and the consequences of American global power in the \"long 20th century,\" peeking back briefly into the 19th century as well as forward into the present one. The focus is on foreign relations, which includes but is not limited to foreign policy; indeed, America’s global role was rooted as much in its economic and cultural power as it was in diplomacy and military strength. We study events like wars, crises, treaties, and summits—but also trade shows and movie openings. Our principal subjects include plenty of State Department officials, but also missionaries, business people, and journalists. We pay close attention also to conceptions of American power; how did observers in and beyond the United States understand the nature, origins, and operations of American power?\n",

This course traces the birth and evolution of Black arts writing and criticism−its style and content, its major themes and groundbreaking practices−from the late nineteenth century through the 2020s. From the innovations of W.E.B. DuBois, Pauline Hopkins, and postbellum Black arts journalists to the breakthroughs of Harlem Renaissance heavyweights (Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and others), from the jazz experimentalism of Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray to the revolutionary criticism of Amiri Baraka, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Phyl Garland and others, this class explores the intellectual work of pioneering writers who produced radical knowledge about Black culture. Its second half turns to the late twentieth and twenty-first century criticism of legendary arts journalists, scholars and critics: Toni Morrison, Thulani Davis, Margo Jefferson, Hilton Als, Greg Tate, Farah J. Griffin, Joan Morgan, Danyel Smith, Wesley Morris, Hanif Abdurraqib, and others. Emphasis will be placed on music, literary, film, and theater/performance arts writing.\n",

      "AMST 258 Wilderness in the North American Imagination: Landscapes of the US Nuclear-Industrial Complex. Charlotte Hecht. Since the mid-twentieth century, the drive for nuclear power—in the form of weapons and energy—has irreversibly shaped the landscapes of the North American continent, and the world. The activities of the nuclear fuel cycle (uranium mining and milling, weapons testing and production, and radioactive waste dumping) have reached every state in the country, often in devastating and uneven ways. Today, debates about nuclear weapons and the benefits of nuclear power are at the forefront of contemporary discourse. This course contextualizes these impacts and debates in the long history of post-war industrialization and militarization, a history that begins with 19th century settler-colonial conceptions of \"wilderness.\" Throughout the course, we investigate how cultural imaginaries of wilderness (and ideas about nature, landscape, space, and environment) are deeply related to the uneven geographies of the nuclear industrial complex, and the intersections of US imperialism, militarism, extractive capitalism, and environmental racism. Alongside this, we consider how artists, activists, and scholars are working to theorize, reframe, and reimagine the legacies of the nuclear industry.\n",
      "AMST 263 Place, Race, and Memory in Schools. Errol Saunders. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement and widespread, multiracial protests calling for racial justice across the United States, there is a renewed interest in the roles that schools play in perpetuating racial disparities in American society and the opportunities that education writ large might provide for remedying them. As places, schools both shape and are profoundly shaped by the built environment and the everyday experiences of the people that interact with them. Teachers, administrators, students, and parents are impacted by the racialized memories to explain the past, justify the present, and to move them to action for the future. These individual and collective memories of who and where they are, and the traumas, successes, failures, and accomplishments that they have with regard to school and education are essential to understanding how schools and school reforms work. Grounded in four different geographies, this course examines how the interrelationships of place, race, and memory are implicated in reforms of preK-12 schools in the United States. The course uses an interdisciplinary approach to study these phenomena, borrowing from commensurate frameworks in sociology, anthropology, political science, and memory studies with the goal of examining multiple angles and perspectives on a given issue.\n",

      "AMST 305 Digital War. From drones and autonomous robots to algorithmic warfare, virtual war gaming, and data mining, digital war has become a key pressing issue of our times and an emerging field of study. This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.\n",
      "AMST 308 Literatures of the Plague. Jim Berger. In a new era of pandemic, we have seen how widespread medical crisis has profound effects on individual life and consciousness, and on political and economic institutions and practices. Our material and psychic supply chains grow tenuous. All of life changes even as we try to preserve what we deem most valuable. We must rethink what we consider to be \"essential.\" Yet this is far from being a new condition. Infectious disease has been part of the human social world probably since the beginnings of urban life. The Bible describes plagues sent by God as punishment. The earliest historical depiction was by Thucydides shortly after the plague in Athens in 430 BCE. At each occasion, people have tried to witness and to understand these \"visitations,\" as Daniel Defoe called them. The Plague is always a medical, political, economic and an interpretive crisis. It is also a moral crisis, as people must not only try to understand but also determine how to act. This course studies accounts of pandemics, from Thucydides in Athens up to our ongoing Coronavirus outbreaks. We trace the histories of understanding that accompanied pandemics: religious, scientific, philosophical, ethical, literary. It seems to be the case that these vast, horrifying penetrations of death into the fabric of life have inspired some of our fragile and resilient species’ most strange and profound meditations.\n",
      "AMST 319 The Modernist Novel in the 1920s. Joe Cleary. Many of the classics of modernist fiction were published between 1920 and 1930. These novels did not come into the world as \"modernist\"; that term was later conferred on narrative experiments often considered bizarre at the time. As writers, the \"modernists\" did not conform to pre-existing social conceptions of \"the writer\" nor work with established systems of narrative genres; rather, they tried to remake the novel as form and bend it to new purposes. This course invites students to consider diverse morphologies of the Anglophone modernist novel in this decade and to reflect on its consequences for later developments in twentieth-century fiction. The seminar encourages careful analyses of individual texts but engages also with literary markets, patronage systems, changing world literary systems, the rise of cinema and mass and consumer cultures, and later Cold War constructions of the ideology of modernism.\n",
      "AMST 328 \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy:\" Paranoia and Conspiracy Theories in 20th and 21st C. America. In this course we examine the development and growth of conspiracy theories in American politics and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We look at texts from a variety of different analytical and political traditions to develop an understanding of how and why conspiracy theories develop, their structural dynamics, and how they function as a narrative. We examine a variety of different conspiracy theories and conspiratorial groups from across the political spectrum, but we pay particular attention to anti-Semitism as a foundational form of conspiracy theorizing, as well as the particular role of conspiracy theories in far-right politics, ranging from the John Birch Society in the 1960s to the Tea Party, QAnon, and beyond in the 21st century. We also look at how real conspiracies shape and reinforce conspiracy theorizing as a mode of thought, and formulate ethical answers on how to address conspiracy as a mode of politics.\n",
      "AMST 332 Humbugs and Visionaries: American Artists and Writers Before the Civil War. This course examines American literature and visual culture in the years before the Civil War, focusing on the ways that writers and artists not only anticipated but helped construct the modern era. We look in particular at mythmakers, prophets and self-promoters, from poets like Phillis Wheatley and Emily Dickinson, to painters like Thomas Cole and Hudson River School artists, to popular entertainers like P. T. Barnum. Topics include: visuality and the invention of \"whiteness\"; landscape and empire; genre painting and hegemony; race and double-coding; domesticity and sentimentalism.\n",
      "AMST 336 LGBTQ Life Spans. Scott Herring. Interdisciplinary survey of LGBTQ life spans in the United States concentrating primarily on later life. Special attention paid to topics such as disability, aging, and ageism; queer and trans creative aging; longevity and life expectancy during the AIDS epidemic; intergenerational intimacy; age and activism; critiques of optimal aging; and the development of LGBTQ senior centers and affordable senior housing. We explore these topics across multiple contemporary genres: documentary film (The Joneses), graphic memoir (Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home), poetry (Essex Hemphill’s \"Vital Signs\"), fabulation (Saidiya Hartman’s Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments), and oral history. We also review archival documents of later LGBTQ lives—ordinary and iconic—held at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library as well as the Lesbian Herstory Archives.\n",
      "AMST 345 Latinx Ethnography. Ana Ramos-Zayas. Consideration of ethnography within the genealogy and intellectual traditions of Latinx Studies.

      "AMST 350 Drama in Diaspora: South Asian American Theater and Performance. Shilarna Stokes. South Asian Americans have appeared on U.S. stages since the late nineteenth century, yet only in the last quarter century have plays and performances by South Asian Americans begun to dismantle dominant cultural representations of South Asian and South Asian American communities and to imagine new ways of belonging. This seminar introduces you to contemporary works of performance (plays, stand-up sets, multimedia events) written and created by U.S.-based artists of South Asian descent as well as artists of the South Asian diaspora whose works have had an impact on U.S. audiences. With awareness that the South Asian American diaspora comprises multiple, contested, and contingent identities, we investigate how artists have worked to manifest complex representations of South Asian Americans onstage, challenge institutional and professional norms, and navigate the perils and pleasures of becoming visible. No prior experience with or study of theater/performance required. Students in all years and majors welcome.\n",
      "AMST 360 Inequality in the Anthropocene: Thinking the Unthinkable. Kate McNally, Kathryn Dudley.

Final projects involve creative, artistic, multimedia field research.\n",
      "AMST 361 Comparative Colonialisms. Lisa Lowe. In this interdisciplinary seminar, students examine several historical and ongoing modes of colonialism—settler colonialism, slavery, and overseas empire, as well as their various contestations—approaching the study through readings in history, anthropology, political economy, literature, arts, and other materials. We discuss questions such as: In what ways are settler colonialism, slavery, and empire independent, and in what ways do they articulate with one another? How have colonialisms been integral to the emergence of the modern U.S. nation-state and economy? How does one read the national archive and engage the epistemology of evidence? What are the roles of cultural practices, narrative, and visual arts in countering colonial power?\n",
      "AMST 365 Platforms and Cultural Production. Platforms—digital infrastructures that serve as intermediaries between end-users and complementors—have emerged in various cultural and economic settings, from social media (Instagram), and video streaming (YouTube), to digital labor (Uber), and e-commerce (Amazon). This seminar provides a multidisciplinary lens to study platforms as hybrids of firms and multi-sided markets with unique history, governance, and infrastructures. The thematic sessions of this course discuss how platforms have transformed cultural production and connectivity, labor, creativity, and democracy by focusing on comparative cases from the United States and abroad. The seminar provides a space for broader discussions on contemporary capitalism and cultural production around topics such as inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and ethics. Students are encouraged to bring examples and case studies from their personal experiences.\n",

      "AMST 430 Muslims in the United States. Zareena Grewal. Since 9/11, cases of what has been termed \"home-grown terrorism\" have cemented the fear that \"bad\" Islam is not just something that exists far away, in distant lands. As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation. Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others. By focusing on a range of communities-in-motion and a diverse set of cultural texts, students explore the ways mobility, loss, and communal identity are conceptualized by immigrants, expatriates, refugees, guest-workers, religious seekers, and exiles. To this end, we read histories, ethnographies, essays, policy papers, novels, poetry, memoirs; we watch documentary and fictional films; we listen to music, speeches, spoken word performances, and prayers. Our aim is to deepen our understanding of the multiple meanings and conceptual limits of homeland and diaspora for Muslims in America, particularly in the Age of Terror.\n",
      "AMST 438 Caribbean Diasporic Literature. Fadila Habchi. An examination of contemporary literature written by Caribbean writers who have migrated to, or who journey between, different countries around the Atlantic rim.

      "AMST 439 Fruits of Empire. Gary Okihiro. Readings, discussions, and research on imperialism and \"green gold\" and their consequences for the imperial powers and their colonies and neo-colonies. Spatially conceived as a world-system that enmeshes the planet and as earth's latitudes that divide the temperate from the tropical zones, imperialism as discourse and material relations is this seminar's focus together with its implantations—an empire of plants. Vast plantations of sugar, cotton, tea, coffee, bananas, and pineapples occupy land cultivated by native and migrant workers, and their fruits move from the tropical to the temperate zones, impoverishing the periphery while profiting the core. Fruits of Empire, thus, implicates power and the social formation of race, gender, sexuality, class, and nation.\n",
      "AMST 448 Samuel Delany and His Worlds. Tav Nyong'o. Exploration of sex, science fiction, and the downtown scene in New York City, through the archives and writings of Samuel R. Delany.

It is concerned with their relationship of documentary to traditional scholarly written histories as well as the history of the genre and what is often called the \"archival turn.\"\n",
      "AMST 452 Mobility, Race, and U.S. Settler Colonialism. Laura Barraclough. This research seminar explores the significance of movement in the making of settler colonial nation-states, as well as contemporary public history projects that interpret those histories of mobility. To do so, it brings together the fields of settler colonial studies, critical Indigenous studies, ethnic studies, public history, and mobility studies. After acquainting ourselves with key debates within each of these fields, we examine case studies from various regions of the settler United States and diverse Indigenous nations. Our goal is to deepen awareness of the complex ways that movements–voluntary and forced, and by settlers, Natives, migrants, and people of color–are reproduced and remembered (or not) in public memory, and how these memories reproduce or destabilize settler colonialism’s social and cultural structures.\n",
      "AMST 461 Identity, Diversity, and Policy in U.S. Education. Craig Canfield. Introduction to critical theory (feminism, queer theory, critical race theory, disability studies, trans studies, indigenous studies) as a fundamental tool for understanding and critiquing identity, diversity, and policy in U.S. education.

      "AMST 470 Racial Republic: African Diasporic Literature and Culture in Postcolonial France. Fadila Habchi. This is an interdisciplinary seminar on French cultural history from the 1930s to the present. We focus on issues concerning race and gender in the context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and migration. The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness. Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.\n",

This required seminar for incoming first-year graduate students in the American Studies doctoral program focuses on varieties of scholarship and research methods employed in the field. The course aims to be both a history of the interdisciplinary American Studies field and an exploration of newer debates, approaches, and frameworks that engage and revise earlier objects, areas, historical timelines, methods, and periods. Beyond the narratives of United States exceptionalism, we engage American Studies scholarship that considers U.S. culture, history, and politics in relation to the histories of slavery, settler colonialism, capitalism, race, gender, sexuality, subcultures, war and empire. To explore the various kinds of approaches and projects, the seminar features visits from Yale scholars. Students will read 100 pages of visiting scholars’ work and collaborate on topical and thematic questions for discussion. Assignments include brief weekly writing assignments. This course is mandatory for first-year American Studies graduate students.\n",

      "AMST 622 Working Group on Globalization and Culture. Michael Denning. A continuing yearlong collective research project, a cultural studies \"laboratory.\" The group, drawing on several disciplines, meets regularly to discuss common readings, develop collective and individual research projects, and present that research publicly. The general theme for the working group is globalization and culture, with three principal aspects: (1) the globalization of cultural industries and goods, and its consequences for patterns of everyday life as well as for forms of fiction, film, broadcasting, and music; (2) the trajectories of social movements and their relation to patterns of migration, the rise of global cities, the transformation of labor processes, and forms of ethnic, class, and gender conflict; (3) the emergence of and debates within transnational social and cultural theory.

      "AMST 696 Michel Foucault I: The Works, The Interlocutors, The Critics. This graduate-level course presents students with the opportunity to develop a thorough, extensive, and deep (though still not exhaustive!) understanding of the oeuvre of Michel Foucault, and his impact on late-twentieth-century criticism and intellectual history in the United States. Non-francophone and/or U.S. American scholars, as Lynne Huffer has argued, have engaged Foucault’s work unevenly and frequently in a piecemeal way, due to a combination of the overemphasis on The History of Sexuality, Vol 1 (to the exclusion of most of his other major works), and the lack of availability of English translations of most of his writings until the early twenty-first century. This course seeks to correct that trend and to re-introduce Foucault’s works to a generation of graduate students who, on the whole, do not have extensive experience with his oeuvre. In this course, we read almost all of Foucault’s published writings that have been translated into English (which is almost all of them, at this point). We read all of the monographs, and all of the Collège de France lectures, in chronological order. This lightens the reading load; we read a book per week, but the lectures are shorter and generally less dense than the monographs. [The benefit of a single author course is that the more time one spends reading Foucault’s work, the easier reading his work becomes.] We read as many of the essays he published in popular and more widely-circulated media as we can. The goal of the course is to give students both breadth and depth in their understanding of Foucault and his works, and to be able to situate his thinking in relation to the intellectual, social, and political histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Alongside Foucault himself, we read Foucault’s mentors, interlocutors, and inheritors (Heidegger, Marx, Blanchot, Canguilhem, Derrida, Barthes, Althusser, Bersani, Hartman, Angela Davis, etc); his critics (Mbembe, Weheliye, Butler, Said, etc.), and scholarship that situates his thought alongside contemporary social movements, including student, Black liberation, prison abolitionist, and anti-psychiatry movements.\n",
      "AMST 701 Race in American Studies. Matthew Jacobson. This reading-intensive seminar examines influential scholarship across disciplines on \"the race concept\" and racialized relations in American culture and society. Major topics include the cultural construction of race; race as both an instrument of oppressions and an idiom of resistance in American politics; the centrality of race in literary, anthropological, and legal discourse; the racialization of U.S. foreign policy; \"race mixing\" and \"passing,\" vicissitudes of \"whiteness\" in American politics; the centrality of race in American political culture; and \"race\" in the realm of popular cultural representation. Writings under investigation include classic formulations by such scholars as Lawrence Levine and Ronald Takaki, as well as more recent work by Saidiya Hartman, Robin Kelley, and Ann Fabian. Seminar papers give students an opportunity to explore in depth the themes, periods, and methods that most interest them.\n",
      "AMST 702 Global Black Aesthetics. Tav Nyong'o. Given the planetary scope increasingly implicit in contemporary art practice and the art world, this course asks after the relationship between politics and aesthetics in the current moment of planetary crisis. Critical discussion of the relation between aesthetics and politics is often framed as solely a question of enhancing democratic participation and emancipating publics. However, this approach is limited and does not sufficiently account for colonial modernity’s role in the construction of the aesthetic, as well as its role in political relegating and regulating populations as dispossessed and disenfranchised. Readings include contemporary black aesthetic theories of refusal, fabulation, and poetics and draw on readings from Denise Ferreira da Silva, Fred Moten, Tina Campt, Saidiya Hartman, Christina Sharpe, John Keene, Dionne Brand, Édouard Glissant, and Sylvia Wynter.\n",
      "AMST 706 Readings in African American Women’s History. The diversity of African American women’s lives from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. Using primary and secondary sources we explore the social, political, cultural, and economic factors that produced change and transformation in the lives of African American women. Through history, fiction, autobiography, art, religion, film, music, and cultural criticism we discuss and explore the construction of African American women’s activism and feminism; the racial politics of the body, beauty, and complexion; hetero- and same-sex sexualities; intraracial class relations; and the politics of identity, family, and work.\n",
      "AMST 715 Readings in Nineteenth-Century America. David Blight. The course explores recent trends and historiography on several problems through the middle of the nineteenth century: sectionalism, expansion; slavery and the Old South; northern society and reform movements; Civil War causation; the meaning of the Confederacy; why the North won the Civil War; the political, constitutional, and social meanings of emancipation and Reconstruction; violence in Reconstruction society; the relationships between social/cultural and military/political history; problems in historical memory; the tension between narrative and analytical history writing; and the ways in which race and gender have reshaped research and interpretive agendas.\n",
      "AMST 721 The Beautiful Struggle: Blackness, the Archive, and the Speculative. Daphne Brooks. This seminar takes its inspiration from concepts and questions centering theories that engage experimental methodological approaches to navigating the opacities of the archive: presumptively \"lost\" narratives of black life, obscure(d) histories, compromised voices and testimonials, contested (auto)biographies, anonymous testimonies, textual aporias, fabulist documents, confounding marginalia. The scholarly and aesthetic modes by which a range of critics and poets, novelists, dramatists, and historians have grappled with such material have given birth to new analytic lexicons—from Saidiya Hartman’s \"critical fabulation\" to José Estaban Muñoz’s \"ephemera as evidence\" to Tavia Nyong’o’s \"Afrofabulation.\" Such strategies affirm the centrality of speculative thought and invention as vital and urgent forms of epistemic intervention in the hegemony of the archive and open new lines of inquiry in black studies. Our class explores a variety of texts that showcase these new queries and innovations, and we also actively center our efforts from within the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, where a number of sessions are held and where we focus on Beinecke holdings that resonate with units of the course. Various sessions also feature distinguished guest interlocutors via Zoom, who are on hand to discuss the specifics of their research methods and improvisational experimentations in both archival exploration and approaches to their prose and poetic projects.\n",
      "AMST 725 Writing the Academic Journal Article. Albert Laguna. Graduate students are often told that publishing a journal article is a crucial part of their professional development. This course helps students get it done. Students come to class with a piece of writing—seminar paper, dissertation chapter—that we workshop as a group throughout the course of the term. In addition to personalized feedback, we also have broader discussions about the nuts and bolts of this genre of academic writing: organizing your argument, revision, clarity, framing interventions, etc. We complement this structured approach to writing with discussions aimed at demystifying the process by which an article gets published—the art of selecting the right journal, how to read and respond to reader reports, and general timelines. The goal is for all students to submit their article to the journal of their choice by the end of the term.\n",
      "AMST 746 Ethnographic Writing. Kathryn Dudley. This course explores the practice of ethnographic analysis, writing, and representation. Through our reading of contemporary ethnographies and theoretical work on ethnographic fieldwork in anthropological and interdisciplinary research, we explore key approaches to intersubjective encounters, including phenomenological anthropology, relational psychoanalysis, affect studies, and the new materialisms. Our inquiries coalesce around the poetics and politics of what it means to sense and sensationalize co-present subjectivities, temporalities, and ontologies in multispecies worlds and global economies.\n",
      "AMST 775 Latinx Ethnography. Ana Ramos-Zayas. Consideration of ethnography within the genealogy and intellectual traditions of Latinx studies.

This course draws on perspectives from anthropology, history, American studies, religious studies, Indigenous studies, and postcolonial studies to interrogate the varied intersections between religion and US empire. It asks not only how Christianity and other religious traditions have facilitated imperialism and how they have served as resources for resistance, but also how the categories of \"religion\" and the \"secular\" have been assembled as imperial products alongside modern formations of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Through seminar discussions and written assignments, students gain new analytical tools along with critical purchase on an important new area for research in several intersecting fields of study.\n",
      "AMST 830 The American Carceral State. Elizabeth Hinton. This readings course examines the historical development of the U.S. carceral state, focusing on policing practices, crime control policies, prison conditions, and the production of scientific knowledge in the twentieth century. Key works are considered to understand the connections between race and the development of legal and penal systems over time, as well as how scholars have explained the causes and consequences of mass incarceration in America. Drawing from key insights from new histories in the field of American carceral studies, we trace the multifaceted ways in which policymakers and officials at all levels of government have used criminal law, policing, and imprisonment as proxies for exerting social control in communities of color throughout U.S. history.\n",

      "AMST 903 Introduction to Public Humanities. What is the relationship between knowledge produced in the university and the circulation of ideas among a broader public, between academic expertise on the one hand and nonprofessionalized ways of knowing and thinking on the other? What is possible? This seminar provides an introduction to various institutional relations and to the modes of inquiry, interpretation, and presentation by which practitioners in the humanities seek to invigorate the flow of information and ideas among a public more broadly conceived than the academy, its classrooms, and its exclusive readership of specialists. Topics include public history, museum studies, oral and community history, public art, documentary film and photography, public writing and educational outreach, the socially conscious performing arts, and fundraising. In addition to core readings and discussions, the seminar includes presentations by several practitioners who are currently engaged in different aspects of the Public Humanities. With the help of Yale faculty and affiliated institutions, participants collaborate in developing and executing a Public Humanities project of their own definition and design. Possibilities might include, but are not limited to, an exhibit or installation, a documentary, a set of walking tours, a website, a documents collection for use in public schools.\n",

      "ANTH 213 Contemporary Japan and the Ghosts of Modernity. Yukiko Koga. This course introduces students to contemporary Japan, examining how its defeat in the Second World War and loss of empire in 1945 continue to shape Japanese culture and society. Looking especially at the sphere of cultural production, it focuses on the question of what it means to be modern as expressed through the tension between resurgent neonationalism and the aspiration to internationalize. The course charts how the legacy of Japan’s imperial failure plays a significant role in its search for renewal and identity since 1945. How, it asks, does the experience of catastrophic failure—and failure to account for that failure—play into continued aspirations for modernity today? How does Japanese society wrestle with modernity’s two faces: its promise for progress and its history of catastrophic violence? The course follows the trajectory of Japan’s postwar nation-state development after the dissolution of empire, from its resurrection out of the ashes after defeat, to its identity as a US ally and economic superpower during the Cold War, to decades of recession since the 1990s and the search for new relations with its neighbors and new reckonings with its own imperial violence and postwar inactions against the background of rising neonationalism.\n",

We draw upon a diverse range of scholarship across the social sciences as well as history, architecture, and philosophy to better understand how we find ourselves in this present \"age of walls\" (Tim Marshall 2019). In addition, we take a comparative approach to the study of borders—examining specific contemporary and historical cases across the world in order to gain a comprehensive view of what borders are and how their meaning and function has changed over time. And because there is \"critical\" in the title, we explicitly evaluate the political consequences of borders, examine the sorts of resistances mobilized against them, and ask what alternative social and political worlds might be possible.\n",

      "ANTH 312 Feminist Science and Technology Studies. Natali Valdez. This seminar examines the production of scientific knowledge with an attention to race, gender, and power. It is guided by these key questions: who gets to produce knowledge? What counts as scientific knowledge? What kinds of power structures shape the production of science? How can Black, Indigenous, and postcolonial feminist approaches improve the production, application, and interpretation of science and technology? In the exploration of these questions, students are introduced to the interdisciplinary field of Feminist Science and Technology Studies (FSTS). The course is organized into three parts. Part I explores the history and theories of feminist science studies. From a history of science perspective students explore how modern science was and still is used to classify human difference across race and gender. Part II focuses on feminist examinations of biology, physics, and data science. Through the lens of feminist materialism, we explore topics including environmental politics, reproductive politics, and the relationship between science and capitalism. The final part of the course explores feminist science fiction and queer science writing to examine how science shapes social worlds and in turn how feminist and queer authors reimagine categories of race and gender through science.\n",

      "ANTH 324 Politics of Memory. Yukiko Koga. This course explores the role of memory as a social, cultural, and political force in contemporary society. How societies remember difficult pasts has become a contested site for negotiating the present. Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.\n",

      "ANTH 415 Culture, History, Power, and Representation. Helen Siu. This seminar critically explores how anthropologists use contemporary social theories to formulate the junctures of meaning, interest, and power. It thus aims to integrate symbolic, economic, and political perspectives on culture and social process. If culture refers to the understandings and meanings by which people live, then it constitutes the conventions of social life that are themselves produced in the flux of social life, invented by human activity. Theories of culture must therefore illuminate this problematic of agency and structure. They must show how social action can both reproduce and transform the structures of meaning, the conventions of social life. Even as such a position becomes orthodox in anthropology, it raises serious questions about the possibilities for ethnographic practice and theoretical analysis. How, for example, are such conventions generated and transformed where there are wide differentials of power and unequal access to resources? What becomes of our notions of humans as active agents of culture when the possibilities for maneuver and the margin of action for many are overwhelmed by the constraints of a few? How do elites—ritual elders, Brahmanic priests, manorial lords, factory-managers—secure compliance to a normative order? How are expressions of submission and resistance woven together in a fabric of cultural understandings? How does a theory of culture enhance our analyses of the reconstitution of political authority from traditional kingship to modern nation-state, the encapsulation of pre-capitalist modes of production, and the attempts to convert \"primordial sentiments\" to \"civic loyalties\"? How do transnational fluidities and diasporic connections make instruments of nation-states contingent? These questions are some of the questions we immediately face when probing the intersections of culture, politics and representation, and they are the issues that lie behind this seminar.\n",

      "ANTH 429 Primate Models for Human Evolution. David Watts. Comparison of nonhuman primates with hominins–modern humans and our extinct relatives on the human evolutionary lineage since our last common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos–is important for understanding how unique human traits evolved and also for understanding our biological and behavioral heritage as primates.  Much such work has involved using chimpanzees as \"referential models,\" but the chimpanzee model has been challenged in various ways, in part because of differences between chimpanzees and bonobos (who are equally closely related to humans). Other primates less-closely related to humans–notably baboons–have served as \"analogical\" models. In this course, we explore the value of such models for gaining insights into human evolutionary history and human behavior. Among the topics included are reconstruction of the diets and behavior of extinct hominins; hunting, meat eating, and meat sharing by nonhuman primates and the role of these behaviors in human evolution; tool making and tool use by nonhuman primates and by early hominins; intergroup aggression in chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans; the usefulness of the \"chimpanzee referential model;\" and comparative cognition of humans and great apes.\n",
      "ANTH 430 Muslims in the United States. Zareena Grewal. Since 9/11, cases of what has been termed \"home-grown terrorism\" have cemented the fear that \"bad\" Islam is not just something that exists far away, in distant lands. As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation. Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others. By focusing on a range of communities-in-motion and a diverse set of cultural texts, students explore the ways mobility, loss, and communal identity are conceptualized by immigrants, expatriates, refugees, guest-workers, religious seekers, and exiles. To this end, we read histories, ethnographies, essays, policy papers, novels, poetry, memoirs; we watch documentary and fictional films; we listen to music, speeches, spoken word performances, and prayers. Our aim is to deepen our understanding of the multiple meanings and conceptual limits of homeland and diaspora for Muslims in America, particularly in the Age of Terror.\n",

This advanced seminar examines the role that infrastructure plays in producing uneven geographies of power historically and in the \"colonial present\" (Gregory 2006). After defining terms and exploring the ways that infrastructure has been conceptualized and studied, we analyze how different types of infrastructure (energy, roads, people, and so on) constitute the material and social world of empire. At the same time, infrastructure is not an uncontested arena: it often serves as a key site of political struggle or even enters the fray as an unruly actor itself, thus conditioning possibilities for anti-imperial and decolonial practice. The geographic focus of this course is the African continent, but we explore comparative cases in other regions of the majority and minority world.\n",

      "ANTH 597 Power in Conservation. Carol Carpenter. This course examines the anthropology of power, particularly power in conservation interventions in the global South. It is intended to give students a toolbox of ideas about power in order to improve the effectiveness of conservation. Conservation thought and practice are power-laden: conservation thought is powerfully shaped by the history of ideas of nature and its relation to people, and conservation interventions govern and affect peoples and ecologies. This course argues that being able to think deeply, particularly about power, improves conservation policy making and practice. Political ecology is by far the best known and published approach to thinking about power in conservation; this course emphasizes the relatively neglected but robust anthropology of conservation literature outside political ecology, especially literature rooted in Foucault. It is intended to make four of Foucault’s concepts of power accessible, concepts that are the most used in the anthropology of conservation: the power of discourses, discipline and governmentality, subject formation, and neoliberal governmentality. The important ethnographic literature that these concepts have stimulated is also examined. Together, theory and ethnography can underpin our emerging understanding of a new, Anthropocene-shaped world. This course will be of interest to students and scholars of conservation, environmental anthropology, and political ecology, as well as conservation practitioners and policy makers. It is a required course for students in the combined YSE/Anthropology doctoral degree program. It is highly recommended for M.E.Sc. students who need an in-depth course on social science theory. M.E.M. students interested in conservation practice and policy making are also encouraged to consider this course, which makes an effort to bridge the gap between the best academic literature and practice.

      "ANTH 788 Origins of Ancient Egypt: Archaeology of the Neolithic, Predynastic, and Early Dynastic Periods. Gregory Marouard. This seminar is a graduate-level course that examines, from an archaeological and material culture perspective, the origins of the Egyptian civilization from the late Neolithic period (ca. 5500 BC) to the beginning of the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2900-2800 BC). After a progressive change of the Northeastern Africa climate in the course of the sixth millennium BC, the late Neolithic populations regroup within the Nile valley and rapidly settle in several parts of this natural corridor and major axis of communication between the African continent and the Middle East. Strongly influenced by the Saharan or the Levantine Neolithic, two early Egyptian sedentary communities will arise in Lower and Upper Egypt with very distinctive material cultures and burial practices, marking the gradual development of a complex society from which emerge important societal markers such as social differentiation, craft specialization, long-distance exchange networks, emergence of writing, administration and centralization, that will slowly lead to the development of local elites and early forms of kingship controlling proto-kingdoms. From those societies and the consecutive assimilation of both into a single cultural identity, around 3200 BC, some of the main characteristics of the subsequent Egyptian civilization will emerge from this crucial phase of state formation. Most of the major archaeological sites of this period are investigated through the scope of material culture; art; funerary traditions; and the study of large settlement and cemetery complexes using, as much as possible, information from recent excavations and discoveries. This course includes in particular the study of the first Neolithic settlements (Fayum, Merimde, al-Omari, Badari), the Lower Egyptian cultures (Buto, Maadi, Helwan and the Eastern Delta), the various phases of the Naqada cultures (at Hierakonpolis, Naqada and Ballas, Abydos), and the rise of the state (specifically in Abydos and Memphis areas). This course is suitable for graduate students (M.A. and Ph.D. programs) in the fields of Egyptology, archaeology, anthropology, and ancient history. With instructor and residential college dean approval, undergraduate students with a specialty in Egyptology or archaeology can register. No background in Egyptology is required, and no Egyptian language is taught. This course is the first in a series of chronological survey courses in Egyptian Archaeology.\n",

      "This course explores the role of memory as a social, cultural, and political force in contemporary society. How societies remember difficult pasts has become a contested site for negotiating the present. Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. The course explores the politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. It asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia, and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the United States, the course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.\n",

      "APHY 526 Explorations in Physics and Computation. Logan Wright. Computation has taken on an important, often central, role in both the practice and conception of physical science and engineering physics. This relationship is intricate and multifaceted, including computation for physics, computation with physics, and computation as a lens through which to understand physical processes. This course takes a more or less random walk within this space, surveying ideas and technologies that either apply computation to physics, that understand physical phenomena through the lens of computation, or that use physics to perform computation. Given the extent to which machine learning methods are currently revolutionizing this space of ideas, we focus somewhat more on topics related to modern machine learning, as opposed to other sorts of algorithms and computation. Since it is covered more deeply in other courses, we do not extensively cover error-corrected/fault tolerant quantum information processing, but we do frequently consider quantum physics. The course does not provide a systematic overview of any one topic, but rather a sampling of ideas and concepts relevant to modern research challenges. It is therefore intended for graduate students in early years of their program or research-inclined senior undergraduate students contemplating a research career. As a result, in addition to the scientific topics at hand, key learning goals include the basics of literature review, presentation, collegial criticism (peer review), and synthesizing new research ideas. Evaluation is primarily through two projects, one a lecture reviewing a topic area of interest and one a tutorial notebook providing worked numerical examples/code meant to develop or introduce a concept.\n",

The course is meant to be in the orthogonal complement of traditional courses working through Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics—we (mostly) avoid specialized high-symmetry cases in which Maxwell’s equations can be solved exactly. Instead, our emphasis is on general mode, quasinormal-mode, and scattering-matrix descriptions, as well as surface- and volume-integral formulations that distill the essential physics of complex systems. The unique properties and trade-offs for a variety of computational methods, including finite-element, finite-difference, integral-equation, and modal-expansion (e.g., RCWA) approaches, comprise a significant portion of the latter half of the term.

      "ARCG 788 Origins of Ancient Egypt: Archaeology of the Neolithic, Predynastic, and Early Dynastic Periods. Gregory Marouard. This seminar is a graduate-level course that examines, from an archaeological and material culture perspective, the origins of the Egyptian civilization from the late Neolithic period (ca. 5500 BC) to the beginning of the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2900-2800 BC). After a progressive change of the Northeastern Africa climate in the course of the sixth millennium BC, the late Neolithic populations regroup within the Nile valley and rapidly settle in several parts of this natural corridor and major axis of communication between the African continent and the Middle East. Strongly influenced by the Saharan or the Levantine Neolithic, two early Egyptian sedentary communities will arise in Lower and Upper Egypt with very distinctive material cultures and burial practices, marking the gradual development of a complex society from which emerge important societal markers such as social differentiation, craft specialization, long-distance exchange networks, emergence of writing, administration and centralization, that will slowly lead to the development of local elites and early forms of kingship controlling proto-kingdoms. From those societies and the consecutive assimilation of both into a single cultural identity, around 3200 BC, some of the main characteristics of the subsequent Egyptian civilization will emerge from this crucial phase of state formation. Most of the major archaeological sites of this period are investigated through the scope of material culture; art; funerary traditions; and the study of large settlement and cemetery complexes using, as much as possible, information from recent excavations and discoveries. This course includes in particular the study of the first Neolithic settlements (Fayum, Merimde, al-Omari, Badari), the Lower Egyptian cultures (Buto, Maadi, Helwan and the Eastern Delta), the various phases of the Naqada cultures (at Hierakonpolis, Naqada and Ballas, Abydos), and the rise of the state (specifically in Abydos and Memphis areas). This course is suitable for graduate students (M.A. and Ph.D. programs) in the fields of Egyptology, archaeology, anthropology, and ancient history. With instructor and residential college dean approval, undergraduate students with a specialty in Egyptology or archaeology can register. No background in Egyptology is required, and no Egyptian language is taught. This course is the first in a series of chronological survey courses in Egyptian Archaeology.\n",

      "ARCH 006 Architectures of Urbanism: Thinking, Seeing, Writing the Just City. Michael Schlabs. What is architecture, and how is it conceived, relative to notions of the urban – to the broader, deeper, messier web of ideas, forms, and fantasies constituting \"the city?\" Can architecture play a role in defining the city, as such, or does the city’s political and social construction place it outside the scope of specifically architectural concerns? Likewise, what role can the city play in establishing, interrogating, and extrapolating the limits of architecture, whether as a practice, a discourse, or a physical manifestation of human endeavor in the material environment? This course addresses these and other, related questions, seeking to position art and architecture in their broader urban, social, cultural, political, intellectual, and aesthetic contexts. It explores issues of social justice as they relate to the material spaces of the modern city, and the manner in which those spaces are identified, codified, and made operative in service of aesthetic, social, and political experience.

With the emergence of increasingly sophisticated digital technologies, the practice of architecture is undergoing the most comprehensive transformation in centuries. Drawing, historically the primary means of generation, presentation, and interrogation of design ideas, is currently ill-defined and under stress. This course examines the historical and theoretical development of descriptive geometry and perspective through the practice of rigorous constructed architectural drawings. The methods and concepts studied serve as a foundation for the development of drawings that consider the relationship between a drawing’s production and its conceptual objectives. Weekly readings, discussions, and drawing exercises investigate the work of key figures in the development of orthographic and three-dimensional projection. Ultimately, the goal is to engage in a focused dialogue about the practice of drawing and different methods of spatial inquiry. Limited enrollment.\n",
      "ARCH 1228 Ruins, Ruination and Reuse. Mark Gage. Architectural ruins index the total failure of individual buildings, technologies, economies, or, at times, entire civilizations. This course researches the topics of ruination and architectural ruins—what produces them, what defines them, and how they impact individuals, cities, and civilizations on levels from the visual and formal to the philosophical and psychological. The formal and visual materials of this course emerge from the study of ruins from not only the past and present, but also the future, through research into the speculative territories of online \"ruin porn,\" new genres of art practice, and in particular dystopian television and film projects that reveal an intense contemporary cultural interest in apocalyptic themes. While significant nineteenth-century theories of architectural ruination, including those of John Ruskin (anti-restoration) and Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (pro-restoration), are addressed, the primary intellectual position of the course emerges from readings and discussions of the philosophical methodology of \"ruination.\" Student projects involve the philosophical and aesthetic ruination of iconic architectural projects to determine not only their essential qualities, but hidden, latent ones as well. Subsequent group discussion of this work vacillates between philosophical and aesthetic poles in an attempt to tease out new observations on these projects as well as on the nature of ruins and ruination. The self-designed final project is determined pending consultation between the students and instructor, but involves photorealistic failure of past, present, or future architectural or urban projects; dystopic visual speculations; fabrication experiments that test actual material decay and failure; or attempts to reproduce the aesthetic ambitions of ruin porn through the manipulation of existing, or the design of new, projects. The goal of the course is not to convey an existing body of architectural knowledge, but to unearth a new architectural discourse that considers architecture in reverse—emphasizing its decay rather than its creation in an effort to reveal new territories of architectural agency. Limited enrollment.\n",
      "ARCH 1233 Composition and Form. Peter de Bretteville. This seminar addresses issues of architectural composition and form in four three-week exercises titled Form, Structure, Section, and Elevation. Leaving aside demands of program and site in order to concentrate on formal relationships and the impact of alternative strategies, these exercises are intended to develop techniques by which words, briefs, written descriptions, intentions, and requirements can be translated into three dimensions. Each subject is introduced by a one-hour lecture on organizational paradigms in works of architecture from many periods and a variety of cultures. The medium is both physical and 3-D digital models. Multiple iterations emerging from the first-week sketches and finalized in the following week are the basis for the generation of multiple, radically differing strategies, each to be analyzed and understood for its own unique possibilities and consequences. Limited enrollment.\n",
      "ARCH 1248 Cartographies of Climate Change. Joyce Hsiang. Climate change disproportionately affects the people and places with the least power and resources. As our sea levels have risen, so too has the extreme socioeconomic disparity of specific communities and countries, creating a drowning class of climate refugees. Entire countries on the front lines of sea-level rise face the specter of nationhood without territory, despite the undeniable fact that their contribution to this global problem is negligible. And if climate change is in fact \"the result of human activity since the mid-20th century,\" it is in actuality a largely male-made phenomenon, if we unpack the gender dynamics and underlying power structures of the proto-G8 nations, the self-proclaimed leaders of industrialization. These power dynamics become even further exacerbated as we consider the implications of the particularly American interest in doubling down on investing in the heaviest piece of infrastructure ever—climate engineering. The architectural community appears to be in agreement. Climate change is a fundamental design problem. And yet calls to action have been ineffectual, responses underwhelming in the face of this overwhelming challenge. As the architectural community is eagerly poised to jump on the design bandwagon, this course seeks to reveal, foreground, empower, and give physical form to the spatial dimensions and power dynamics of the people and places most impacted by climate change. More broadly, the course aspires to help students develop their own critical stance on climate change and the role architects play.\n",
      "ARCH 1249 Virtual Futures. Jason Kim, Olalekan Jeyifous. This course is an investigation of the ways technology, which now mediates data through spatial computing platforms such as extended reality (XR), will continue to impact our relationship with the built environment and the architect’s role in the development of these new digital horizons. Our exploration in XR includes a special guest instructor, Olalekan Jeyifous, a visual artist whose work explores visions of the future as a critique of contemporary social structures though the creation of dystopian realities describing urban issues, politics, art, and popular culture as expressions of the black diaspora within the disappearing urban ephemera of places like Brooklyn, New York, where his practice is based. Together, we explore the existing urban condition as an environment co-constitutive of other realities such as social structures, institutionalized injustice, and prevailing false narratives expressed as imagined futures in the form of non-static immersive experiences of the city. These imagined futures reveal the thin line between hope and despair as expressions of uncomfortable truths about the current trajectories of society.\n",
      "ARCH 1250 The Plan. Brennan Buck. The architectural plan is an index of architectural values—of how buildings configure people in relation to each other. Historically, the plan was the means through which architects deployed principles of proportion, composition, uniformity, montage, and figuration. It expresses the underlying ethics and ideologies of the architecture; evidences the background environment of building technologies, rules, regulations, conventions, and customs; and traces the power relations that buildings enact. The recent return of the plan as a topic of discourse and focus of architectural energy suggests renewed interest in the correlation of form and politics that the plan describes. This course sketches the history of plan making in the west during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from Beaux Arts composition to modern \"non-composition,\" before focusing on the scattershot discourse about the plan today. Rather than positing a single grand thesis about the contemporary plan, the course foregrounds the countless threads of plan making evident today and asks students to identify the underlying ideas, histories, and implications of specific plans.\n",

      "ARCH 2021 Environmental Design. Mae-Ling Lokko. (Required of second-year M.Arch. I students.) This course examines the fundamental scientific principles governing the thermal, luminous, and acoustic environments of buildings, and introduces students to the methods and technologies for creating and controlling the interior environment. Beginning with an overview of the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of heat transfer, the course investigates the application of these principles in the determination of building behavior, and explores the design variables, including climate, for mitigating that behavior. The basic characteristics of HVAC systems are discussed, as are alternative systems such as natural ventilation. The second half of the term draws on the basic laws of physics for optics and sound and examines the application of these laws in creating the visual and auditory environments of a building. Material properties are explored in detail, and students are exposed to the various technologies for producing and controlling light, from daylighting to fiber optics. The overarching premise of the course is that the understanding and application of the physical principles by the architect must respond to and address the larger issues surrounding energy and the environment at multiple scales and in domains beyond a single building. The course is presented in a lecture format. Homework, computational labs, design projects, short quizzes, and a final exam are required.\n",
      "ARCH 2031 Architectural Practice and Management. Cristian Oncescu, Dov Feinmesser, Heather Kim, Melinda Agron, Paolo Campos, Susana La Porta Drago. (Required of third-year M.Arch. I students. No waivers allowed. Available as an elective for M.Arch. II students who obtain permission of the instructor.) The process by which an architectural design becomes a building requires the architect to control many variables beyond the purely aesthetic, and understanding how to control that process is key to successful practice. This course provides an understanding of the fundamentals of the structure and organization of the profession and the mechanisms and systems within which it works as well as the organization, management, and execution of architectural projects. Lectures explore the role and function of the architect, the legal environment, models of practice and office operations, fees and compensation, project delivery models and technology, and project management in the context of the evolution of architectural practice in the delivery of buildings.\n",
      "ARCH 2222 The Mechanical Eye. Dana Karwas. This course examines the human relationship to mechanized perception in art and architecture. Mechanical eyes, such as satellites, rovers, computer vision, and autonomous sensing devices, give us unprecedented access to nonhuman and superhuman views into known and unknown environments. But the technology of automatic observation alienates human observers and fools them into thinking that this is an unemotional, inhuman point of view due to its existence in a numeric or digital domain. The observer is looking at seemingly trustworthy data that has been \"flattened\" or distilled from the real world. But this face-value acceptance should be rejected; interpreters of this device data should interrogate the motives, biases, or perspectives informing the \"artist\" in this case (that is, the developer/programmer/engineer who created the devices). Despite the displacement of direct human observation, mechanical eyes present in remote sensing, LiDAR scanning, trail-cams, metagenomic sequencing, urban informatics, and hyperspectral imaging have become fundamental to spatial analysis. But as these become standard practice, observers should also be trained in cracking open the data to understand the human perspective that originally informed it. In this class, students investigate the impact of the mechanical eye on cultural and aesthetic inquiry into a specific site. They conceptually consider their role as interpreter for the machine and create a series of site analysis experiments across a range of mediums. The experiments are based on themes of inversion, mirroring, portraiture, memory, calibration, and foregrounding to \"unflatten\" data into structure and form. Limited enrollment.\n",

      "ARCH 306 Ornamenting Architecture: Cosmos, Nature, Neuroaesthetics. Kassandra Semenov-Leiva, Misha Semenov-Leiva. From foliated friezes to snaking spirals, gruesome gargoyles to graceful guilloches, humans have used ornament for millennia to adorn objects and buildings. What is the function of ornament in the built environment? How does it mediate between the objects it adorns, the viewers it addresses, and the cosmos? What role does it play in orchestrating building occupants’ sense of space, order, and time? And is there scientific evidence for any of these claims? This course provides a venue for exploring these questions through hands-on design and analysis while finding empirical grounding in the emerging fields of biophilic design and neuroaesthetics. Design exercises introduce students to symmetry operations, tessellation, repeat patterns, and foliation, giving the class a basic fluency in the language of ornament. As we study historic precedents and the fundamental geometric properties of ornament, we simultaneously research how these patterns are perceived by the brain, both in the scientific literature and through the use of our own eye trackers and EEG sensors. Students are led through a series of design exercises of increasing complexity in both two and three dimensions, culminating in an ornament project for a shared site. This seminar is meant to nurture methodologies of design that fuse a grounding in the history of ornament with the application of cutting edge technology, enabling novel forms of empirically-grounded design.\n",

      "ARCH 3108 Domo Ludens: Modern Art and Architecture at Play. Michael Schlabs. The notion of play occupies a special place in the history of modern art and architecture. Theorized in the 19th century by Friedrich Froebel as fundamental to the process by which children learn, play would form the basis of Froebel’s kindergarten, now a model for early childhood education worldwide. The aesthetic intensity of Froebel’s program would likewise contribute to a variety of radical educational projects in the 19th and 20th centuries, including the Bauhaus. Later, Johan Huizinga’s seminal meditation on the \"play element in culture,\" Homo Ludens, would provide an intellectual foundation for a number of 20th century aesthetic and political movements, among them the Situationist International. Finally, a generous focus on play has recently reemerged within the discourse on a range of 21st century art and design practices, characterized by a shared focus on participation and performativity, as in the work of Rirkrit Tiravanija and Lottie Child. This course, then, explores the place and problem of play in three ways: as a critical framework for understanding the aesthetic qualities of the human environment; as a mode of experience, giving meaning to that environment; and as a working method employed by artists and architects as a specific form of practice.\n",

To revamp semiotics’ main tasks, after an introduction about the idea of \"making meaning,\" the seminar engages students in a weekly discussion about situations, procedures, objects, and attributes that are \"meaningful,\" in the double sense that they have meaning and they arrange reality in a meaningful way. Objects of analysis are intentionally disparate; the constant application of a set of analytical tools provides the coherence of the seminar.

      "ARCH 327 Difference and the City. Justin Moore. Four hundred and odd years after colonialism and racial capitalism brought twenty and odd people from Africa to the dispossessed indigenous land that would become the United States, the structures and systems that generate inequality and white supremacy persist. Our cities and their socioeconomic and built environments continue to exemplify difference. From housing and health to mobility and monuments, cities small and large, north and south, continue to demonstrate intractable disparities. The disparate impacts made apparent by the COVID-19 pandemic and the reinvigorated and global Black Lives Matter movement demanding change are remarkable. Change, of course, is another essential indicator of difference in urban environments, exemplified by the phenomena of disinvestment or gentrification.

      "ARCH 3301 Four Urban Thinkers and Their Visions for New York City: Mumford, Moses, Jacobs, Koolhaas. Joan Ockman. The seminar is constructed as a debate among the ideas of four urban thinkers whose influential contributions to the discourse of the modern city were shaped by their divergent responses to New York City’s urban and architectural development: Lewis Mumford (1895–1990), Robert Moses (1888–1981), Jane Jacobs (1916–2006), and Rem Koolhaas (1944–). In counterposing their respective arguments, the seminar addresses issues of civic representation and environmentalism, infrastructure development and urban renewal policy, community and complexity, and the role of architecture in the urban imaginary. The focus is twofold: on the contribution of the \"urban intellectual\" to the making of culture; and on New York’s architectural and urban history. New York has been called the capital of the twentieth century. By reassessing the legacy and agency of these visionary thinkers, the seminar not only reflects on New York’s evolution over the course of the last century but raises questions about the future of cities in the twenty-first century. A selection of historical and theoretical material complements seminal readings by the four protagonists. Each student is responsible for making two case-study presentations and producing a thematically related term paper. Limited enrollment.\n",
      "ARCH 3303 Urban Century Theorizing Global Urbanism. Vyjayanthi Rao. From the beginning of the twentieth century to the present, urbanization has gradually come to dominate political, economic, social, and cultural landscapes of the contemporary world. To be urban was to be modern, and the development of modern social theory relied on using the city as its research laboratory. Two decades into the twenty-first century, features of urbanization such as density, resource extraction, environmental degradation, and intense social inequalities appear to be ubiquitous across different geopolitical conditions. This course presents students with a range of theories that attempt to make sense of the variegated and intersecting conditions that define contemporary urban localities. Building on the understanding offered by these theories, we conclude with an exploration of emerging positions, concepts, and propositions that enable new ways of understanding the centrality of urbanism within a world dominated by uncertainty, speculation, and dystopia.\n",

From plant fibers to peat particles, cellulose to lignin, fungi to carbon-neutral concrete–  the use of a broad renewable material ecology from the field is becoming the feedstock of the 21st century materials revolution. On the one hand, the design of such renewable material streams are framed within today’s carbon framework as ‘substitutes’ within a hydrocarbon material economy and on the other, such materials are proposed in direct resistance to these very systems, as ‘alternatives’ to such ‘development’. The seminar explores the spectrum of biobased design histories and pathways within Arturo Escobar’s pluriversal framework. From the North Atlantic Scottish blackhouses, equatorial Tongkonan to the wetland ecologies of the Totora, the course begins with an exploration of field materials through vernacular architecture and agricultural practices. The second part of the course explores the relative levels of displacement of field materials from today’s material economies in response to empire–both botanical and industrial. Finally, students investigate continuation of local narratives alongside the relocalization of global narratives of three materials–timber, biomass and fungi-based building material systems.\n",

The course examines chronologically the evolution of several key elements in landscape design: architectural and garden typologies; the boundaries between inside and outside; issues of topography and geography; various uses of water; organization of plant materials; and matters of garden decoration, including sculptural tropes. Specific gardens or representations of landscape in each of the four periods under discussion—Ancient Roman, medieval, early and late Renaissance, and Baroque—are examined and situated within their own cultural context. Throughout the seminar, comparisons of historical material with contemporary landscape design are emphasized. Limited enrollment.\n",
      "ARCH 4247 Difference and the City. Justin Moore. Four hundred and odd years after colonialism and racial capitalism brought twenty and odd people from Africa to the dispossessed indigenous land that would become the United States, the structures and systems that generate inequality and white supremacy persist. Our cities and their socioeconomic and built environments continue to exemplify difference. From housing and health to mobility and monuments, cities small and large, north and south, continue to demonstrate intractable disparities. The disparate impacts made apparent by the COVID-19 pandemic and the reinvigorated and global Black Lives Matter movement demanding change are remarkable. Change, of course, is another essential indicator of difference in urban environments, exemplified by the phenomena of disinvestment or gentrification. This course explores how issues like climate change and growing income inequality intersect with politics, culture, gender equality, immigration and migration, technology, and other considerations and forms of disruption.\n",

      "ARCH 551 Ph.D. Seminar: History/Theory I: Architecture & Geography. Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen. The course centered around the question relevant to architectural scholars and practicing architects alike: how to make sense of architecture’s relationship to a particular locale and how to define the factors and actors that define that define that locale and its scope. We will interrogate how different geographic ideas, concepts, and imagery has been used to discuss both natural and cultural phenomena in scholarship and design; how surveys and cartography have been deployed by different actors; and what different material practices teach us about architecture’s geographic footprint. The seminar is organized around different geographic concepts. We will conduct a historiographic overview of geographic ideas such as place and region; interrogate geopolitical subtexts behind national and international architectures; consider the impact of various forms of transnational exchange within the history of architecture and urbanism; and explore the usefulness of new geographic markers like Global South and Global North in highlighting economic disparities. Throughout the semester pay attention to how various geographic narratives have been represented architecturally and disseminated through various media from exhibitions to photography and film. Readings are selected with the transdisciplinary nature of the field in mind. We will read canonical architectural texts by Kenneth Frampton, Barbara Miller Lane, and Christian Norbert-Schultz, who have all used geographic concepts and markers in their writings. In addition, we will study foundational texts by 20th century historians, political scientists, and geographers, such as Benedikt Anderson, Arjun Appadurai, Fernand Braudel, Denis Cosgrove, Lucien Fevbre, Henri Lefebvre, and Paul Ricoeur, and learn from radical geographers, such as Guy Debord, David Harvey, and Doreen Massey, who, starting in the 1950s and 1960s, began to study geography from the perspective of civil rights, colonialism, environmental pollution, social inequality, and war. The course is required for first- and second-year PhD students at YSOA and welcomes PhD students from other departments.

We simultaneously explore the work of others and each student's own development as a graphic designer. Additionally, several field trips are organized to visit design studios and other places of design production and research to encounter and assess various methods of generating work in the context of visual communication. In the spring term, a few self-initiated projects are added to the aforementioned to formally and physically explore some of the content investigated during the fall.\n",
      "ART 720 First-Year Graduate Studio: Graphic Design. Andrew Walsh-Lister, Nontsikelelo Mutiti. For students entering the two-year program. The first-year core studio is composed of a number of intense workshops taught by resident and visiting faculty. These core workshops grow from a common foundation, each assignment asking the student to reconsider text, space, or object. We encourage the search for connections and relationships between the projects. Rather than seeing courses as being discreet, our faculty teaching other term-long classes expect to be shown work done in the core studio. Over the course of the term, the resident core studio faculty help students identify nascent interests and possible thesis areas.\n",
      "ART 730 Second-Year Graduate Studio: Graphic Design. Dan Michaelson, Manuel Miranda, Yeju Choi. For second-year graduate students.

The independent project or \"thesis\" is expected to represent a significant body of work accomplished over the course of two years, culminating in the design of an exhibition of the work.\n",
      "ART 742 On Gatherings: Collections and Lecture Performances. Melinda Seu. This is a studio-seminar course about two forms of gatherings: collections and lecture performances. In the first half of the term, we focus on \"material gathering\" through an emphasis on readings and critical examination of archival theory. This portion also includes a field trip to an archival site as well as the creation of a collection of the student's choosing. In reference to Ursula K. Le Guin’s \"Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,\" we position the first tool as the basket, a tool for communion, rather than the spear, a tool for domination. In doing so, we question the curatorial and political role of the collector, as well as the form of the container of these collections. The second half of the term segues towards \"social gatherings,\" an experimental site of research-based lecture performances and thought theater. As questioned by Gordon Hall, \"What happens when public speaking becomes artwork?\" We read and discuss an abbreviated history of the lecture performance, analyze its wide-ranging forms, and participate in a workshop by Yale Drama. The term culminates with an afternoon of lecture performances, organized and executed by those in the course. This course prioritizes acceptance of second-year Graphic Design students.\n",
      "ART 744 Moving Image Methods. Neil Goldberg. This class explores the signature formal properties and possibilities of video and provides critical frameworks for understanding moving image work. A series of hands-on projects introduces video production techniques, with a focus on accessible approaches over technically complex ones. Screenings from various cinema and video art traditions provide context for these explorations and help guide critique of the students’ own work. One thematic focus is on framing the everyday, the overlooked, and the incidental, providing a useful bridge to some of the key concerns of graphic design practice: how to direct attention, create emphasis, make manifest the latent and the liminal. In addition to production strategies, the course offers exercises that focus attention on the act of attention itself, to investigate how video can augment and transfigure the act of observation and uniquely represent what is observed. These exercises build toward the completion of a larger video project incorporating the approaches introduced throughout the term. Students gain the technical and critical facility to incorporate moving image work thoughtfully in their own design practices.\n",
      "ART 750 Coded Design. Bryant Wells. Learning how to apply the medium of the Internet to the practice of design. Through discourse, example, and collaboration, we learn how the shape and properties of information influence the digital surfaces around us.

      "BIS 537 Statistical Methods for Causal Inference. Fan Li. This course formally introduces statistical theory and methods that allow rigorous comparisons of treatment strategies for public health and biomedical studies. Although randomization is the gold standard for unbiased treatment comparisons, observational studies are increasingly common for comparative effectiveness research for real-world evidence (RWE). The course addresses complexities in the design and analysis of observational studies for the purpose of comparing treatments. We focus on the treatment effect averaged over a target population as the parameter of scientific interest, and we discuss conditions when the parameter can be interpreted as causal. Modern statistical tools for inferring causality are developed and demonstrated. In the first half of the course, we formalize the comparison of a point treatment in cross-sectional observational studies; and we develop regression, propensity score subclassification, matching, weighting, and hybrid estimators. In the second half, we turn to the more complex time-varying treatments in longitudinal observational studies and introduce methods to account for time-dependent confounding and censoring bias. We explain why traditional regression adjustment fails and discuss the methods of g-computation, sequential stratification, marginal structural models, and structural nested models. Examples are drawn from various biomedical and health-related studies.\n",

      "C&MP 610 Medical Research Scholars Program: Mentored Clinical Experience. George Lister, Richard Pierce, Yelizaveta Konnikova. The purpose of the Mentored Clinical Experience (MCE), an MRSP-specific course, is to permit students to gain a deep understanding of and appreciation for the interface between basic biomedical research and its application to clinical practice. The MCE is intended to integrate basic and translational research with direct exposure to clinical medicine and patients afflicted with the diseases or conditions under discussion. The course provides a foundation and a critically important forum for class discussion because each module stimulates students to explore a disease process in depth over four ninety-minute sessions led by expert clinician-scientists. The structure incorporates four perspectives to introduce the students to a particular disease or condition and then encourages them to probe areas that are not understood or fully resolved so they can appreciate the value and challenge inherent in using basic science to enhance clinical medicine. Students are provided biomedical resource material for background to the sessions as well as articles or other publicly available information that offers insight to the perspective from the non-scientific world. During this course students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Students are expected to prepare for sessions, to participate actively, and to be scrupulously respectful of patients and patient facilities. Prior to one of the sessions students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the students discuss their thoughts and impressions. All students receive HIPAA training and appropriate training in infection control and decorum relating to patient contact prior to the course.\n",

      "CHLD 125 Child Development. Ann Close, Carla Horwitz. This course is first in a sequence including Theory and Practice of Early Childhood Education (CHLD127/PSYCH 127/EDST 127) and Language Literacy and Play (CHLD 128/PSYCH 128/EDST 128). This course provides students a theoretical base in child development and behavior and tools to sensitively and carefully observer infants and young children. The seminar will consider aspects of cognitive, social, and emotional development. An assumption of this course is that it is not possible to understand children – their behavior and development—without understanding their families and culture and the relationships between children and parents. The course will give an overview of the major theories in the field, focusing on the complex interaction between the developing self and the environment, exploring current research and theory as well as practice. Students will have the opportunity to see how programs for young children use psychodynamic and interactional theories to inform the development of their philosophy and curriculum. Weekly Observations:-Total Time Commitment 3 hours per week. Students will do two separate weekly observations over the course of the semester. They will observe in a group setting for 2 hours each each week at a Yale affiliated child care center.  Students will also arrange to do a weekly 1 hour observation (either in person or virtually) of a child under the age of 6. Students must make their own arrangements for these individual observations. If it is not possible to arrange a child to observe, please do not apply to take this course. For a portion of class meetings, the class will divide into small supervisory discussion groups.\n",
      "CHLD 228 Contemporary Topics in Social and Emotional Learning. Christina Cipriano. While our nation's youth are increasingly more anxious and disconnected than ever before, social and emotional learning, or SEL, is being politicized by arguments without empirical evidence. The reality is that due in part to its interdisciplinary origins, and in part to its quick uptake, what SEL is, why it matters, and who it benefits, has garnered significant attention since its inception. Key questions and discourse over the past three decades include if SEL skills are: another name for personality, soft skills, 21st century skills, or emotional intelligence, are SEL skills stand-alone or do they need to be taught together and in sequence, for how long does the intervention need to last to be effective, how do you assess SEL, are SEL skills culturally responsive and universally applicable, and can SEL promote the conditions for education equity? In this seminar, students unpack these key questions and challenge and evolve the current discourse through seminal and contemporary readings, writing, and artifact analyses. Students are provided with the opportunity to engage critically with the largest data set amassed to date of the contemporary evidence for SEL.\n",

      "CLCV 377 Tragedy and Politics. Daniel Schillinger. The canonical Greek tragedians—Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides—dramatize fundamental and discomfiting questions that are often sidelined by the philosophical tradition. In this seminar, we read plays about death, war, revenge, madness, impossible choices, calamitous errors, and the destruction of whole peoples. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were also piercing observers of political life. No less than Plato and Aristotle, the Attic tragedians write to elicit reflection on the basic patterns of politics: democracy and tyranny, war and peace, the family and the city, the rule of law and violence. Finally, we also approach Greek tragedy through its reception. Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Nietzsche: all these thinkers responded to tragedy. Texts include Aeschylus, Oresteia; Aristophanes, Frogs and Lysistrata; Euripides, Bacchae, Heracles, and Trojan Women; Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy; Plato, Symposium; and Sophocles, Antigone, Philoctetes, and Oedipus Tyrannus.\n",

      "CPLT 510 The Mortality of the Soul: From Aristotle to Heidegger. Martin Hagglund. This course explores fundamental philosophical questions of the relation between matter and form, life and spirit, necessity and freedom, by proceeding from Aristotle’s analysis of the soul in De Anima and his notion of practical agency in the Nicomachean Ethics. We study Aristotle in conjunction with seminal works by contemporary neo-Aristotelian philosophers (Korsgaard, Nussbaum, Brague, and McDowell). We in turn pursue the implications of Aristotle’s notion of life by engaging with contemporary philosophical discussions of death that take their point of departure in Epicurus (Nagel, Williams, Scheffler). We conclude by analyzing Heidegger’s notion of constitutive mortality, in order to make explicit what is implicit in the form of the soul in Aristotle.\n",
      "CPLT 547 Zählen und Erzählen: On the Relation Between Mathematics and Literature. Anja Lemke. Mathematical and literary practices of signs have numerous connections, and despite current debates on digital humanities, algorithm and the \"end of the book\", the relation between calculus and writing can be traced back to around 3000 BC, when the graphé was split up into figure and character. The seminar explores this relationship by focusing on four different fields, which can be discussed separately but do exhibit numerous overlappings: a) Leibniz’ invention of infinitesimal calculus and its relation to the idea of narration from the Baroque to romanticism through to the twentieth century novel, (b) the relation between probability calculus, statistics, and novel writing in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, (c) the role of cypher for aesthetic and poetic questions starting with Schiller’s Letters on the esthetic education of men, to Robert Walser’s Jakob von Gunten, and Jenny Erpenpeck’s The old child, and (d) the economic impact of computation on poetic concepts, e.g. the role of double entry bookkeeping or models of circulation in romantic theories of money and signs. We discuss Leibniz’ Theodizee, texts on the infinitesimal calculus and his concept of an ars combinatoria, novels like The Fortunatus, Novalis’s Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Stifter’s \"The gentle law\", Gustav Freiytag’s Debit and Credit, and Musil’s Man without content, Novalis’s notes on mathematical questions of his time, and economic texts such as Adam Müller’s Attempt on a theory of money.\n",
      "CPLT 549 Memory and Memoir in Russian Culture. Jinyi Chu. How do we remember and forget? How does memory transform into narrative? Why do we read and write memoirs and autobiography? What can they tell us about the past? How do we analyze the roles of the narrator, the author, and the protagonist? How should we understand the ideological tensions between official historiography and personal reminiscences, especially in twentieth-century Russia? This course aims to answer these questions through close readings of a few cultural celebrities’ memoirs and autobiographical writings that are also widely acknowledged as the best representatives of twentieth-century Russian prose. Along the way, we read literary texts in dialogue with theories of memory, historiography, and narratology. Students acquire the theoretical apparatus that will enable them to analyze the complex ideas, e.g., cultural memory and trauma, historicity and narrativity, and fiction and nonfiction. Students acquire an in-depth knowledge of the major themes of twentieth-century Russian history—e.g., empire, revolution, war, Stalinism, and exilic experience—as well as increased skills in the analysis of literary texts. Students with knowledge of Russian are encouraged to read in the original. All readings are available in English.\n",
      "CPLT 555 Postcolonial Middle Ages. Marcel Elias. This course explores the intersections and points of friction between postcolonial studies and medieval studies. We discuss key debates in postcolonialism and medievalists’ contributions to those debates. We also consider postcolonial scholarship that has remained outside the purview of medieval studies. The overall aim is for students, in their written and oral contributions, to expand the parameters of medieval postcolonialism. Works by critics including Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, Leela Gandhi, Lisa Lowe, Robert Young, and Priyamvada Gopal are read alongside medieval romances, crusade and jihād poetry, travel literature, and chronicles.\n",
      "CPLT 606 Introduction to Digital Humanities I: Architectures of Knowledge. Alexander Gil Fuentes. The cultural record of humanity is undergoing a massive and epochal transformation into shared analog and digital realities. While we are vaguely familiar with the history and realities of the analog record—libraries, archives, historical artifacts—the digital cultural record remains largely unexamined and relatively mysterious to humanities scholars. In this course students are introduced to the broad field of digital humanities, theory and practice, through a stepwise exploration of the new architectures and genres of scholarly and humanistic production and reproduction in the twenty-first century. The course combines a seminar, preceded by a brief lecture, and a digital studio. Every week we move through our discussions in tandem with hands-on exercises that serve to illuminate our readings and help students gain a measure of computational proficiency useful in humanities scholarship. Students learn about the basics of plain text, file and operating systems, data structures and internet infrastructure. Students also learn to understand, produce, and evaluate a few popular genres of digital humanities, including, digital editions of literary or historical texts, collections and exhibits of primary sources and interactive maps. Finally, and perhaps the most important lesson of the term, students learn to collaborate with each other on a common research project. No prior experience is required.\n",
      "CPLT 610 Theories of Freedom: Schelling and Hegel. Paul North. In 1764 Immanuel Kant noted in the margin of one of his published books that evil was \"the subjection of one being under the will of another,\" a sign that good was coming to mean freedom. But what is freedom? Starting with early reference to Kant, we study two major texts on freedom in post-Kantian German Idealism, Schelling's 1809 Philosophical Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom and Related Objects and Hegel's 1820 Elements of the Philosophy of Right.\n",
      "CPLT 612 Socialist '80s: Aesthetics of Reform in China and the Soviet Union. Jinyi Chu. This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of the complex cultural and political paradigms of late socialism from a transnational perspective by focusing on the literature, cinema, and popular culture of the Soviet Union and China in 1980s. How were intellectual and everyday life in the Soviet Union and China distinct from and similar to that of the West of the same era? How do we parse \"the cultural logic of late socialism?\" What can today’s America learn from it? Examining two major socialist cultures together in a global context, this course queries the ethnographic, ideological, and socio-economic constituents of late socialism. Students analyze cultural materials in the context of Soviet and Chinese history. Along the way, we explore themes of identity, nationalism, globalization, capitalism, and the Cold War. Students with knowledge of Russian and Chinese are encouraged to read in original. All readings are available in English.\n",

      "CPLT 632 Literature and Film of World War II: Homefront Narratives. Katie Trumpener. Taking a pan-European perspective, this course examines quotidian, civilian experiences of war, during a conflict of unusual scope and duration. Considering key works of wartime and postwar fiction and film alongside verbal and visual diaries, memoirs, documentaries, and video testimonies, we will explore the kinds of literary and filmic reflection war occasioned, how civilians experienced the relationship between history and everyday life (both during and after the war), women’s and children's experience of war, and the ways that home front, occupation and Holocaust memories shaped postwar avant-garde aesthetics.\n",
      "CPLT 644 The Betrayal of the Intellectuals. Hannan Hever. The target of the seminar is to clarify the concept of the intellectual and its political and literary uses during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The point of departure is Julien Benda’s influential book, The Betrayal of the Intellectuals (1927). Benda defines two kinds of intellectuals: the particularists, who are specifically committed to country, party, and economic issues—later thought of as the arena of \"identity politics\"—and the universalists, committed to more general humanist values. What makes one an intellectual? Does becoming an intellectual depend on specific historical, social, cultural, literary, and political conditions? Is being an intellectual a matter of \"talking truth to power\" in accordance with universalist values? The course looks at a variety of definitions of what constitutes an intellectual, based on approaches such as Benda’s notion of the betrayal of the particularist intellectual, or postcolonial intellectualism. The course then looks at the specificity of intellectualism as it appears in certain contexts through readings from Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Joshua Heschel, Jean-Paul Sartre, George Orwell, Naguib Mahfouz, Frantz Fanon, Eleanor Roosevelt, James Baldwin, Angela Davis, Martin Buber, Edward Said, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, and Toni Morrison.\n",
      "CPLT 646 Rise of the European Novel. Katie Trumpener, Rudiger Campe. In the eighteenth century, the novel became a popular literary form in many parts of Europe. Yet now-standard narratives of its \"rise\" often offer a temporally and linguistically foreshortened view. This seminar examines key early modern novels in a range of European languages, centered on the dialogue between highly influential eighteenth-century British and French novels (Montesquieu, Defoe, Sterne, Diderot, Laclos, Edgeworth). We begin by considering a sixteenth-century Spanish picaresque life history (Lazarillo de Tormes) and Madame de Lafayette’s seventeenth-century secret history of French court intrigue; contemplate a key sentimental Goethe novella; and end with Romantic fiction (an Austen novel, a Kleist novella, Pushkin’s historical novel fragment). These works raise important issues about cultural identity and historical experience, the status of women (including as readers and writers), the nature of society, the vicissitudes of knowledge—and novelistic form. We also examine several major literary-historical accounts of the novel’s generic evolution, audiences, timing, and social function, and historiographical debates about the novel’s rise (contrasting English-language accounts stressing the novel’s putatively British genesis, and alternative accounts sketching a larger European perspective). The course gives special emphasis to the improvisatory, experimental character of early modern novels, as they work to reground fiction in the details and reality of contemporary life. Many epistolary, philosophical, sentimental, and Gothic novels present themselves as collections of \"documents\"—letters, diaries, travelogues, confessions—carefully assembled, impartially edited, and only incidentally conveying stories as well as information. The seminar explores these novels’ documentary ambitions; their attempt to touch, challenge, and change their readers; and their paradoxical influence on \"realist\" conventions (from the emergence of omniscient, impersonal narrators to techniques for describing time and place).\n",
      "CPLT 660 Writing Muslims. Shawkat Toorawa. We read and enjoy the works of Leila Aboulela, Nadia Davids, Aisha Gawad, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Manzu Islam, Sorayya Khan, Laila Lalami, Hisham Matar and others, and such films as My Beautiful Laundrette, Surviving Sabu, and Ae Fond Kiss, paying special attention to articulations of displacement, faith, history, identity, and memory. We try to develop an understanding of how the \"diasporic\" or \"expatriate\" Muslim writes herself, her world, and her condition. All material in English.\n",
      "CPLT 663 Poetics of the Short Form. Austen Hinkley. This seminar investigates the rich German tradition of literary short forms, such as the aphorism, the fairy tale, and the joke. Our readings cover small works by major authors from the eighteenth through the early twentieth century, including novellas by Goethe, Kleist, and Droste-Hülshoff; fantastic tales by the Brothers Grimm and Kafka; and short philosophical texts by Lichtenberg, Nietzsche, and Benjamin. We focus on the ways in which short forms not only challenge our understanding of literature and philosophy, but also interact with a wide range of other fields of knowledge like medicine, natural science, law, and history. By considering the possibilities of these mobile and dynamic texts, we explore their power to change how we think about and act in the world. What can be said in an anecdote, a case study, or a novella that could not be said otherwise? How can short forms illuminate the relationship between the literary and the everyday? How might these texts transform our relationship to the short forms that we interact with in our own lives?\n",
      "CPLT 689 Art and Resistance in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Andrei Kureichyk. This interdisciplinary seminar is devoted to the study of protest art as part of the struggle of society against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It focuses on the example of the Soviet and post-Soviet transformation of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan, and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course begins by looking at the influence of the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: \"nonconformism,\" \"dissidence,\" \"mimicry,\" \"rebellion.\" The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism. These themes are explored at different levels through specific examples from the works and biographies of artists. Students immerse themselves in works of different genres: films, songs, performances, plays, and literary works.\n",
      "CPLT 889 Postcolonial Ecologies. Cajetan Iheka. This seminar examines the intersections of postcolonialism and ecocriticism as well as the tensions between these conceptual nodes, with readings drawn from across the global South. Topics of discussion include colonialism, development, resource extraction, globalization, ecological degradation, nonhuman agency, and indigenous cosmologies. The course is concerned with the narrative strategies affording the illumination of environmental ideas. We begin by engaging with the questions of postcolonial and world literature and return to these throughout the semester as we read primary texts, drawn from Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia. We consider African ecologies in their complexity from colonial through post-colonial times. In the unit on the Caribbean, we take up the transformations of the landscape from slavery, through colonialism, and the contemporary era. Turning to Asian spaces, the seminar explores changes brought about by modernity and globalization as well as the effects on both humans and nonhumans. Readings include the writings of Zakes Mda, Aminatta Forna, Helon Habila, Derek Walcott, Jamaica Kincaid, Ishimure Michiko, and Amitav Ghosh. The course prepares students to respond to key issues in postcolonial ecocriticism and the environmental humanities, analyze the work of the major thinkers in the fields, and examine literary texts and other cultural productions from a postcolonial perspective. Course participants have the option of selecting from a variety of final projects. Students can craft an original essay that analyzes primary text from a postcolonial and/or ecocritical perspective. Such work should aim at producing new insight on a theoretical concept and/or the cultural text. They can also produce an undergraduate syllabus for a course at the intersection of postcolonialism and environmentalism or write a review essay discussing three recent monographs focused on postcolonial ecocriticism.\n",

      "CPLT 904 Psychoanalysis: Key Conceptual Differences between Freud and Lacan I. Moira Fradinger. This is the first section of a year-long seminar (second section: CPLT 914) designed to introduce the discipline of psychoanalysis through primary sources, mainly from the Freudian and Lacanian corpuses but including late twentieth-century commentators and contemporary interdisciplinary conversations. We rigorously examine key psychoanalytic concepts that students have heard about but never had the chance to study. Students gain proficiency in what has been called \"the language of psychoanalysis,\" as well as tools for critical practice in disciplines such as literary criticism, political theory, film studies, gender studies, theory of ideology, psychology medical humanities, etc. We study concepts such as the unconscious, identification, the drive, repetition, the imaginary, fantasy, the symbolic, the real, and jouissance. A central goal of the seminar is to disambiguate Freud's corpus from Lacan's reinvention of it. We do not come to the \"rescue\" of Freud. We revisit essays that are relevant for contemporary conversations within the international psychoanalytic community. We include only a handful of materials from the Anglophone schools of psychoanalysis developed in England and the US. This section pays special attention to Freud's \"three\" (the ego, superego, and id) in comparison to Lacan's \"three\" (the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real). CPLT 914 devotes, depending on the interests expressed by the group, the last six weeks to special psychoanalytic topics such as sexuation, perversion, psychosis, anti-asylum movements, conversations between psychoanalysis and neurosciences and artificial intelligence, the current pharmacological model of mental health, and/or to specific uses of psychoanalysis in disciplines such as film theory, political philosophy, and the critique of ideology. Apart from Freud and Lacan, we will read work by Georges Canguilhem, Roman Jakobson, Victor Tausk, Émile Benveniste, Valentin Volosinov, Guy Le Gaufey, Jean Laplanche, Étienne Balibar, Roberto Esposito, Wilfred Bion, Félix Guattari, Markos Zafiropoulos, Franco Bifo Berardi, Barbara Cassin, Renata Salecl, Maurice Godelier, Alenka Zupančič, Juliet Mitchell, Jacqueline Rose, Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing, Eric Kandel, and Lera Boroditsky among others. No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis is needed. Starting out from basic questions, we study how psychoanalysis, arguably, changed the way we think of human subjectivity. Graduate students from all departments and schools on campus are welcome. The final assignment is due by the end of the spring term and need not necessarily take the form of a twenty-page paper. Taught in English. Materials can be provided to cover the linguistic range of the group.\n",

Films themselves take the lead in our discussions.\n",
      "CPLT 958 Black Iberia: Then and Now. Nicholas Jones. This graduate seminar examines the variety of artistic, cultural, historical, and literary representations of black Africans and their descendants—both enslaved and free—across the vast stretches of the Luso-Hispanic world and the United States. Taking a chronological frame, the course begins its study of Blackness in medieval and early modern Iberia and its colonial kingdoms. From there, we examine the status of Blackness conceptually and ideologically in Asia, the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. Toward the end of the semester, we concentrate on black Africans by focusing on Equatorial Guinea, sub-Saharan African immigration in present-day Portugal and Spain, and the politics of Afro-Latinx culture and its identity politics in the United States. Throughout the term, we interrogate the following topics in order to guide our class discussions and readings: bondage and enslavement, fugitivity and maroonage, animal imageries and human-animal studies, geography and maps, Black Feminism and Black Queer Studies, material and visual cultures (e.g., beauty ads, clothing, cosmetics, food, Blackface performance, royal portraiture, reality TV, and music videos), the Inquisition and African diasporic religions, and dispossession and immigration. Our challenging task remains the following: to see how Blackness conceptually and experientially is subversively fluid and performative, yet deceptive and paradoxical. This course will be taught in English, with all materials available in the original (English, Portuguese, Spanish) and in English translation.\n",

      "CPSC 464 Algorithms and their Societal Implications. Nisheeth Vishnoi. Today’s society comprises humans living in an interconnected world that is intertwined with a variety of sensing, communicating, and computing devices. Human-generated data is being recorded at unprecedented rates and scales, and powerful AI and ML algorithms, which are capable of learning from such data, are increasingly controlling various aspects of modern society: from social interactions. These data-driven decision-making algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence democratic processes. Thus, designing effective tools to govern modern society which reinforce its cherished values such as equity, justice, democracy, health, privacy, etc. has become paramount and requires a foundational understanding of how humans, data, and algorithms interact. This course is for students who would like to understand and address some of the key challenges and emerging topics at the aforementioned interplay between computation and society. On the one hand, we study human decision-making processes and view them through the lens of computation and on the other hand we study and address the limitations of artificial decision-making algorithms when deployed in various societal contexts.

These data-driven decision-making algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence democratic processes. Thus, designing effective tools to govern modern society which reinforce its cherished values such as equity, justice, democracy, health, privacy, etc. has become paramount and requires a foundational understanding of how humans, data, and algorithms interact. This course is for students who would like to understand and address some of the key challenges and emerging topics at the aforementioned interplay between computation and society. On the one hand, we study human decision-making processes and view them through the lens of computation, and on the other hand we study and address the limitations of artificial decision-making algorithms when deployed in various societal contexts. The focus is on developing solutions through a combination of foundational work such as coming up with the right definitions, modeling, algorithms, and empirical evaluation. The current focus is on bias and privacy, with additional topics including robustness, polarization, and democratic representation. The grade will be based on class participation and a project. The project grade will be determined by a midterm and endterm report/presentation. The course has four primary modules: (1) Data: human-generated data; data collection and aggregation; (2) Decision-Making Algorithms: human decision-making algorithms; traditional algorithmic decision-making models and methods; machine learning-based decision-making models and methods; (3) Bias: socio-technical contexts and underlying computational problems; definitions of fairness; interventions for ensuring fairness; human biases through the lens of computation; privacy; need for definitions of privacy; differential privacy; beyond differential privacy; (4) Other topics: robustness; polarization; elections and social choice.\n",

Students learn how to use appropriate techniques to portray personality, create fluid body motions and organic movements, staging gesture, thought, material, weight, and lip-synch. The sessions consist of demonstrations, viewing of related works, hands-on experimentation, and critique. Computer editing and the use of digital cameras, scanners, and Wacom tablets are critical skills that provide the foundation for this class.\n",

      "E&EB 295 Life in Motion: Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology. Joshua Moyer. Physiology is the study of the functions that organisms perform and how they use those functions to interact with the environment. To survive, grow, and reproduce, all organisms must acquire energy and avoid conditions that exceed their physiological limits. These interactions all involve motion—ions traveling across membranes, muscle fibers twitching, respiration, and locomotion, to name a few. In this course, we tackle physiological processes from both \"bottom up\" and \"top down\" approaches, with integration among these dimensions, to extract general physiological rules of life. Then, we link our discoveries to the broader context of ongoing global change, and consider whether and how organisms can physiologically respond to contemporary selective pressures. While the course focuses heavily on animal physiology, plants, fungi, and microbes are also featured.\n",
      "E&EB 322 Evolutionary Genetics. Jennifer Coughlan. Genetic variation is the currency by which natural selection is translated into evolutionary change. In this course we dissect patterns of genetic variation using an evolutionary mindset to ultimately understand what shapes genetic variation in nature and the potential for species to adapt to new and changing environments. This class unites two foundational fields of evolutionary genetics; quantitative genetics (the study of the genetic basis of complex traits) and population genetics (the study of gene variant frequencies across time and space), with an ultimate goal of understanding evolutionary change in nature. Although this course is lecture based, there is much opportunity for hands-on learning. Students use real-life and simulated genetic data to map the genetic basis of traits and investigate the evolutionary forces responsible for shaping genetic variation in nature. We also discuss how quantitative and population genetics theory are applied to the modern genomic era, particularly in the context of detecting genomic signatures of adaptation. Lastly, we discuss the application of evolutionary genetics to human populations, including the usefulness and missteps of these applications for science and society.\n",

Students also learn many of the fundamentals associated with crafting and revising publishable scientific writing–a must for those seeking research-based graduate education in the sciences. By the end of the semester, students refine their critical thinking and scientific writing skills, and they have a newfound awareness of one of the most integrative and fascinating branches of vertebrate biology.\n",

Miller and Travis, 2022) covering the period 1970–1995, and one related contemporary paper published after 2010. We discuss how the concepts and themes introduced in classic papers have influenced the field of ecology and consider how new tools, data, and insights have advanced, diminished, or changed their impact. The Foundations book covers many topics, arranged into six core areas. Readings cover all six areas, but the included content varies depending on the interests of the class. Students are responsible for choosing one classic paper from Foundations, pairing it with one contemporary paper and leading the discussion during the class meeting.

Historically, pathogens and the diseases they cause were viewed largely from a biomedical perspective focused on interactions between pathogens and their human hosts. However, in the last few decades, the importance of studying pathogens from an ecological and evolutionary perspective has gained significant traction. These perspectives inform our understanding of almost all aspects of pathogen-host interactions from transmission dynamics and zoonotic disease spillover to the evolution of virulence and drug resistance. In this seminar, we dissect current and classic literature on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. Specifically, we: (i) discuss fundamental concepts in the field; (ii) identify persistent knowledge gaps; and (iii) explore opportunities for linkages between ecological, evolutionary, and biomedical perspectives.\n",

      "E&RS 629 Art and Resistance in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Andrei Kureichyk. This interdisciplinary seminar is devoted to the study of protest art as part of the struggle of society against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It focuses on the example of the Soviet and post-Soviet transformation of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan, and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course begins by looking at the influence of the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: \"nonconformism,\" \"dissidence,\" \"mimicry,\" \"rebellion.\" The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism. These themes are explored at different levels through specific examples from the works and biographies of artists. Students immerse themselves in works of different genres: films, songs, performances, plays, and literary works.\n",

What does it mean to move freely, and what kinds of bodies are granted that right? How is dance encoded as bodies move between various sites? In this team-taught class, we remap the field of dance through its migratory routes to understand how movement is shaped by the connections and frictions of ever-changing communities. As three dance scholars, bringing specialisms in West Indian dance, South Asian dance, and East Asian dance, we are looking to decenter the ways in which dance is taught, both in what we teach and in the ways we teach. Many of the dancers we follow create art inspired by migration, exile, and displacement (both within and beyond the nation) to write new histories of political belonging. Others trace migratory routes through mediums, ideologies, and technologies. The course is structured around four units designed to invite the remapping of dance through its many spaces of creativity: The Archive, The Studio, The Field, and The Stage. Throughout, we explore how different ideas of virtuosity, risk, precarity, radicalism, community, and solidarity are shaped by space and place. We rethink how local dance economies are governed by world markets and neoliberal funding models and ask how individual bodies can intervene in these global systems.\n",

      "EALL 807 Love, Death, and Life: Modern and Contemporary Chinese Literature. Tian Li. This course delves into the themes of love, death, and life in Chinese literature from the early twentieth century to contemporary People's Republic of China (PRC). We embark on a journey through the literary landscape of this transformative period, examining the profound cultural, social, and philosophical implications of love, death, and life in modern Chinese literature. The May Fourth Movement marked an era of enlightenment, nationalism, and women's liberation, where intellectuals championed \"love\" as a symbol of individual freedom, personal autonomy, and gender equality. How did the romantic discourse of \"free love\" begin as a revolt against Confucian patriarchy? How did the genre of romance aid the construction of the modern individual? How did changing gender relations affect literary productions? How does the evolving portrayal of life and death in Chinese literature inform our understanding of people's perceptions and attitudes towards the fundamental aspects of existence? What literary techniques and narrative strategies were employed to convey the complexities of love, death, and the human condition in modern China and beyond? By delving into literary works by both male and female writers, we examine how the concepts of life and death shape the construction of the modern individual and influence societal perceptions of personal fulfillment and the meaning of existence. Students develop a deep understanding of the cultural and historical context that influenced these literary works, as well as gain insights into the intricate relationship between literature, society, and individual identity. They are also equipped with the tools to analyze and interpret literary works within their historical and philosophical contexts. All readings are available in English translation.\n",

      "EAST 313 Contemporary Japan and the Ghosts of Modernity. Yukiko Koga. This course introduces students to contemporary Japan, examining how its defeat in the Second World War and loss of empire in 1945 continue to shape Japanese culture and society. Looking especially at the sphere of cultural production, it focuses on the question of what it means to be modern as expressed through the tension between resurgent neonationalism and the aspiration to internationalize. The course charts how the legacy of Japan’s imperial failure plays a significant role in its search for renewal and identity since 1945. How, it asks, does the experience of catastrophic failure—and failure to account for that failure—play into continued aspirations for modernity today? How does Japanese society wrestle with modernity’s two faces: its promise for progress and its history of catastrophic violence? The course follows the trajectory of Japan’s postwar nation-state development after the dissolution of empire, from its resurrection out of the ashes after defeat, to its identity as a US ally and economic superpower during the Cold War, to decades of recession since the 1990s and the search for new relations with its neighbors and new reckonings with its own imperial violence and postwar inactions against the background of rising neonationalism.\n",

      "EAST 324 Politics of Memory. Yukiko Koga. This course explores the role of memory as a social, cultural, and political force in contemporary society. How societies remember difficult pasts has become a contested site for negotiating the present. Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.\n",

      "EAST 427 Chinese Skin Problems. Quincy Ngan. This seminar uses artwork as a means of understanding the various skin problems faced by contemporary Chinese people. Divided into four modules, this seminar first traces how the \"ideal skin\" as a complex trope of desire, superficiality, and deception has evolved over time through the ghost story, Painted Skin (Huapi), and its countless spin-offs. Second, the course explores how artists have overcome a variety of social distances and barriers through touch; we look at artworks that highlight the healing power and erotic associations of cleansing, massaging, and moisturizing the skin. Third, we explore the relationship between feminism and gender stereotypes through artworks and performances that involve skincare, makeup and plastic surgery. Fourth, the course investigates the dynamics between \"Chineseness,\" colorism, and racial tensions through the artworks produced by Chinese-American and diasporic artists. Each module is comprised of one meeting focusing on theoretical frameworks and two meetings focusing on individual artists and close analysis of artworks. Readings include Cathy Park Hong’s Minor Feelings, Nikki Khanna’s Whiter, and Leta Hong Fincher’s Leftover Women.\n",
      "EAST 431 North Korea and Religion. Hwansoo Kim. Ever since the establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1948 and the Korean War (1950–1953), North Korea has been depicted by the media as a reclusive, oppressive, and military country, its leaders as the worst dictators, and its people as brainwashed, tortured, and starving to death. The still ongoing Cold War discourse, intensified by the North Korea’s recent secret nuclear weapons program, furthers these negative images, and outsiders have passively internalized these images. However, these simplistic characterizations prevent one from gaining a balanced understanding of and insight into North Korea and its people on the ground. Topics other than political, military, and security issues are rarely given attention. On the whole, even though North Korea’s land area is larger than South Korea and its population of 25 million accounts for a third of all Koreans, North Korea has been neglected in the scholarly discussion of Korean culture. This class tries to make sense of North Korea in a more comprehensive way by integrating the political and economic with social, cultural, and religious dimensions. In order to accomplish this objective, students examine leadership, religious (especially cultic) aspects of the North Korean Juche ideology, the daily lives of its citizens, religious traditions, the Korean War, nuclear development and missiles, North Korean defectors and refugees, human rights, Christian missionary organizations, and unification, among others. Throughout, the course places North Korean issues in the East Asian and global context. The course draws upon recent scholarly books, articles, journals, interviews with North Korean defectors, travelogues, media publications, and visual materials.\n",

      "EAST 515 Culture, History, Power, and Representation. Helen Siu. This seminar critically explores how anthropologists use contemporary social theories to formulate the junctures of meaning, interest, and power. It thus aims to integrate symbolic, economic, and political perspectives on culture and social process. If culture refers to the understandings and meanings by which people live, then it constitutes the conventions of social life that are themselves produced in the flux of social life, invented by human activity. Theories of culture must therefore illuminate this problematic of agency and structure. They must show how social action can both reproduce and transform the structures of meaning, the conventions of social life. Even as such a position becomes orthodox in anthropology, it raises serious questions about the possibilities for ethnographic practice and theoretical analysis. How, for example, are such conventions generated and transformed where there are wide differentials of power and unequal access to resources? What becomes of our notions of humans as active agents of culture when the possibilities for maneuver and the margin of action for many are overwhelmed by the constraints of a few? How do elites—ritual elders, Brahmanic priests, manorial lords, factory-managers—secure compliance to a normative order? How are expressions of submission and resistance woven together in a fabric of cultural understandings? How does a theory of culture enhance our analyses of the reconstitution of political authority from traditional kingship to modern nation-state, the encapsulation of pre-capitalist modes of production, and the attempts to convert \"primordial sentiments\" to \"civic loyalties\"? How do transnational fluidities and diasporic connections make instruments of nation-states contingent? These questions are some of the questions we immediately face when probing the intersections of culture, politics and representation, and they are the issues that lie behind this seminar.\n",
      "EAST 546 Cultures and Markets: Asia Connected through Time and Space. Helen Siu.

Finance flows that connect East Asia and the Indian Ocean to the Middle East and Africa. The cultures of capital and market in the neoliberal and postsocialist world.\n",
      "EAST 616 Socialist '80s: Aesthetics of Reform in China and the Soviet Union. Jinyi Chu. This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of the complex cultural and political paradigms of late socialism from a transnational perspective by focusing on the literature, cinema, and popular culture of the Soviet Union and China in 1980s. How were intellectual and everyday life in the Soviet Union and China distinct from and similar to that of the West of the same era? How do we parse \"the cultural logic of late socialism?\" What can today’s America learn from it? Examining two major socialist cultures together in a global context, this course queries the ethnographic, ideological, and socio-economic constituents of late socialism. Students analyze cultural materials in the context of Soviet and Chinese history. Along the way, we explore themes of identity, nationalism, globalization, capitalism, and the Cold War. Students with knowledge of Russian and Chinese are encouraged to read in original. All readings are available in English.\n",

      "EDST 211 Latinx Communities and Education in the United States. This course is an interdisciplinary and comparative study of Latinx communities and their experiences with K-12 education in the United States. The Latinx population in the United States continues to grow, with the Census Bureau projecting that the Latinx population will comprise 27.5 percent of the nation’s population by 2060.[1] In fact, in 2018, more than a quarter of the nation’s newborns were Latinx.[2] Yet, even as the Latinx population continues to grow, the education field has a relatively broad understanding of Latinx communities in the United States–frequently treating them as a monolith when designing everything from curriculum to education reform policies. To understand why such an approach to education studies may yield limited insight on Latinx communities, the course draws on research about the broader histories and experiences of Latinx communities in the United States before returning to the topic of K-12 education.\n",
      "EDST 228 Contemporary Topics in Social and Emotional Learning. Christina Cipriano. While our nation's youth are increasingly more anxious and disconnected than ever before, social and emotional learning, or SEL, is being politicized by arguments without empirical evidence. The reality is that due in part to its interdisciplinary origins, and in part to its quick uptake, what SEL is, why it matters, and who it benefits, has garnered significant attention since its inception. Key questions and discourse over the past three decades include if SEL skills are: another name for personality, soft skills, 21st century skills, or emotional intelligence, are SEL skills stand-alone or do they need to be taught together and in sequence, for how long does the intervention need to last to be effective, how do you assess SEL, are SEL skills culturally responsive and universally applicable, and can SEL promote the conditions for education equity? In this seminar, students unpack these key questions and challenge and evolve the current discourse through seminal and contemporary readings, writing, and artifact analyses. Students are provided with the opportunity to engage critically with the largest data set amassed to date of the contemporary evidence for SEL.\n",
      "EDST 232 US Federal Education Policy. Eleanor Schiff. Though education policy is typically viewed as a state and local issue, the federal government has taken a significant role in shaping policy since the end of World War II. The centralization of education policy has corresponded with changing views in society for what constitutes an equitable educational opportunity. This class is divided into three topics: 1) the federal role in education broadly (K-12) and the accountability movement in K-12: from the No Child Left Behind Act to the Common Core State Standards (and cross-national comparisons to US schools), 2) federal role in higher education, and 3) the education industry (teachers unions and think tanks).\n",

      "EDST 263 Place, Race, and Memory in Schools. Errol Saunders. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement and widespread, multiracial protests calling for racial justice across the United States, there is a renewed interest in the roles that schools play in perpetuating racial disparities in American society and the opportunities that education writ large might provide for remedying them. As places, schools both shape and are profoundly shaped by the built environment and the everyday experiences of the people that interact with them. Teachers, administrators, students, and parents are impacted by the racialized memories to explain the past, justify the present, and to move them to action for the future. These individual and collective memories of who and where they are, and the traumas, successes, failures, and accomplishments that they have with regard to school and education are essential to understanding how schools and school reforms work. Grounded in four different geographies, this course examines how the interrelationships of place, race, and memory are implicated in reforms of preK-12 schools in the United States. The course uses an interdisciplinary approach to study these phenomena, borrowing from commensurate frameworks in sociology, anthropology, political science, and memory studies with the goal of examining multiple angles and perspectives on a given issue.\n",
      "EDST 281 What is the University?. Mordechai Levy-Eichel. The University is one of the most influential—and underexamined—kinds of corporations in the modern world. It is responsible both for mass higher education and for elite training. It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective. Topics include: tenure, endowments, the committee system, the growth of degrees, the aims of research, peer-review, the nature of disciplinary divisions, as well as a host of other issues.\n",

      "EHS 544 Climate Equity and Health Policy Methods. Suzi Ruhl. Climate change presents threats to human health and well-being, while escalating health inequities. These health impacts can be direct, indirect, and cumulative. Concomitantly, efforts to prevent and respond to climate change can offer beneficial health impacts to vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. This course focuses on policy research methods, offers a policy to practice approach, and is accountable to communities most vulnerable to climate change. As a foundation, the course explores the \"face of climate inequity\" considering structural biases, social inequities, and racism that undermine health and create challenges for those most vulnerable to climate change. It also increases awareness of cultural values and practices that should be considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of climate equity and health policies and programs. Further, the framework of the course triangulates rule of law, evidence-based methodologies, and meaningful engagement. It introduces the basic principle of \"rule of law\" as a means to navigate government policy making with an understanding of administrative law and relevant environmental laws. It builds on this foundation to explore policy methods buttressed by evidence that is based on academic and lived experience expertise. It addresses mapping tools and data analysis accountable to disadvantaged populations. It incorporates consideration of \"meaningful engagement\" of vulnerable populations, with a special focus on the disproportionate impacts of climate change on the whole health of disadvantaged individuals, families, and communities. Further, key health topics are highlighted through integrative case studies, including climate resiliency and family mental health and health care systems.

      "EMST 546 Rise of the European Novel. Katie Trumpener, Rudiger Campe. In the eighteenth century, the novel became a popular literary form in many parts of Europe. Yet now-standard narratives of its \"rise\" often offer a temporally and linguistically foreshortened view. This seminar examines key early modern novels in a range of European languages, centered on the dialogue between highly influential eighteenth-century British and French novels (Montesquieu, Defoe, Sterne, Diderot, Laclos, Edgeworth). We begin by considering a sixteenth-century Spanish picaresque life history (Lazarillo de Tormes) and Madame de Lafayette’s seventeenth-century secret history of French court intrigue; contemplate a key sentimental Goethe novella; and end with Romantic fiction (an Austen novel, a Kleist novella, Pushkin’s historical novel fragment). These works raise important issues about cultural identity and historical experience, the status of women (including as readers and writers), the nature of society, the vicissitudes of knowledge—and novelistic form. We also examine several major literary-historical accounts of the novel’s generic evolution, audiences, timing, and social function, and historiographical debates about the novel’s rise (contrasting English-language accounts stressing the novel’s putatively British genesis, and alternative accounts sketching a larger European perspective). The course gives special emphasis to the improvisatory, experimental character of early modern novels, as they work to reground fiction in the details and reality of contemporary life. Many epistolary, philosophical, sentimental, and Gothic novels present themselves as collections of \"documents\"—letters, diaries, travelogues, confessions—carefully assembled, impartially edited, and only incidentally conveying stories as well as information. The seminar explores these novels’ documentary ambitions; their attempt to touch, challenge, and change their readers; and their paradoxical influence on \"realist\" conventions (from the emergence of omniscient, impersonal narrators to techniques for describing time and place).\n",
      "EMST 667 Black Iberia: Then and Now. Nicholas Jones. This graduate seminar examines the variety of artistic, cultural, historical, and literary representations of black Africans and their descendants—both enslaved and free—across the vast stretches of the Luso-Hispanic world and the United States. Taking a chronological frame, the course begins its study of Blackness in medieval and early modern Iberia and its colonial kingdoms. From there, we examine the status of Blackness conceptually and ideologically in Asia, the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. Toward the end of the semester, we concentrate on black Africans by focusing on Equatorial Guinea, sub-Saharan African immigration in present-day Portugal and Spain, and the politics of Afro-Latinx culture and its identity politics in the United States. Throughout the term, we interrogate the following topics in order to guide our class discussions and readings: bondage and enslavement, fugitivity and maroonage, animal imageries and human-animal studies, geography and maps, Black Feminism and Black Queer Studies, material and visual cultures (e.g., beauty ads, clothing, cosmetics, food, Blackface performance, royal portraiture, reality TV, and music videos), the Inquisition and African diasporic religions, and dispossession and immigration. Our challenging task remains the following: to see how Blackness conceptually and experientially is subversively fluid and performative, yet deceptive and paradoxical. This course will be taught in English, with all materials available in the original (English, Portuguese, Spanish) and in English translation.\n",
      "EMST 671 Research Seminar in Intellectual History. Isaac Nakhimovsky. The primary aim of this seminar is to provide a venue for writing research papers on individually chosen topics.

      "EMST 700 Workshop in Early Modern Studies. Nicholas Jones. What is the nature of the \"early modern\" as a temporal, conceptual, and socio-political category in humanistic study? How did it emerge as an interdisciplinary framework and how does it relate to concepts of the medieval, the Renaissance, classicism, and modernity? Can \"early modern\" be usefully deployed to speak of non-Western geographic and political formations, and if not, why? Broadly focused on the historical period between 1350 and 1800, this seminar considers the many transitions to modernity across the globe and explores how scholars across the disciplines have crafted narratives to highlight its significance. Taken over an entire academic year, as two half-credit courses, the workshop provides a historiographic, theoretical, and methodological introduction to key questions in the field through a dynamic engagement with a series of research presentations by scholars within and beyond Yale (must be taken concurrently with EMST 800a/801b).

We study a range of primary sources—narrative, poetic, theatrical, and pictorial—and consider a variety of cultural practices, including performance, visual art and architecture, dress, music, and dance, in order to address issues of coloniality and transculturation in Latin America from 1492 to the eighteenth century.\n",
      "EMST 748 Circa 1600. Kishwar Rizvi. This seminar focuses on the art , architecture, and urbanism of early modern empires across West, Central and South Asia, namely, the Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, and Shibanid, and their political and economic ties across the world. The year 1600 is an important temporal hinge, at the height of socio-political migrations and before the realization of full-scale European colonial ambitions. It is also the period of absolutism and millenarian activity, of slavery and the novel, and the institution of new religious and ethnic allegiances. In this manner art and architectural history served at the nexus of commensurability and competition, where artists, merchants, and missionaries crossed geographic and disciplinary borders in order to imagine a new world and their place within it.\n",

      "ENGL 033 Words, Words, Words: The Structure and History of English Words. Peter Grund. Meggings. Perpendicular. Up. Ain’t. Eerily. Bae. The. These are all words in the English language, but, like all words, they have different meanings, functions, and social purposes; indeed, the meaning and function may be different for the same word depending on the context in which we use it (whether spoken or written). In this course, we explore the wonderful world of words. We look at how we create new words (and why), how we change the meaning of words, and how words have been lost (and revived) over time. As we do so, we look at debates over words and their meanings now (such as the feeling by some that ain’t is not a word at all) and historically (such as the distaste for subpeditals for ‘shoes’ in the sixteenth century), and how words can be manipulated to insult, hurt, and discriminate against others. We look at a wide range of texts by well-known authors (such as Shakespeare) as well as anonymous online bloggers, and we make use of online tools like the Google Ngram viewer and the Corpus of Historical American English to see how words change over time. At the end of the course, I hope you see how we make sophisticated use of words and how studying them opens up new ways for you to understand why other people use words the way they do and how you can use words for various purposes in your own speech and writing.\n",

      "ENGL 245 Land, Liberty, and Slavery from Hobbes to Defoe. Feisal Mohamed. This course considers together several phenomena often considered separately: the conversion of arable land to pasture; the central place of property in seventeenth-century English formulations of political liberty; and the increasing racialization of forced labor in the period. We read seminal works of political theory produced in England’s tumultuous seventeenth century, namely those of Hobbes and Locke. We also explore how transformations of labor and property necessarily exert influence in literature, focusing on Andrew Marvell, Aphra Behn, John Dryden, and Daniel Defoe.\n",
      "ENGL 246 The Media and Democracy. Joanne Lipman. In an era of \"fake news,\" when trust in mainstream media is declining, social platforms are enabling the spread of misinformation, and new technologies are transforming the way we consume news, how do journalists hold power to account? What is the media’s role in promoting and protecting democracy? Students explore topics including objectivity versus advocacy and hate speech versus First Amendment speech protections. Case studies will span from 19th century yellow journalism to the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter movements, to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and the advent of AI journalism.\n",
      "ENGL 251 Experiments in the Novel: The Eighteenth Century. Jill Campbell. The course provides an introduction to English-language novels of the long eighteenth century (1688-1818), the period in which the novel has traditionally been understood to have \"risen.\" Emphasizing the experimental nature of novel-writing in this early period of its history, the course foregrounds persistent questions about the genre as well as a literary-historical survey: What is the status of fictional characters? How does narrative sequence impart political or moral implications? How do conventions of the novel form shape our experience of gender? What kind of being is a narrator? Likely authors include Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Laurence Sterne, Maria Edgeworth, Jane Austen, Jennifer Egan, Colson Whitehead, and Richard Powers.\n",
      "ENGL 262 Modernities: Nineteenth-Century Historical Narratives. Stefanie Markovits, Stuart Semmel.

      "ENGL 267 Love and Desire in the Nineteenth Century. Naomi Levine. Exploration of forms of love and desire in Victorian literature, with attention to their philosophical, historical, and aesthetic contexts.

      "ENGL 306 Interpretations Seminar: William Blake. Riley Soles. This course explores the world of William Blake’s poetry, with an emphasis on the longer prophetic poems, in conversation with his artistic output. We locate Blake in his historical moment, responding in his poetry and art to a variety of political, philosophical, and aesthetic movements in England and elsewhere. We also see Blake as part of an evolving literary tradition, paying particular attention to his relationship with his poetic precursor John Milton, and to Romantic contemporaries such as William Wordsworth. Trips to the Beinecke Library and the Yale Center for British Art allow us to see firsthand and to think deeply about the materiality of Blake’s works, as well as the complex relationships in them between text and image. Finally, we consider Blake as a radical religious thinker and innovator by analyzing his poetry’s connections to modes of Biblical vision, prophecy, and apocalypse.\n",
      "ENGL 327 The Modernist Novel in the 1920s. Joe Cleary. Many of the classics of modernist fiction were published between 1920 and 1930. These novels did not come into the world as \"modernist\"; that term was later conferred on narrative experiments often considered bizarre at the time. As writers, the \"modernists\" did not conform to pre-existing social conceptions of \"the writer\" nor work with established systems of narrative genres; rather, they tried to remake the novel as form and bend it to new purposes. This course invites students to consider diverse morphologies of the Anglophone modernist novel in this decade and to reflect on its consequences for later developments in twentieth-century fiction. The seminar encourages careful analyses of individual texts but engages also with literary markets, patronage systems, changing world literary systems, the rise of cinema and mass and consumer cultures, and later Cold War constructions of the ideology of modernism.\n",
      "ENGL 330 Henry James. Ruth Yeazell. Selected novels by Henry James, from Roderick Hudson through The Golden Bowl. Particular attention to the international theme and to the ways in which James's later novels revisit and transform the matter of his earlier ones. Formerly ENGL 435.\n",
      "ENGL 335 Literatures of the Plague. Jim Berger. In a new era of pandemic, we have seen how widespread medical crisis has profound effects on individual life and consciousness, and on political and economic institutions and practices. Our material and psychic supply chains grow tenuous. All of life changes even as we try to preserve what we deem most valuable. We must rethink what we consider to be \"essential.\" Yet this is far from being a new condition. Infectious disease has been part of the human social world probably since the beginnings of urban life. The Bible describes plagues sent by God as punishment. The earliest historical depiction was by Thucydides shortly after the plague in Athens in 430 BCE. At each occasion, people have tried to witness and to understand these \"visitations,\" as Daniel Defoe called them. The Plague is always a medical, political, economic and an interpretive crisis. It is also a moral crisis, as people must not only try to understand but also determine how to act. This course studies accounts of pandemics, from Thucydides in Athens up to our ongoing Coronavirus outbreaks. We trace the histories of understanding that accompanied pandemics: religious, scientific, philosophical, ethical, literary. It seems to be the case that these vast, horrifying penetrations of death into the fabric of life have inspired some of our fragile and resilient species’ most strange and profound meditations.\n",
      "ENGL 365 Donne. Catherine Nicholson. Depending on whom you ask, the seventeenth-century writer and cleric John Donne was either England's greatest love poet or a total misogynist dirtbag, a man devoted to God or a heretical apostate, an upwardly mobile striver or the victim of his own passionate idealism, the author of some of the most beautiful lines of poetry and prose in the English language or the man who took that language and nearly broke it. In this class, we won’t try to decide any of these arguments—though you are always welcome to pick a side—but to explore the brilliant, weird, fascinatingly complex body of writing that set them in motion.\n",
      "ENGL 366 American Experimental Theater. Marc Robinson.

      "ENGL 376 Theories and Histories of the Western Novel. Joe Cleary. Widely considered the ‘youngest,’ most protean, and major literary form of the modern era, the novel has been associated variously with the disenchantment of premodern sacred orders, the rise of the European middle classes, the cultural articulation of the nation-state and other imagined communities, the criticism or reproduction of society, and many other purposes. This seminar offers an advanced introduction to twentieth-century theories and histories of the Western novel and considerations of the genres, techniques, and sociocultural functions associated with the novel form as it has evolved in Europe and the Americas between the eighteenth century and the present.\n",
      "ENGL 388 English Poetry in the Long 19th Century. David Bromwich. Survey of a wide range of English lyric poetry from Wordsworth to Edward Thomas.

Alongside the editorial process, students compose and revise their own original poems, becoming sharper poets by learning to read—and think—as discerning editors.\n",
      "ENGL 413 Literary Production: Prose. Samuel Huber. This course provides students with an in-depth look into contemporary literary production from all sides of the publishing process: writing, reading, and editing. Taught by current editors of The Yale Review, and housed at the Review’s offices, this course offers students invaluable hands-on experience at a state-of-the-art literary and cultural magazine.

Students are introduced to the concept of assigning pieces and thinking about what kind of magazine stories can add value to an ever-more fast-paced and reactive media landscape. They read fiction and nonfiction submissions from our queue and discuss which pieces might be worth publishing, and why. And they follow and work on drafts of pieces as they go through the process of editing, promotion, and publication. Along the way, they may also write and revise a creative piece of their own, becoming better writers by learning to read and think as editors.\n",

      "ENGL 723 Rise of the European Novel. Katie Trumpener, Rudiger Campe. In the eighteenth century, the novel became a popular literary form in many parts of Europe. Yet now-standard narratives of its \"rise\" often offer a temporally and linguistically foreshortened view. This seminar examines key early modern novels in a range of European languages, centered on the dialogue between highly influential eighteenth-century British and French novels (Montesquieu, Defoe, Sterne, Diderot, Laclos, Edgeworth). We begin by considering a sixteenth-century Spanish picaresque life history (Lazarillo de Tormes) and Madame de Lafayette’s seventeenth-century secret history of French court intrigue; contemplate a key sentimental Goethe novella; and end with Romantic fiction (an Austen novel, a Kleist novella, Pushkin’s historical novel fragment). These works raise important issues about cultural identity and historical experience, the status of women (including as readers and writers), the nature of society, the vicissitudes of knowledge—and novelistic form. We also examine several major literary-historical accounts of the novel’s generic evolution, audiences, timing, and social function, and historiographical debates about the novel’s rise (contrasting English-language accounts stressing the novel’s putatively British genesis, and alternative accounts sketching a larger European perspective). The course gives special emphasis to the improvisatory, experimental character of early modern novels, as they work to reground fiction in the details and reality of contemporary life. Many epistolary, philosophical, sentimental, and Gothic novels present themselves as collections of \"documents\"—letters, diaries, travelogues, confessions—carefully assembled, impartially edited, and only incidentally conveying stories as well as information. The seminar explores these novels’ documentary ambitions; their attempt to touch, challenge, and change their readers; and their paradoxical influence on \"realist\" conventions (from the emergence of omniscient, impersonal narrators to techniques for describing time and place).\n",
      "ENGL 889 Postcolonial Ecologies. Cajetan Iheka. This seminar examines the intersections of postcolonialism and ecocriticism as well as the tensions between these conceptual nodes, with readings drawn from across the global South. Topics of discussion include colonialism, development, resource extraction, globalization, ecological degradation, nonhuman agency, and indigenous cosmologies. The course is concerned with the narrative strategies affording the illumination of environmental ideas. We begin by engaging with the questions of postcolonial and world literature and return to these throughout the semester as we read primary texts, drawn from Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia. We consider African ecologies in their complexity from colonial through post-colonial times. In the unit on the Caribbean, we take up the transformations of the landscape from slavery, through colonialism, and the contemporary era. Turning to Asian spaces, the seminar explores changes brought about by modernity and globalization as well as the effects on both humans and nonhumans. Readings include the writings of Zakes Mda, Aminatta Forna, Helon Habila, Derek Walcott, Jamaica Kincaid, Ishimure Michiko, and Amitav Ghosh. The course prepares students to respond to key issues in postcolonial ecocriticism and the environmental humanities, analyze the work of the major thinkers in the fields, and examine literary texts and other cultural productions from a postcolonial perspective. Course participants have the option of selecting from a variety of final projects. Students can craft an original essay that analyzes primary text from a postcolonial and/or ecocritical perspective. Such work should aim at producing new insight on a theoretical concept and/or the cultural text. They can also produce an undergraduate syllabus for a course at the intersection of postcolonialism and environmentalism or write a review essay discussing three recent monographs focused on postcolonial ecocriticism.\n",
      "ENGL 906 Michel Foucault I: The Works, The Interlocutors, The Critics. This graduate-level course presents students with the opportunity to develop a thorough, extensive, and deep (though still not exhaustive!) understanding of the oeuvre of Michel Foucault, and his impact on late-twentieth-century criticism and intellectual history in the United States. Non-francophone and/or U.S. American scholars, as Lynne Huffer has argued, have engaged Foucault’s work unevenly and frequently in a piecemeal way, due to a combination of the overemphasis on The History of Sexuality, Vol 1 (to the exclusion of most of his other major works), and the lack of availability of English translations of most of his writings until the early twenty-first century. This course seeks to correct that trend and to re-introduce Foucault’s works to a generation of graduate students who, on the whole, do not have extensive experience with his oeuvre. In this course, we read almost all of Foucault’s published writings that have been translated into English (which is almost all of them, at this point). We read all of the monographs, and all of the Collège de France lectures, in chronological order. This lightens the reading load; we read a book per week, but the lectures are shorter and generally less dense than the monographs. [The benefit of a single author course is that the more time one spends reading Foucault’s work, the easier reading his work becomes.] We read as many of the essays he published in popular and more widely-circulated media as we can. The goal of the course is to give students both breadth and depth in their understanding of Foucault and his works, and to be able to situate his thinking in relation to the intellectual, social, and political histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Alongside Foucault himself, we read Foucault’s mentors, interlocutors, and inheritors (Heidegger, Marx, Blanchot, Canguilhem, Derrida, Barthes, Althusser, Bersani, Hartman, Angela Davis, etc); his critics (Mbembe, Weheliye, Butler, Said, etc.), and scholarship that situates his thought alongside contemporary social movements, including student, Black liberation, prison abolitionist, and anti-psychiatry movements.\n",
      "ENGL 909 Literary Criticism Now. Jonathan Kramnick. This course examines and takes the temperature of the current state of literary studies. It asks, what is at stake in the practice of literary criticism today and what shapes does contemporary criticism take? We look at some recent attempts at synthesis and polemical intervention. We then organize our discussion around treatments of reading, form, medium, experimental criticism, and public criticism.\n",
      "ENGL 920 Foundations of Film and Media. John MacKay. The course sets in place some undergirding for students who want to anchor their film interest to the professional discourse of this field. A coordinated set of topics in film theory is interrupted first by the often discordant voice of history and second by the obtuseness of the films examined each week. Films themselves take the lead in our discussions.\n",
      "ENGL 935 The Beautiful Struggle: Blackness, the Archive, and the Speculative. Daphne Brooks. This seminar takes its inspiration from concepts and questions centering theories that engage experimental methodological approaches to navigating the opacities of the archive: presumptively \"lost\" narratives of black life, obscure(d) histories, compromised voices and testimonials, contested (auto)biographies, anonymous testimonies, textual aporias, fabulist documents, confounding marginalia. The scholarly and aesthetic modes by which a range of critics and poets, novelists, dramatists, and historians have grappled with such material have given birth to new analytic lexicons—from Saidiya Hartman’s \"critical fabulation\" to José Estaban Muñoz’s \"ephemera as evidence\" to Tavia Nyong’o’s \"Afrofabulation.\" Such strategies affirm the centrality of speculative thought and invention as vital and urgent forms of epistemic intervention in the hegemony of the archive and open new lines of inquiry in black studies. Our class explores a variety of texts that showcase these new queries and innovations, and we also actively center our efforts from within the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, where a number of sessions are held and where we focus on Beinecke holdings that resonate with units of the course. Various sessions also feature distinguished guest interlocutors via Zoom, who are on hand to discuss the specifics of their research methods and improvisational experimentations in both archival exploration and approaches to their prose and poetic projects.\n",
      "ENGL 957 Ecologies of Black Print. Jacqueline Goldsby. A survey of history of the book scholarship germane to African American literature and the ecosystems that have sustained black print cultures over time. Secondary works consider eighteenth- to twenty-first-century black print culture practices, print object production, modes of circulation, consumption, and reception. Students write critical review essays, design research projects, and write fellowship proposals based on archival work at the Beinecke Library, Schomburg Center, and other regional sites (e.g., the Sterling A. Brown papers at Williams College).\n",
      "ENGL 961 Transformations of the Confession: Secularism, Slavery, Sexuality. Caleb Smith. The confession is a paradoxical speech act. Confessors are supposed to reveal the inmost secrets of themselves, but at the same time they are known to be performing, according to an established script, for an audience endowed with the capacity to judge and punish them. This seminar takes up the genre of the public confession. We sketch its genealogy from ancient religious styles of truth-telling (The Confessions of St. Augustine) to modern forms of evidence in criminal justice (The Confessions of Nat Turner) while giving special attention to its literary adaptations (The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater). We then explore the transformation of the confession during the nineteenth century under the pressures of secularization, the slavery crisis, and the emerging science of sexuality. Readings may include works by Augustine, Rousseau, De Quincey, Hogg, Poe, Jacobs, Douglass, Plath, Lorde, and Nabokov. Critical and theoretical sources include Nietzsche, Freud, Foucault, Butler, Brooks, Hartman, and Felski. We pursue some of the themes introduced during the annual conference of the English Institute at Yale in 2018, on the theme of \"truth-telling.\"\n",

      "ENRG 320 Energy, Engines, and Climate. Alessandro Gomez. The course aims to cover the fundamentals of a field that is central to the future of the world. The field is rapidly evolving and, although an effort will be made to keep abreast of the latest developments, the course emphasis is on timeless fundamentals, especially from a physics perspective. Topics under consideration include: key concepts of climate change as a result of global warming, which is the primary motivator of a shift in energy supply and technologies to wean humanity off fossil fuels; carbon-free energy sources, with primary focus on solar, wind and associated needs for energy storage and grid upgrade; and, traditional power plants and engines using fossil fuels, that are currently involved in 85% of energy conversion worldwide and will remain dominant for at least a few decades. Elements of thermodynamics are covered throughout the course as needed, including the definition of various forms of energy, work and heat as energy transfer, the principle of conservation of energy, first law and second law, and rudiments of heat engines. We conclude with some considerations on energy policy and with the \"big picture\" on how to tackle future energy needs. The course is designed for juniors and seniors in science and engineering.\n",

      "ENV 511 Ecological Foundations for Environmental Managers. Elizabeth Forbes. This course gives students a fundamental mechanistic understanding about the way abiotic (e.g., climate) and biotic (e.g., resources, competitors, predators) factors determine pattern in the distribution and abundance of species. Students learn how individuals within a species cope with changing environmental conditions by altering their behavior, making physiological adjustments, and changing the allocation of resources among survival, growth, and reproduction. Students learn how populations of species coexist within communities and how species interactions within communities can drive ecosystem functioning. Students also learn how ecologists use scientific insight to deal with emerging environmental problems such as protecting biodiversity, understanding the consequences of habitat loss on species diversity, and forecasting the effects of global climate change on species population viability and geographic distribution.\n",
      "ENV 512 Microeconomic Foundations for Environmental Managers. Kenneth Gillingham. This six-week course provides an introduction to microeconomic analysis and its application to environmental policy. Students study how markets work to allocate scarce resources. This includes consideration of how individuals and firms make decisions, and how policy analysts seek to quantify the benefits and costs of consumption and production. We consider the conditions under which markets are beneficial to society and when they fail. We see that market failure arises frequently in the context of environmental and natural resource management. The last part of the course focuses on the design of environmental and natural resource policies to address such market failures. The course is designed to cover basic knowledge of economics analysis and prepare students for ENV 834 and other more advanced offerings.\n",
      "ENV 521 Physical Science Foundations for Environmental Managers. Shimon Anisfeld. This required foundational course provides students with the physical science basics that they need to understand and manage environmental problems. The course draws on climatology, environmental chemistry, geology, hydrology, meteorology, oceanography, and soil science. Focus is on understanding both the underlying concepts and how they apply to real-world environmental challenges. Useful both as a freestanding course and as a gateway to a wide spectrum of intermediate and advanced courses.\n",
      "ENV 522 Human Science Foundations for Environmental Managers. Amity Doolittle. The environmental fields of inquiry that focus on human behavior, culture, governance, and history have matured and proliferated in the twenty-first century (environmental anthropology, environmental sociology, environmental governance, environmental history, environmental humanities, and more). This new scholarship has advanced the academic state of knowledge and sharpened our collective ability to understand human-environmental relations. Yet despite better science, we struggle to make material change in the collective rate of human consumption of Earth’s natural resources. Not only is the planet harmed by our failures, but millions of people are also harmed. Embedded in all scientific endeavors is a theory of change. But rarely are theories of change made explicit for environmental stewardship. In this course, we investigate new bodies of scholarship that explore relational values, varying concepts of stewardship, a range of theories of change, and, finally, capabilities or human rights-based measure of the life well lived. We explore the following questions: What does it mean to be an environmental steward in a world filled with social, political, and economic inequalities? How can we weave together multiple knowledge systems or ways of knowing through environmental stewardship? How can we balance the need for social and environmental change in a way that is both place-based and responsive to global concerns? Can theories of change help us act when the scientific data is both clear and uncertain? How can we incorporate non-economic measures of human well-being into our decision making?\n",
      "ENV 550 Natural Science Research Methods. Scott Carpenter, William Lauenroth. The course prepares students to design and execute an intensive research project. It covers elementary principles and philosophy of science; research planning, including preparation, criticism, and oral presentation of study plans; communicating research findings; limitations of research techniques; the structure of research organizations; and professional scientific ethics.\n",
      "ENV 551 Qualitative Inquiry and Environmental Human Sciences. Amity Doolittle. Qualitative research is a robust and reliable means of knowledge production and is central to exploring questions of the human condition. As an approach to understanding the human-nature nexus, qualitative research prioritizes multiple ways of knowing the world (epistemology), engages with philosophical concerns about how can we know what is \"truth\" (ontology), and ultimately seeks to design better futures (a normative endeavor based in values or axiology). The tools we explore include 1) oral methods (interviews, life histories, focus groups), (2) text-based methods (archival research and document or textual analysis), and (3) participatory methods based on observation and knowledge co-production. Students learn how to interpret and analyze qualitative data, as well as evaluate the claims made by qualitative researchers. The course is intended for doctoral students who are in the beginning stage of their dissertation research, as well as for MESc students developing research proposals for their thesis projects. Advanced undergraduate students are welcome. The final project for this course is a research proposal and annotated bibliography. While we discuss the value of mixed methods, this course does not cover quantitative approaches such as survey research, econometrics, Q methodology, spatial analysis, or social network analysis.\n",
      "ENV 553 Perspectives:  Environmental Leadership. Julie Zimmerman, Peter Boyd. The course is intended to offer a common experience and exposure to the variety of perspectives represented by YSE faculty and guest experts on the challenges and opportunities of environmental management. This year’s theme is Environmental Leadership, and over the term we create and foster a leadership toolkit and systems-thinking appreciation that enable first-year M.E.M. students to map out and maximize an impactful path through Yale, their careers, and their lives.\n",
      "ENV 568 Overshoot: The Environmental and Policy Implications of Exceeding 1.5°C. Wake Smith. Despite dire warnings from the IPCC and earnest pledges of various governments and other institutions including Yale, humanity is likely to surpass 1.5°C at the end of this decade, placing us in the dangerous realm of temperature \"overshoot.\" The course starts by examining our likely climate trajectory before critically examining the level of optimism that surrounds many proposed mitigation quick fixes. We then delve into the toolkit of climate responses that would become relevant in an overshoot scenario—not merely further mitigation and adaptation but also negative emissions technologies and strategies to reflect incoming sunlight. We examine not only the technological, economic, and political feasibility of these potential interventions but also their governance requirements and ethical implications. As I have found little literature illustrating what life in an overshoot world might entail, we create some. Our final project is to host a \"cli-fi\" short-story contest wherein students are asked to envision what they might see with their own eyes should the Earth transit 2C in mid-century. The entire course is framed via the lens of the Global Commission on Governing Risks from Climate Overshoot, an independent group of eminent global leaders assembled in 2022 to recommend strategies to reduce risks should global warming goals be exceeded. The Commission delivered its report to the UN General Assembly in September 2023. We examine the report in detail and are visited in class by both the U.S. delegate to the Commission (a YSE alumna) and the head of the Commission’s Secretariat. An optional field trip to Manhattan to witness the report’s initial press roll-out has been arranged (train fare is free to students).\n",
      "ENV 573 Urban Ecology for Local and Regional Decision-Making. Morgan Grove. Urban ecology is the interdisciplinary study of urban and urbanizing systems from local to global scales. While urban ecology shares many features with the biological science of ecology, it emphasizes linkages with social, economic, and physical sciences and the humanities. Geographically, the subject includes central and edge cities, suburbs of various ages and densities, and exurban settlements in which urban lifestyles and economic commitments are dominant. In application, urban ecology can be useful as a social-ecological science for making cities more sustainable, resilient, and equitable. Emerging \"grand challenges\" in urban ecology include the development of robust approaches to and understanding of (1) integrated social-ecological systems in urban and urbanizing environments; (2) the assembly and function of novel ecological communities and ecosystems under novel environmental conditions; (3) drivers of human well-being in diverse urban areas; (4) pathways for developing healthy, sustainable, and disaster-resilient cities; and (5) co-production of actionable science for policy, planning, design, and management.\n",
      "ENV 581 Transportation and Climate Change. Adam Millard-Ball. Transportation is the fastest-growing contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, worldwide, but has often been considered the most challenging sector to decarbonize. In this course, we critically analyze a range of policies to improve fuel economy, promote electric vehicles, and reduce vehicle travel. We briefly consider the range of infrastructure and policy changes that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. But we spend more time on the question of how these changes can be implemented and the tradeoffs between emission reductions, equity, safety, and other policy goals. The course has a US focus, but we bring in examples from other contexts from time to time.\n",
      "ENV 584 Applications of Industrial Ecology. Reid Lifset. Industrial ecology (IE) is an interdisciplinary environmental field that blends environmental and social science, engineering, management, and policy analysis. IE is centered on the study of physical resource flows through systems at different scales. The unusual name \"industrial ecology\" stems from an analogy made with biological ecosystems and borrows from it on several fronts, such as its focus on resource cycling, multi-scalar systems, resource and energy stocks and flows, and food webs. Increasingly, industrial ecology contributes insights into environmental management and policy on issues ranging from industrial waste to global climate change. This is a survey course that combines basic introductions to industrial ecology tools and concepts with examples of their use in environmental policy and management.\n",
      "ENV 592 Documentary Film Workshop. Charles Musser. This workshop in audiovisual scholarship explores ways to present research through the moving image. Students work within a Public Humanities framework to make a documentary that draws on their disciplinary fields of study. Designed to fulfill requirements for the M.A. with a concentration in Public Humanities.\n",
      "ENV 595 <i>Yale Environment Review</i>. Matthew Kotchen. The Yale Environment Review is a student-run publication that aims to increase access to the latest developments in environmental studies. We aim to shed light on cutting-edge environmental research through summaries, analysis, and interviews. During this one-credit course, students produce one or two articles on subjects of their choosing for publication on the YER website. Please refer to our website and Canvas for an overview of the different types of content that YER produces. Students receive coaching to improve their writing skills, and their work goes through a rigorous editing process. Participation in Yale Environment Review helps students sharpen their writing skills and familiarize themselves with science communication, and it provides a platform to showcase their expertise.\n",
      "ENV 600 Qualitative Data Analysis and Academic Writing. Amity Doolittle. What happens after qualitative fieldwork?  In this course, we will work through the complex, multi-staged process of qualitative data analysis (QDA). QDA, rarely examined in its full richness, includes at least 4 different processes. These are 1) learning the mechanics of coding qualitative data; 2) developing an analytical and interpretive lens—or your epistemological and theoretical orientation in relationship to other scholarship in your field; 3) cultivating the ability to communicate your findings, both in writing and verbally. 4) learning to demonstrate the rigor, trustworthiness, and credibility of qualitative scholarship. QDA, practiced as an emergent analytical process, requires approaching these processes concurrently. The first part of this course will focus on explicitly the first two steps of this process: coding and developing an analytical or interpretive lens. As we progress through the semester, we will also pay close attention to how scholars in our field navigate the third and fourth steps: communication of findings and demonstrating rigor, trustworthiness, and credibility—which we will refer to as expertise and authority. As such we will be developing a tactic understand of these crucial processes in social science. Due to the inherent interdisciplinarity and individualized nature of student research in YSE, students will need to be highly self-directed as they engage with their own data will need to be actively engaged in the peer-reviewed literature related to their specific field of interest. This course is designed for master or doctoral students designed for students who have completed a minimum of 8 weeks of qualitative research and are ready to analyze their own data.\n",
      "ENV 602 Ecosystems and Landscapes. Mark Bradford. Concepts and their application in ecosystem and landscape ecology. Topics covered include biogeochemical cycling, food web interactions, biodiversity, and the abiotic and biotic controls that act on them. The course emphasizes how to integrate this knowledge to understand and manage ecosystem budgets.\n",
      "ENV 603 Environmental Data Visualization for Communication. Jennifer Marlon, Simon Queenborough. Welcome to the Information Age! It is now much easier to generate and access more data than ever before. Yet, our ability to manage, analyze, understand, and communicate all this data is extremely limited. Visualization is a powerful means of enhancing our abilities to learn from data and to communicate results to others, especially when informed by insights into human behavior and social systems. Developing the quantitative skills necessary for analyzing data is important, but for addressing complex and often urgent environmental problems that involve diverse audiences: understanding how to effectively communicate with data is equally essential for researchers, policymakers, and the public alike. This course is for students who wish to gain an understanding of the principles, tools, and techniques needed to communicate effectively with data. The course primarily uses the programming language R. Students are required to demonstrate basic proficiency in this software before or during the course. Resources for learning R are provided. Classes consist of short lectures about principles of design, data preparation, and visual communication, discussions about examples from the news and scientific literature, guest lectures, peer critiques, and hands-on individual and collaborative group activities. Throughout the semester, we use Excel, PowerPoint, R, Tableau, and other tools to develop visualizations using diverse datasets. Students also work with a dataset of their own choice or from a partner organization to develop a final project consisting of a poster, infographic, report, dashboard, story map, or related product. Enrollment is limited and application is required.\n",
      "ENV 605 Environmental Risk Communication. Andrew Schwarz. Risk communication is a critical but often overlooked part of how organizations identify and manage risks. Effective risk communication can help people understand risks and determine appropriate responses to them. It should help people to take seriously risks they might otherwise ignore (e.g., to get vaccinated or evacuate from a coming hurricane), or to understand that certain activities do not pose significant risks. Effective risk communication enables environmental professionals to communicate information in a way that is understood and accepted by different stakeholders (e.g., the public, industry, government leaders, etc.) and allows the participation of these stakeholders in risk management decisions. This course provides an overview of the theory and practice of effective communication about environmental and health risks to diverse stakeholders. Students are expected to actively participate in class discussions, drawing upon assigned readings, lectures, and videos.\n",
      "ENV 610 Managing Ecosystems for Climate Change Solutions. Paulo Brando. This course explores how natural climate solutions (i.e., actions to protect, better manage and restore ecosystems) can mitigate climate change. It also assesses the challenges and barriers that must be overcome in order to make natural climate solutions more sustainable. During the course, students are exposed to concepts about how the conservation and management of natural and anthropogenic terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., conservation of natural ecosystems, forest and agriculture management, and restoration of degraded areas) have influenced the carbon and water cycles, two important climate services provided by terrestrial ecosystems. Students also address some of the potential socio-ecological consequences of nature-based solutions, with a focus in the tropics. Finally, the course covers some of the main challenges and opportunities for scaling up carbon natural climate solutions.\n",

      "ENV 624 The Science, Policy, and Management of GHG Removal Strategies. James Saiers, Matthew Kotchen. In order to avoid the worst effects of climate change, there is growing interest in the advancement of greenhouse gas (GHG) removal from the atmosphere as a complementary strategy to emission reductions. This interdisciplinary seminar covers the science, policy, and management of a broad range of GHG removal strategies. What are they? What is the current scientific basis? What are their potentials? And how might policy, markets, and institutions promote or impede GHG removal? While the seminar covers a set of nature-based climate solutions, we also consider more engineered approaches, along with original research related to advancing new technologies and program evaluation. The seminar is organized around readings in the primary literature with weekly student presentations and discussion.\n",
      "ENV 626 Writing for Publication in the Natural Sciences. Simon Queenborough. This course is intended to give students insights into the process of writing natural science manuscripts. The seminar guides students through writing a paper and ends the term with a submitted manuscript. We also consider various strategies for writing, accountability, time management, and productivity. The course is aimed at students in the natural sciences with cleaned and analyzed data that they want to write up for publication.\n",
      "ENV 631 Poverty, Environment, and Inequality. Dorceta Taylor. This course explores the relationship between poverty, environment, and social inequality. It examines how race and class interact in American rural and urban environments to produce or sustain inequalities. The course examines how structural factors and community characteristics influence environmental outcomes. Students begin by examining the relationship between degraded environments and poor schooling. They examine the environmental hazards that exist in or adjacent to urban and rural public schools. Students will analyze inner-city and poor rural communities as they examine disinvestment, the concentration of poverty, efforts to disperse the poor, and the potential for community revitalization. Students examine homelessness and the ways in which climate disasters impact housing experiences. The course also examines another aspect of poverty: the issue of food security; it looks at the rise in community gardening in poor communities as an attempt to combat lack of access to healthy food. Students examine residential segregation and zoning and study the spatial inequalities that arise from the siting of hazardous facilities in minority and low-income urban and rural communities. The course examines the classic environmental justice question: which came first the facilities or the people? It examines economic questions related to costs of hosting noxious facilities and if and how communities can seek compensation to host such facilities. The course also examines the quandary communities face when presented with economic models that seek to provide compensation – the question of the long-term health of the people and environment takes center stage as community residents seek to determine how to balance economic development with concerns about sustainability. Students analyze water, energy, and climate justice.\n",
      "ENV 632 Social Entrepreneurship Lab. Teresa Chahine. Social Entrepreneurship Lab is a practice-based course in which students from across campus form interdisciplinary teams to work on a social challenge of their choice. Teams include students from SOM, SPH, YSE, YDS, Jackson, and other schools and programs. Students apply the ten stage framework from the textbook \"Social Entrepreneurship: Building Impact Step by Step\" to identify, understand, and tackle a social or environmental challenge. Students start by identifying a topic area of focus, then form teams based on shared interests and complementary skills. Over the course of thirteen weeks, student teams delve into understanding the challenge through root cause analysis, research on existing solutions and populations affected; then apply human centered design thinking and systems thinking to design, prototype, test, and iterate solutions. This course builds on the SOM core course Innovator, and electives including Public Health Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship, Global Social Entrepreneurship, Managing Social Enterprises, Patterns in Entrepreneurship. Students who have not taken one of these courses must demonstrate experience with innovation and entrepreneurship either through professional experience or participation in extra-curricular programming through Innovate Health Yale (IHY at SPH), Program on Social Enterprise (PSE at SOM), Center for Business and the Environment (CBEY at YSE), Yale Center for Collaborative Arts and Media (CCAM), Dwight Hall, or Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale (CITY).\n",
      "ENV 633 Critical Race Theory. Gerald Torres. This class studies critical race theory from its origins to its current expression. Understanding the deep interconnections between race and law, and how race and law are co-constitutive, is the project of critical race theory. One of the central claims of critical race theory is that racial subordination is not a deviation from the liberal legal ideal but is, unfortunately, part of its expression. We focus on the origins of the critique that is central to the development of the theory and contrast its analysis with conventional analytic frameworks on race and American law and society. Because it is a positive theory but also driven by a normative vision, we explore the possibility of transforming the relationship between law and racial power. The law is not the only site of critical race theory; it has had a significant impact on other disciplines in the social sciences. We examine those impacts as well.\n",
      "ENV 641 Market-Based Mechanisms for Water Management. David Pilz, Sarah Kruse. This course provides students with both the theory and application of environmental water transactions (EWTs) to water management challenges, such as river restoration, drought-mitigation, and agricultural allocation. The geographic focus is primarily the western United States, as this region, out of necessity, has been very active in implementing EWTs in recent years. Other market-based mechanisms for water management also are explored, such as groundwater mitigation banks, urban stormwater markets, and water quality markets. The course also covers considerations such as environmental justice, tribal access to and use of water, and diversity/equity/inclusion in water management. A final project gives students the opportunity to develop a simple hydrological and water rights model for a fictional watershed to use as the basis for designing a suite of water transactions and market-based water management solutions. This is an online course taught by experienced professionals who value a hands-on approach to learning. In addition, the course features discussion of current events in water, case studies, and guest lectures from practitioners actively using market-based mechanisms for water management.\n",
      "ENV 642 Environmental Justice/Climate Justice. Gerald Torres. In this course, we focus on the evolution and development of the environmental justice movement. We pay particular attention to its embrace of climate justice, and we ask what conception of justice is at play in both the environmental justice and climate justice movements. We begin with a legal and social-historical survey but quickly bring the inquiry up to the current moment. We explore the legal and policy developments that have followed the environmental justice critique.\n",
      "ENV 645 Urbanization, Global Change, and Sustainability. Karen Seto. Urbanization and associated changes in human activities on the land (land use) and in the physical attributes of Earth’s surface (land cover) have profound environmental consequences. Aggregated globally, these effects constitute some of the most significant human impacts on the functioning of Earth as a system. This course examines the interactions and relationships between urbanization and global change at local, regional, and global scales with an emphasis on the biophysical aspects of urbanization. Topics include urbanization in the context of global land use change, habitat and biodiversity loss, modification of surface energy balance and the urban heat island, climate change and impacts on urban areas, urban biogeochemistry, and urbanization as a component of sustainability. Emphasis is on management of urban areas worldwide or at national scales for planetary sustainability.\n",
      "ENV 646 Foundations of Agriculture and Environment. Stephen Wood. Agricultural systems have a profound impact on the environment, but also depend on environmental processes—such as climate and nutrient cycling—for continued productivity. Because of this two-way relationship, there has been a growing integration of environmental and agricultural sciences over the past several decades with growing recognition that designing and implementing agricultural systems that minimize environmental harm and benefit people is necessary to sustainable development. This course provides foundational knowledge of how agricultural and environmental systems are linked. The goal is to provide theoretical understanding of the important environmental and human processes, as well as practical experience interpreting these processes and applying them to real-world scenarios.\n",
      "ENV 654 Structure, Function, and Development of Trees. Graeme Berlyn. This course focuses on two aspects of plant life: (1) basic processes that drive plant development, such as seed formation, germination, seedling establishment, maturation, and senescence; and (2) basic structure and function of plants (such as root systems, leaf formation and development, height, and diameter growth). Differences between different groups of seed plants are analyzed from structural, functional, ecological, and evolutionary standpoints. Special attention is given to woody plants and their importance in the biosphere and human life. Coverage includes tropical, temperate, and boreal trees. Plant biology is discussed in the context of physiological and structural adaptations in terms of strength, storage, and water and solute transport.\n",
      "ENV 660 Forest Dynamics. Marlyse Duguid. This course introduces the study of forest stand dynamics—how forest structures and compositions change over time with growth and disturbances. Understanding the dynamic nature of forest stands is important for creating and maintaining a variety of critical ecosystem services sustainably and synergistically, including sustainable supplies of wood products, biodiversity and wildlife habitats, water, fire protection, and others. Through readings, lectures, and discussions we explore forest development processes and pathways, concentrating on the driving mechanisms and emergent properties including natural and human disturbances. This course is a core component of the M.F. degree but is explicitly designed to be accessible to anyone interested in an in-depth exploration of forest ecosystems.\n",
      "ENV 671 Temperate Woody Plant Taxonomy and Dendrology. Marlyse Duguid. Dendrology literally translates as \"the study of trees\" and integrates morphology, phenology, ecology, biogeography, and the natural history of tree species. In this course students learn how to identify the major temperate woody plant families, with a focus on North American forest species. In addition, students learn the morphological and ecological traits used for field identification of woody plants. We use phylogenetic systematics as the structure for understanding the evolutionary history and relationships between species. Class periods consist of practical field and laboratory skills used in plant taxonomy and field lecturing. Weather permitting, we are in the field for the majority of class periods. We use an ecosystem focused approach for plant identification. Besides learning how to identify species, we discuss principles of plant ecology, biogeography, and natural history in each of the ecosystems we visit. Limited to thirteen.\n",
      "ENV 679 Plant Ecophysiology. Craig Brodersen. This course focuses on the physiological ecology of plants and their interaction with the biotic and abiotic environment, understood through the lens of first principles. We use a quantitative approach to demonstrate the linkages between photosynthesis, growth, and carbon allocation at the tissue and whole plant level, which can then be scaled up to forests and ecosystems. We also focus on specific physiological and anatomical adaptations plants use to survive in the many varied habitats on Earth. Enrollment limited to twenty-four.\n",
      "ENV 684 Forest Finance. Deborah Spalding. Understanding the tools used in financial analysis is an important component of successful forestland investment and forest management decision-making. This course provides students with a basic suite of financial tools used in the acquisition and management of forestland/timber. It includes an overview of traditional financial analysis metrics used in land acquisition, timber management, and risk management, as well as topics related to supply and demand for forest products, international timberland investment, and emerging trends in forestland investing. The first eight weeks of the course are in lecture format, and the remainder of the course is a case study/project that gives students an opportunity to apply their knowledge in the analysis of an actual \"deal.\"\n",
      "ENV 692 Science and Practice of Temperate Agroforestry. Meghan Giroux. This course explores the science and practices of temperate agroforestry, covering current knowledge of agroforestry science and shedding light on the myths and assumptions that have yet to be tested regarding the integration of trees in agricultural systems. The course begins with an overview of modern agriculture to help us better understand why agroforestry systems have potential to improve the sustainability of farming systems. We also cover the social science regarding agroforestry and why it has not been widely adopted. Silvopasture and forest farming systems are the primary focus, but windbreaks, alley cropping, and riparian forest buffers are also covered. The field of agroforestry has struggled with the promotion of hypothetical practices; this course introduces students to real-world production agroforestry systems and helps them better contribute to financially viable and environmentally sound agricultural operations.\n",
      "ENV 695 Yale Forest Forum Series: Understanding Climate-Smart Forestry in Practice. Gary Dunning, P Mark Ashton. The Forest School at the Yale School of the Environment has developed a new seminar for fall 2023 titled Understanding Climate-Smart Forestry in Practice. This seminar is part of the School’s Series on Forests and Climate. This fall series is co-sponsored by the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF) has become a buzzword across the forestry sector and beyond. However, climate-smart forestry is an often-used phrase without a commonly understood definition. From conservation non-profits to institutional landowners to policymakers wrestling with climate change and its impacts on forests, the focus is on issues related to forest management. In this seminar, we learn from practitioners and researchers about how they put climate-smart forestry into practice. We also learn how forests can be managed to enhance their carbon storage capabilities and/or to increase their resilience to the impacts of climate.\n",
      "ENV 698 Carbon Containment. Anastasia O'Rourke, Dean Takahashi, Michael Oristaglio, Sinead Crotty. There is growing recognition that reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions alone is not sufficient to mitigate catastrophic effects of global climate change. As GHGs accumulate in the atmosphere, it is increasingly important to draw down these emissions cost-effectively in large quantities via carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) techniques–which can be broadly described as \"carbon containment.\" Recognizing the urgency of the problem at hand and the need for private and philanthropic action, many large companies, investors, and donors have stepped up commitments to stabilize the climate and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In addition to decarbonization strategies that reduce emissions, climate leaders are investing in and purchasing credits from negative emission carbon containment projects that reduce atmospheric levels of GHGs. Currently, the options for entities to credibly meet ambitious climate goals using carbon containment approaches are very limited. This goal of this course is to: (1) teach and engage students from a range of disciplines about the existing technologies and markets for carbon containment, (2) investigate nascent or neglected carbon containment mechanisms, and (3) develop case studies highlighting strategies and risks for moving promising pre-commercial ideas from concept to practice.\n",
      "ENV 704 Workshop on Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry with Drones. Xuhui Lee. A workshop that explores the current state and future outlook of remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) for environmental monitoring. UAV-based remote sensing is a rapidly developing field in environmental science and technology. Versatile and inexpensive, it has the potential to offer solutions in a wide range of applications, such as forestry inventory, precision agriculture, flood hazard assessment, pollution monitoring, and land surveys. The class meets once a week for three hours. The workshop is divided into three parts: (1) reviewing the state of the technology on UAV types, sensor configurations, and data acquisition methods; (2) exploring GIS and remote-sensing software tools for analyzing super-high-resolution spectral data acquired by fixed-wing drones; (3) cross-validating drone products against Lidar data and satellite imagery. Students may also have the opportunity to participate in drone flight missions. Data analysis, presentation, literature critique, field trips.\n",

      "ENV 723 Wetlands Ecology, Conservation, and Management. Kealoha Freidenburg. Wetlands are ubiquitous. Collectively they cover 370,000 square miles in the United States and globally encompass more than five million square miles. Most points on a map are less than one kilometer from the nearest wetland. Yet wetlands are nearly invisible to most people. In this course we explore wetlands in all of their dimensions, including the critical services they provide to other systems, the rich biodiversity they harbor, and their impact on global climate. Additionally, wetlands are linchpin environments for scientific policy and regulation. The overarching aim of the course is to connect what we know about wetlands from a scientific perspective to the ways in which wetlands matter for people.\n",
      "ENV 728 Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis in the Environmental Sciences. Jonathan Reuning-Scherer. An introduction to statistics and data analysis with emphasis on practical applications in the environmental sciences.

In a highly interactive format, students evaluate the importance of human-wildlife interactions across diverse ecosystems, exacerbators that influence outcomes, and management interventions that promote coexistence.\n",
      "ENV 750 Writing the World. Verlyn Klinkenborg. This is a practical writing course meant to develop the student’s skills as a writer. But its real subject is perception and the writer’s authority—the relationship between what you notice in the world around you and what, culturally speaking, you are allowed to notice. What you write during the term is driven entirely by your own interest and attention. How you write is the question at hand. We explore the overlapping habitats of language—present and past—and the natural environment. And, to a lesser extent, we explore the character of persuasion in environmental themes. Every member of the class writes every week, and we all read what everyone writes every week. It makes no difference whether you are a would-be journalist, scientist, environmental advocate, or policy maker. The goal is to rework your writing and sharpen your perceptions, both sensory and intellectual. Enrollment limited to fifteen.\n",
      "ENV 753 Regression Modeling of Ecological and Environmental Data. Timothy Gregoire. This course in applied statistics assists scientific researchers in the analysis and interpretation of observational and field data.

      "ENV 761 Negotiating International Agreements: The Case of Climate Change. Susan Biniaz. This class is a practical introduction to the negotiation of international agreements, with a focus on climate change. Through the climate lens, students explore cross-cutting features of international agreements, the process of international negotiations, the development of national positions, advocacy of national positions internationally, and the many ways in which differences among negotiating countries are resolved. The seminar also examines the history and substance of the climate change regime, including, inter alia, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, the 2015 Paris Agreement, and recent developments. There are two mock negotiations.\n",
      "ENV 762 Applied Math for Environmental Studies. Eli Fenichel. The language of mathematics is an important leg in the stool of interdisciplinary research and analysis, and many graduate courses at YSE involve mathematical content. However, many graduate students have not taken a math course in years, and their math skills are rusty. Furthermore, many graduate-level mathematical concepts may be entirely new. Experience suggests that many students either opt out of taking courses they are truly interested in or muddle through, struggle with the math, and miss important concepts. AMES is meant to help students refresh or acquire new math skills and succeed in content and \"toolbox\" graduate-level courses. AMES provides a structured opportunity to learn a range of mathematical concepts used in environmental studies. The course assumes that, at a minimum, students took college algebra and perhaps a semester of calculus (but might not really remember it). Concepts are presented heuristically in a \"how to\" and \"why\" approach with examples from environmental studies. The goal is for students to be conversant and have intuition about (i.e., to demystify) why logs, exponents, derivatives, integrals, linear algebra, probability, optimization, stability analysis, and differential equations show up throughout environmental studies. Students learn (review) how to use these techniques. Also covered is a bit of history of math and an introduction to computer programming.\n",
      "ENV 772 Indigenous Self-Government in the U.S. Constitutional Order. Gerald Torres. Native people in the United States have been building institutions of self-governance in the face of enormous colonial pressure for centuries. This course considers the unique legal positions of Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawai‘ian citizens in the United States as well as the residents of the U.S. territories. The course introduces students to contemporary legal debates and social movements in the U.S. territories, Indian Country, and Hawai‘i and explore how overseas expansionism and relations with Indigenous peoples have shaped U.S. constitutional theory and doctrine. This course demonstrates how the constitutional condition of the U.S. territories, Tribal nations, Alaska villages, and Hawai‘i occupy more than niche legal issues but require us to think more broadly about borders, race, indigeneity, and citizenship in the U.S. We focus on the institutions of self-governance both to illustrate the continued resistance to colonial rule and to highlight the unique constitutional questions U.S. colonial actions have posed from the very beginning.\n",
      "ENV 773 Air Pollution Control. Drew Gentner. An overview of air quality problems worldwide with a focus on emissions, chemistry, transport, and other processes that govern dynamic behavior in the atmosphere.

The course provides students with a comprehensive theoretical and empirical knowledge base about energy systems in the world. This course describes and explains the basics of energy and the laws that govern it, the different components of an energy system (supply technologies, delivery systems, and demand), the institutions that govern the energy sectors, the role of energy in development, its impact on climate change, and an understanding of the key challenges of an energy transition towards a sustainable future. The course has a specific emphasis on electricity systems, how they are operated and governed, and how they have to be transformed to tackle climate change. Students receive a unique exposure to energy issues in the Global South. This course provides students with basic analytical tools and knowledge to formulate and solve energy-related decisions at an individual, national, and global scale and to understand and critique ongoing policy dialogues on energy and climate.\n",
      "ENV 816 Electric Utilities: An Industry in Transition. John Rhodes. The U.S. electric utility industry is a $400 billion business with capital expenditures on the order of $100 billion per year to replace aging infrastructure, implement new technologies, and meet new regulatory requirements. A reliable electricity infrastructure is essential for the U.S. economy and the health and safety of its citizens. The electric industry also has a significant impact on the environment. In the United States, electric power generation is responsible for about 40 percent of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. Electric utilities in the United States are at a crossroads. Technological innovations, improving economics, and regulatory incentives provide a transformational opportunity to implement demand-side resources and distributed energy technologies that will both lower emissions and improve service to customers. Such significant changes could, however, disrupt existing utility business models and therefore may not be fully supported by incumbent utilities. This course focuses on the issues, challenges, risks, and trade-offs associated with moving the U.S. utility industry toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. We explore how utilities are regulated and how economic factors and regulatory policies influence outcomes and opportunities to align customer, environmental, and utility shareholder interests to craft win-win-win solutions.\n",
      "ENV 817 Urban, Suburban, and Regional Planning Practice. David Kooris. Our cities, towns, and regions represent the cumulative impact of planning policies implemented at multiple scales over the past century. This course explores the dynamic trends facing the United States and its communities and the evolution in planning practice that is occurring at the local and regional scale to address them. It looks at both suburban and urban approaches. The recent pandemic, multiple recessions, climate change, and a lack of social cohesion call for a new triple bottom-line approach to decision-making for our future. Existing policies and governance structures are not always well suited for the new challenges and opportunities that we face. Local, state, and the national government are, to varying degrees, crafting new solutions to the challenges of urban and suburban America.\n",
      "ENV 821 Environmental Policy Making: From Local to Global. Luke Sanford. This course focuses on policy making around environmental issues. We explore and analyze institutions at all levels of government, from community management of forests to global management of greenhouse gas emissions. We also explore a variety of environmental case studies. Students learn to examine issues and institutions through the lens of the actors involved, their incentives, and the information they have. The course includes a simulation taking place over multiple weeks at which students negotiate an international environmental agreement.\n",
      "ENV 823 Energy Law and Policy. Don Elliott. This course explores the troubled intersection between energy, environmental, economic and national security policies. We consider a diverse range of regulatory approaches to minimize adverse environmental effects of various forms of energy development. These include emerging issues regarding climate change and promoting renewable energy; hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"); regulation of off-shore drilling and lessons from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; liability for natural resources and other damages from oil spills under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90); the Fukushima, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear accidents; and the role of nuclear energy, if any, going forward. We also cover the basics of utility rate setting and the role of the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency (FERC). We conclude by considering the geopolitical implications of various energy policies. Supervised Analytic Writing or Substantial Paper credit available for three credits, or a shorter seminar paper or self-scheduled essay exam for two credits. Self-scheduled examination or paper option.\n",
      "ENV 835 Seminar on Land Use Planning. Jessica Bacher. Land use control exercised by state and local governments determines where development occurs on the American landscape, the preservation of natural resources, the emission of greenhouse gases, the conservation of energy, and the shape and livability of cities and towns. The exercise of legal authority to plan and regulate the development and conservation of privately owned land plays a key role in meeting the needs of the nation’s growing population for equitable housing, energy, and nonresidential development as well as ensuring that critical environmental functions are protected from the adverse impacts of land development. This course explores the multifaceted discipline of land use and urban planning and their associated ecological implications. Numerous land use strategies are discussed, including identifying and defining climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, including affordable housing, community revitalization, energy development and siting, equitable community engagement, transit-oriented development, building and neighborhood energy conservation, distressed building remediation, jobs and housing balance, coastal resiliency, and biological carbon sequestration. The course also explores how recent events impact these planning issues. The focus is on exposing students to the basics of land use and urban planning, especially in the United States but also internationally, and serving as an introduction for a YSE curricular concentration in land use. Guest speakers are professionals involved in sustainable development, land conservation, smart growth, renewable energy, and climate change management.\n",
      "ENV 836 Agrarian Societies: Culture, Society, History, and Development. Jonathan Wyrtzen, Marcela Echeverri Munoz.

Major analytical perspectives from anthropology, economics, history, political science, and environmental studies are used to develop a meaning-centered and historically grounded account of the transformations of rural society. Team-taught.\n",
      "ENV 839 Power in Conservation. Carol Carpenter. This course examines the anthropology of power, particularly power in conservation interventions in the global South. It is intended to give students a toolbox of ideas about power in order to improve the effectiveness of conservation. Conservation thought and practice are power-laden: conservation thought is powerfully shaped by the history of ideas of nature and its relation to people, and conservation interventions govern and affect peoples and ecologies. This course argues that being able to think deeply, particularly about power, improves conservation policy making and practice. Political ecology is by far the best known and published approach to thinking about power in conservation; this course emphasizes the relatively neglected but robust anthropology of conservation literature outside political ecology, especially literature rooted in Foucault. It is intended to make four of Foucault’s concepts of power accessible, concepts that are the most used in the anthropology of conservation: the power of discourses, discipline and governmentality, subject formation, and neoliberal governmentality. The important ethnographic literature that these concepts have stimulated is also examined. Together, theory and ethnography can underpin our emerging understanding of a new, Anthropocene-shaped world. This course will be of interest to students and scholars of conservation, environmental anthropology, and political ecology, as well as conservation practitioners and policy makers. It is a required course for students in the combined YSE/Anthropology doctoral degree program. It is highly recommended for M.E.Sc. students who need an in-depth course on social science theory. M.E.M. students interested in conservation practice and policy making are also encouraged to consider this course, which makes an effort to bridge the gap between the best academic literature and practice. Open to advanced undergraduates. No prerequisites. Three-hour discussion-centered seminar.\n",
      "ENV 840 Climate Change Policy and Perspectives. Robert Klee. This course examines the scientific, economic, legal, political, institutional, and historic underpinnings of climate change and the related policy challenge of developing the energy system needed to support a prosperous and sustainable modern society. Particular attention is given to analyzing the existing framework of treaties, law, regulations, and policy—and the incentives they have created—which have done little over the past several decades to change the world’s trajectory with regard to the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. What would a twenty-first-century policy framework that is designed to deliver a sustainable energy future and a successful response to climate change look like? How would such a framework address issues of equity? How might incentives be structured to engage the business community and deliver the innovation needed in many domains? While designed as a lecture course, class sessions are highly interactive. Self-scheduled examination.\n",
      "ENV 850 International Organizations and Conferences. Peter Boyd. This course focuses on the historic, present, and future roles of international environmental conferences. Through guest speakers, assigned readings, and discussions, students explore conferences including IUCN’s World Conservation Congress, the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity, UNFCCC’s climate change conference, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Students, along with visiting alumni and guest speakers, discuss the roles and impacts of the various conferences in international environmental decision-making and the future of international conferences in a post-COVID world. The course also assesses the potential for improved equity, justice, and inclusion in international conferences, organizations, and their secretariats. Students attending fall conferences (in person or virtually) develop work plans to be completed during the conference under the guidance of their host delegations and the instructor.\n",
      "ENV 857 Financing Climate Change Adaptation in Developing Countries. Pradeep Kurukulasuriya.

The class entails in-class discussions where students are expected to critically analyze course content, discuss and debate, as well as present material. Enrollment is limited to fifteen.\n",
      "ENV 860 Developing Environmental Policies and Winning Campaigns. Margie Alt. This course is about what makes an environmental policy idea successful—one that can go from concept to law, get implemented well, and achieve its intended goals. In addition, this class covers how to develop and run effective campaigns to win environmental policies. Good policy does not just happen. It takes creative thinking, learning from experience and history, and an ability to \"look around corners\" to help ensure that your idea can actually be well implemented, won’t have unintended consequences, and will actually solve the problem you set out to alleviate. And, once you have a honed policy idea, there is no magic wand that will turn it into the law of the land. Whether in city hall, the state legislature, the U.S. Congress, or a corporate boardroom, many stakeholders will have a hand in determining whether an idea turns into a law.\n",
      "ENV 878 Climate and Society: Past to Present. Michael Dove. Seminar on the major traditions of thought and debate regarding climate, climate change, and society, drawing largely on the social sciences and humanities. Section I, overview of the course. Section II, disaster: the social origins of disastrous events; and the attribution of societal \"collapse\" to extreme climatic events. Section III, causality: the revelatory character of climatic perturbation; politics and the history of efforts to control weather/climate; and nineteenth–twentieth-century theories of environmental determinism. Section IV, history and culture: the ancient tradition of explaining differences among people in terms of differences in climate; and cross-cultural differences in views of climate.  Section V, knowledge: the study of folk knowledge of climate; and local views of climatic perturbation and change. Section VI, politics: knowledge, humor, and symbolism in North-South climate debates. The goal of the course is to examine the embedded historical, cultural, and political drivers of current climate change debates and discourses. This course can be applied towards Yale College distributional requirements in Social Science and Writing. The course is open to both graduate and undergraduate students. Enrollment capped.\n",
      "ENV 894 Green Building: Issues and Perspectives. Melissa Kops. Buildings have an outsized impact on human and environmental health. The building sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions globally, responsible for almost 40 percent of total emissions. Construction and demolition activities generated 600 million tons of waste in 2018 in the United States, more than twice what was generated in municipal solid waste. Buildings represent an enormous opportunity to reduce environmental impact, and the movement that represents this approach is commonly called green building. But green building is broad and deep—involving process, products, and policy—and crisscrosses many disciplines. This course examines green building from a variety of perspectives, placing it in a technical, social, financial, and historical context. The task of reducing the environmental impact of our buildings requires cross-disciplinary integration and touches nearly every aspect of our lives as occupants and managers of interior spaces. Individual topics in green building—such as building science, indoor environmental quality, innovative finance, and public- and private-sector programs—are covered through research, class discussion, guest lectures, field trips, and group projects. Great emphasis is placed on the practical challenges and opportunities that green building presents to building and non-building professionals working together to design, specify, construct, operate, renovate, and finance our nation’s buildings. Enrollment limited to fifteen.\n",

      "ENV 962 Tribal Resources and Sovereignty-Clinic. Patrick Gonzales-Rogers. Understanding Tribal Resource Management: we identify and describe the varieties of tribal resources and the limitation of the management prerogatives facing Tribal Nations under the current legal regime. We explore those resources governed by the trust duty and the federal government’s role. We also look at the emerging resources in the green economy and investigate the relations between tribes, states, and private actors. Co-management, the trust duty, and tribal sovereignty are the main themes around which the clinic is structured. Application required.\n",
      "ENV 974 Social Innovation Starter. Teresa Chahine. In this course based at Jackson School of Global Affairs, students apply the ten stage framework of the textbook Social Entrepreneurship: Building Impact Step by Step to innovate new solutions for host organizations. Host organizations are social enterprises or other social purpose organizations based globally and locally who present Yale students with a problem statement to work on over the course of one term. This could include creating new programs or products, reaching new populations, measuring the impact of existing work, creating new communications tools for existing work, or other challenges. Students gain social innovation and entrepreneurship experience and host organizations benefit from students’ problem solving. Students from all programs and concentrations at Yale are welcome to join Jackson students in forming inter-disciplinary teams to tackle social challenges. This course runs during the same time as Social Entrepreneurship Lab. The key distinction is that in that lab, students pick their own topic to research and ideate on, whereas in this course students work on projects for host organizations. Jackson students may elect to follow up on this course with a summer internship to the host organization, to help support implementation of their solution, if the host organization and the School administration accepts their application.\n",

      "EP&E 214 Classics of Ethics, Politics and Economics. Kevin Elliott. This course is designed to explore the moral and theoretical foundations, critiques, and open questions surrounding the social organization of production and governance in modern societies. A key aim of this class is to better understand the moral and philosophical background of market-based distribution, criticisms of it, and how thinkers have tried to make sense of it.\n",
      "EP&E 217 Classics of EP&E–Intellectual Origins of Liberalism and Conservatism. Gregory Collins. The purpose of this course is to explore the intellectual origins of liberalism and conservatism through an EP&E framework. We discuss the tensions between collective wisdom and individual reason in the early modern period and survey the thought of thinkers in the proto-liberal and proto-conservative traditions, such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke on sovereignty, individual autonomy, reason, and toleration; and Robert Filmer, Richard Hooker, and David Hume on order, custom, and utility. Our main object of inquiry, however, is the intellectual division that emerged between supporters and critics of the French Revolution, the historical event that prompted the modern political identities of liberalism and conservatism. Accordingly, we examine the political, moral, and economic theories of the Revolution; reactions to the Revolution from Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, and other counterrevolutionaries; critical responses to their reactions, including those from Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, and James Mackintosh; and the impact of this debate on the evolution of liberalism and conservatism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Europe and the United States. Class discussions and readings confront liberal and conservative perspectives on human nature; reason; freedom; tradition; individual rights; religion; the Enlightenment; market economies; democratic participation; and equality.\n",
      "EP&E 223 Tradition and Modernity: Ethics, Religion, Politics, Law, & Culture. Andrew Forsyth. This seminar is about \"tradition\"—what it is and what it does—and how reflecting on tradition can help us better understand ethics, religion, politics, law, and culture. We ask: for whom and in what ways (if any) are the beliefs and practices transmitted from one generation to another persuasive or even authoritative? And how do appeals to tradition work today? We traverse a series of cases studies in different domains. Looking to ethics, we ask if rational argument means rejecting or inhabiting tradition. Next, we look at religions as traditions and traditions as one source of authority within religions. We consider appeals to tradition in conservative and progressive politics. And how the law uses decisions on past events to guide present actions. Finally, we turn to tradition in civic and popular culture with attention to \"invented traditions,\" the May 2023 British Coronation, and Beyoncé’s 2019 concert film \"Homecoming.\"\n",
      "EP&E 239 Political Representation. Amir Fairdosi. The notion of political representation lies at the center of government in the United States and much of the rest of the world. In this course, we examine the features of political representation, both in theory and practice. We ask (and possibly find ourselves struggling to answer!) such questions as: What is political representation? Should we have a representative system as opposed to something else like monarchy or direct democracy? Should representatives demographically resemble those they represent, or is that not necessary? How do things like congressional redistricting, electoral competition, and term limits affect the quality of representation? Do constituents’ preferences actually translate into policy in the United States, and if so, how? In Part I of this course, we discuss the theoretical foundations upon which representative government rests. In Part II, we move beyond theories of representation and on to the way political representation actually operates in the United States. In Part III, we move beyond the ways in which representation works and focus instead on some ways in which it doesn’t work. Proposed solutions are also explored.\n",
      "EP&E 241 Religion and Politics in the World. A broad overview of the relationship between religion and politics around the world, especially Christianity and Islam. Religions are considered to constitute not just theologies but also sets of institutions, networks, interests, and sub-cultures. The course’s principal aim is to understand how religion affects politics as an empirical matter, rather than to explore moral dimensions of this relationship.\n",
      "EP&E 242 Politics and Markets. Peter Swenson. Examination of the interplay between market and political processes in different substantive realms, time periods, and countries. Inquiry into the developmental relationship between capitalism and democracy and the functional relationships between the two.

Topics include the economic motives of interest groups and coalitions in the political process.\n",
      "EP&E 246 Participatory Democracy. Amir Fairdosi. What does democracy look like without elections? In this class, we discuss the theory and practice of \"participatory\" forms of democracy (i.e. those that allow and encourage citizens to influence policy directly, rather than indirectly through elected representatives).\n",
      "EP&E 247 Digital War. From drones and autonomous robots to algorithmic warfare, virtual war gaming, and data mining, digital war has become a key pressing issue of our times and an emerging field of study. This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.\n",
      "EP&E 250 The European Union. David Cameron.

A study of three major episodes in modern African history characterized by ambitious projects of bureaucratically driven change—apartheid and its aftermath, Rwanda’s genocide and post-genocide reconstruction, and Ethiopia’s revolution and its long aftermath. Examination of Weber’s theory bureaucracy, Scott’s thesis on high modernism, Bierschenk’s attempts to place African states in global bureaucratic history. Overarching theme is the place of bureaucratic ambitions and capacities in shaping African trajectories.\n",
      "EP&E 306 First Amendment and Ethics of Law. Karen Goodrow. This course addresses the First Amendment and freedom of speech, focusing on the ethical implications of restrictions on free speech, as well as the exercise of free speech. Course topics and discussions include the \"fighting words\" doctrine, hate speech, true threats, content regulated speech, freedom of speech and the internet, and the so-called \"right to be forgotten.\" By the end of the course, students recognize the role free speech plays in society, including its negative and positive impacts on various segments of society. Students also have an understanding of the competing interests arising from the First Amendment’s right to free speech, and can analyze how these competing interests are weighed and measured in the United States as compared with other countries.\n",
      "EP&E 313 Economic Analysis of Law. Robin Landis. This course is intended to provide an introduction to the economic analysis of law.

      "EP&E 328 YData: Data Science for Political Campaigns. Joshua Kalla. Political campaigns have become increasingly data driven. Data science is used to inform where campaigns compete, which messages they use, how they deliver them, and among which voters. In this course, we explore how data science is being used to design winning campaigns. Students gain an understanding of what data is available to campaigns, how campaigns use this data to identify supporters, and the use of experiments in campaigns. This course provides students with an introduction to political campaigns, an introduction to data science tools necessary for studying politics, and opportunities to practice the data science skills presented in S&DS 123, YData.\n",
      "EP&E 334 Normative Ethics. Shelly Kagan. A systematic examination of normative ethics, the part of moral philosophy that attempts to articulate and defend the basic principles of morality. The course surveys and explores some of the main normative factors relevant in determining the moral status of a given act or policy (features that help make a given act right or wrong). Brief consideration of some of the main views about the foundations of normative ethics (the ultimate basis or ground for the various moral principles).\n",
      "EP&E 350 Pandemics in Africa: From the Spanish Influenza to Covid-19. Jonny Steinberg. The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.\n",
      "EP&E 356 Constitutional Law and Business Ethics. Gregory Collins. The purpose of this course is to explore how the U.S. Constitution and Supreme Court case law have had an impact on business and commercial activities throughout U.S. history. We first identify provisions of the Constitution that relate to economics and familiarize ourselves with methods of constitutional interpretation, including originalism and living constitutionalism. We then apply this guiding framework to our analysis of key Supreme Court cases that have addressed the Commerce Clause, the Takings Clause, the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and a number of other constitutional provisions that relate to commercial exchange and the legal status of corporations. Additional concepts we discuss include the countermajoritarian difficulty, the rational basis test, strict scrutiny, substantive due process, fundamental rights, disparate impact, public accommodations law, antidiscrimination law, and antitrust law. The guiding question we confront is whether the courts should a.) defer to legislatures in regulating business actors; or b.) overturn democratically enacted laws to protect the economic liberties of individuals.\n",

      "EP&E 399 Platforms and Cultural Production. Platforms—digital infrastructures that serve as intermediaries between end-users and complementors—have emerged in various cultural and economic settings, from social media (Instagram), and video streaming (YouTube), to digital labor (Uber), and e-commerce (Amazon). This seminar provides a multidisciplinary lens to study platforms as hybrids of firms and multi-sided markets with unique history, governance, and infrastructures. The thematic sessions of this course discuss how platforms have transformed cultural production and connectivity, labor, creativity, and democracy by focusing on comparative cases from the United States and abroad. The seminar provides a space for broader discussions on contemporary capitalism and cultural production around topics such as inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and ethics. Students are encouraged to bring examples and case studies from their personal experiences.\n",

      "EP&E 403 Designing and Reforming Democracy. David Froomkin, Ian Shapiro. What is the best electoral system? Should countries try to limit the number of political parties? Should chief executives be independently elected? Should legislatures have powerful upper chambers? Should courts have the power to strike down democratically enacted laws? These and related questions are taken up in this course. Throughout the semester, we engage in an ongoing dialogue with the Federalist Papers, contrasting the Madisonian constitutional vision with subsequent insights from democratic theory and empirical political science across the democratic world. Where existing practices deviate from what would be best, we also attend to the costs of these sub-optimal systems and types of reforms that would improve them.\n",

What would a satisfying answer look like? This class comprises a geographical and historical survey of the world’s languages and attends to how languages can differ from one another. According to UNESCO, more than half of world languages (virtually all of which are spoken by indigenous communities) will have gone extinct by the end of the century. We interrogate notions like language endangerment, shift and death, and we consider the threats that these pose to global linguistic diversity. There is a striking correlation between the geographic distribution of linguistic and biological diversity, although proportionally, far more languages are endangered than biological species; the question of how (and why? and whether?) to respond to that situation is a matter of serious import for the 21st Century. This course surveys the various ways in which the world’s linguistic diversity and language ecologies can be assessed—and discusses the serious threats to that diversity, why this might be a matter of concern, and the principle of linguistic human rights. Students have the opportunity to investigate a minority language in some depth and report on its status with respect to the range of issues discussed in class.\n",

      "ER&M 258 Wilderness in the North American Imagination: Landscapes of the US Nuclear-Industrial Complex. Charlotte Hecht. Since the mid-twentieth century, the drive for nuclear power—in the form of weapons and energy—has irreversibly shaped the landscapes of the North American continent, and the world. The activities of the nuclear fuel cycle (uranium mining and milling, weapons testing and production, and radioactive waste dumping) have reached every state in the country, often in devastating and uneven ways. Today, debates about nuclear weapons and the benefits of nuclear power are at the forefront of contemporary discourse. This course contextualizes these impacts and debates in the long history of post-war industrialization and militarization, a history that begins with 19th century settler-colonial conceptions of \"wilderness.\" Throughout the course, we investigate how cultural imaginaries of wilderness (and ideas about nature, landscape, space, and environment) are deeply related to the uneven geographies of the nuclear industrial complex, and the intersections of US imperialism, militarism, extractive capitalism, and environmental racism. Alongside this, we consider how artists, activists, and scholars are working to theorize, reframe, and reimagine the legacies of the nuclear industry.\n",
      "ER&M 277 Introduction to Critical Border Studies. Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen. This course serves as an introduction into the major themes and approaches to the study of border enforcement and the management of human mobility. We draw upon a diverse range of scholarship across the social sciences as well as history, architecture, and philosophy to better understand how we find ourselves in this present \"age of walls\" (Tim Marshall 2019). In addition, we take a comparative approach to the study of borders—examining specific contemporary and historical cases across the world in order to gain a comprehensive view of what borders are and how their meaning and function has changed over time. And because there is \"critical\" in the title, we explicitly evaluate the political consequences of borders, examine the sorts of resistances mobilized against them, and ask what alternative social and political worlds might be possible.\n",
      "ER&M 278 Borders & Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures. Luna Najera. The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization? \n",

      "ER&M 285 Latin American Immigration to the United States: Past, Present, and Future. Angel Escamilla Garcia. Immigration from Latin America is the one of the most important and controversial issues in the United States today. The family separation crisis, the infamous border wall, and the Dream Act dominate political debate. Latinos—numbering more than 60 million in the U.S.—are a large, heterogeneous, and growing group with a unique social, political, and cultural history. This course explores key current issues in immigration, as well as the history of Latin American migration to the U.S., with the aim of providing students the tools necessary to thoughtfully participate in current debates.\n",

We pay particular attention to the keywords \"trans,\" \"queer,\" \"Chicanx,\" and \"Latinx\" by placing them in productive tension with each other through varied critical genealogies.\n",
      "ER&M 287 Reading Environments: Nature, Culture, and Agency. Luna Najera. Extreme weather, proliferation of species extinctions, climate migration, and the outbreak of pandemics can all be understood as instances of koyaanisqatsi, the Hopi word for life out of balance. They may also be viewed as indications that we are living in the age of the Anthropocene, a term in the natural and social sciences that acknowledges that human activities have had a radical geological impact on the planet since the onset of the Industrial revolution. In this course we study relations between humans and other-than-humans to understand how we arrived at a life out of balance. We inquire into how binary distinctions between nature and culture are made, sustained, or questioned through a diversity of meaning-making practices in Spanish, Latin American, and indigenous literature, visual culture, and material culture. The indigenous artifacts studied include Popol Vuh, poetry, petroglyphs, and documentaries by indigenous people of the Amazon, which provide opportunities for asking pressing questions: To what extent does the nature and culture binary foreclose alternative possibilities for imagining ourselves and our relation to the world? Are there ways of perceiving our world and ourselves that bypass such binaries and if so, what are they? In the final weeks of the course, we draw from our insights to investigate where the nature/culture binary figures in present discussions of environmental catastrophes and rights of nature movements in Latin America. Taught in Spanish.\n",
      "ER&M 289 Writing American Studies: Food as Story & Critical Lens. Alison Kibbe. This writing seminar examines food as an entry to the interdisciplinary approaches of American Studies. We explore how food can help us think critically about our world, as well as how we can write critically about food. Food serves as a useful entry point to interdisciplinary American and Ethnic Studies because centering food requires that we think across history, cultural studies, anthropology, science, ecology, aesthetics, embodiment, and more. Through food studies we gain a unique understanding of the peoples, cultures, plants, animals, mobilities, and flavors that shape societies, communities, and individuals. With a focus on Caribbean, Black, Latinx, and indigenous perspectives, we use critical food studies to examine questions about place, history, racial formations, migration, and above all, different approaches to writing, drafting, editing, and re-writing.\n",

Platforms—digital infrastructures that serve as intermediaries between end-users and complementors—have emerged in various cultural and economic settings, from social media (Instagram), and video streaming (YouTube), to digital labor (Uber), and e-commerce (Amazon). This seminar provides a multidisciplinary lens to study platforms as hybrids of firms and multi-sided markets with unique history, governance, and infrastructures. The thematic sessions of this course discuss how platforms have transformed cultural production and connectivity, labor, creativity, and democracy by focusing on comparative cases from the United States and abroad. The seminar provides a space for broader discussions on contemporary capitalism and cultural production around topics such as inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and ethics. Students are encouraged to bring examples and case studies from their personal experiences.\n",

      "ER&M 304 Indigenous Politics Today. This seminar examines Indigenous politics in our current moment. Movements for Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination, often forged in solidarity with other Indigenous communities, as well as Black people, brown people, and settlers, engage urgently with the tensions–and promises–that underpin theories of political power, sovereignty, territoriality, dispossession, and cultural identity. Readings for this course hedge closely to Native North America before extending comparatively to Oceania, Palestine, and South America in order to think broadly about the effects of globalization and neoliberalism; climate change and environmental racism; and extractive regimes and racial capitalism upon Indigenous communities around the world. This material, then, helps us to envision the kinds of decolonial futures proposed by the activists, scholars, and artists encountered in this course.\n",

      "ER&M 309 Traditional Medicine, Science, and the Politics of Healing in the Americas. Ximena Lopez Carrillo. This course examines the history of traditional medicines, the popular attitudes toward them, and the politics of healing after the emergence of modern medicine in the Americas. By reading historical accounts of different healing traditions, students observe how different healing traditions propose different ways to understand the world and learn to situate the history of traditional and complementary medicine within larger fields of inquiry such as the history of science in the Americas, medical anthropology, migration, and cultural history. Additionally, students read about contemporary issues and debates surrounding traditional medicine such as health autonomy, health disparities, medical pluralism, globalization, and proposals for the decolonization of American healthcare. The class readings include topics such as indigenous medicine, curanderismo, yoga, acupuncture, and santería.\n",
      "ER&M 316 Indigenous Food Sovereignty. Hi'ilei Hobart. What does it mean to be food sovereign? Are contemporary American diets colonial? This course takes a comparative approach to understanding how and why food is a central component of contemporary sovereignty discourse. More than just a question of eating, Indigenous foodways offer important critiques of, and interventions to, the settler state: food connects environment, community, public health, colonial histories, and economics. Students theorize these connections by reading key works from across the fields of critical indigenous studies, food studies, philosophy, history, and anthropology. In doing so, we question the potentialities of enacting food sovereignty within the settler state, whether dietary decolonization is possible in the so-called age of the Anthropocene, and the limits of working within and against today’s legacies of the colonial food system.\n",
      "ER&M 319 Drama in Diaspora: South Asian American Theater and Performance. Shilarna Stokes. South Asian Americans have appeared on U.S. stages since the late nineteenth century, yet only in the last quarter century have plays and performances by South Asian Americans begun to dismantle dominant cultural representations of South Asian and South Asian American communities and to imagine new ways of belonging. This seminar introduces you to contemporary works of performance (plays, stand-up sets, multimedia events) written and created by U.S.-based artists of South Asian descent as well as artists of the South Asian diaspora whose works have had an impact on U.S. audiences. With awareness that the South Asian American diaspora comprises multiple, contested, and contingent identities, we investigate how artists have worked to manifest complex representations of South Asian Americans onstage, challenge institutional and professional norms, and navigate the perils and pleasures of becoming visible. No prior experience with or study of theater/performance required. Students in all years and majors welcome.\n",
      "ER&M 322 Comparative Colonialisms. Lisa Lowe. In this interdisciplinary seminar, students examine several historical and ongoing modes of colonialism—settler colonialism, slavery, and overseas empire, as well as their various contestations—approaching the study through readings in history, anthropology, political economy, literature, arts, and other materials. We discuss questions such as: In what ways are settler colonialism, slavery, and empire independent, and in what ways do they articulate with one another? How have colonialisms been integral to the emergence of the modern U.S. nation-state and economy? How does one read the national archive and engage the epistemology of evidence? What are the roles of cultural practices, narrative, and visual arts in countering colonial power?\n",

Examination of the diverse historical and contemporary experiences of people from East, South, and Southeast Asian ancestry living in the Americas, Australia, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Organized thematically and comparative in scope, topics include labor migrations, community formations, chain migrations, transnational connections, intergenerational dynamics, interracial and ethnic relations, popular cultures, and return migrations.\n",
      "ER&M 330 Digital War. From drones and autonomous robots to algorithmic warfare, virtual war gaming, and data mining, digital war has become a key pressing issue of our times and an emerging field of study. This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.\n",
      "ER&M 335 Social Mobility and Migration. Morgane Cadieu. The seminar examines the representation of upward mobility, social demotion, and interclass encounters in contemporary French literature and cinema, with an emphasis on the interaction between social class and literary style. Topics include emancipation and determinism; inequality, precarity, and class struggle; social mobility and migration; the intersectionality of class, race, gender, and sexuality; labor and the workplace; homecomings; mixed couples; and adoption. Works by Nobel Prize winner Annie Ernaux and her peers (Éribon, Gay, Harchi, Linhart, Louis, NDiaye, Taïa). Films by Cantet, Chou, and Diop. Theoretical excerpts by Berlant, Bourdieu, and Rancière. Students will have the option to put the French corpus in dialogue with the literature of other countries. Conducted in French.\n",
      "ER&M 344 Informal Cities. Leigh-Anna Hidalgo. The informal sector is an integral and growing part of major global cities. With a special focus on the context of U.S. cities, students examine where a burgeoning informality is visible in the region’s everyday life. How planners and policymakers address informality is an important social justice challenge. But what is the informal sector, or urban informality, or the informal city? This class addresses such questions through a rigorous examination of the growing body of literature from Sociology, Latinx Studies, Urban Planning, and Geography. We reflect on the debates and theories in the study of informality in the U.S. and beyond and gain an understanding of the prevalence, characteristics, rationale, advantages and disadvantages, and socio-spatial implications of informal cities. More specifically, we examine urban informality in work—examining street vendors, sex workers, and waste pickers—as well as housing, and the built environment.\n",
      "ER&M 346 Critical Reading Methods in Indigenous Literatures. Tarren Andrews. This course focuses on developing critical readings skills grounded in the embodied and place-based reading practices encouraged by Indigenous literatures. Students are expected to think critically about their reading practices and environments to consciously cultivate place-based reading strategies across a variety of genres including: fiction and non-fiction, sci-fi, poetry, comic books, criticism, theory, film, and other new media. Students are required to keep a reading journal and regularly present critical reflections on their reading process, as well as engage in group annotations of primary and secondary reading materials.\n",
      "ER&M 352 Writing Creative Ethnographies: Exploring Movement, Poetics, and Collaboration. Jill Tan. Students in this seminar on creative ethnographic writing and experimental research design explore and represent anthropological insight beyond academic argumentation—through movement, art, poetics, and collaborative writing. Course readings and media focus on migration, colonialisms, and anti-blackness, situating anthropology’s disciplinary epistemologies, empirics, ethics in integral relation to an understanding its limits, collaborative potentialities, and multimodal methods. Students need not have a background in anthropology; they should however come with a curiosity about working with creative methods and ethnography—a set of practices to render and understand local forms of everyday life as imbricated with global forces.\n",
      "ER&M 356 Latina/x/e Feminism. Deb Vargas. The course introduces students to Latina/x/e feminist theories. We focus on historical and contemporary writings by and about Chicana, Puerto Rican, Central American, and other Latina/x/e feminist writers and activists. The course draws from interdisciplinary scholarship addressing the intellectual landscape of Latina/x/e and critical race feminist theories and social movement activist organizing. While this course approaches Latina/x/e feminist theories and activism as often having emerged in relation to U.S. nation-making projects we will consider this work with the understanding that projects of Latina/x/e feminism should be understood as cross-border, transnational, and multi-scaler critiques of nation-state violence.\n",
      "ER&M 357 \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy:\" Paranoia and Conspiracy Theories in 20th and 21st C. America. In this course we examine the development and growth of conspiracy theories in American politics and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We look at texts from a variety of different analytical and political traditions to develop an understanding of how and why conspiracy theories develop, their structural dynamics, and how they function as a narrative. We examine a variety of different conspiracy theories and conspiratorial groups from across the political spectrum, but we pay particular attention to anti-Semitism as a foundational form of conspiracy theorizing, as well as the particular role of conspiracy theories in far-right politics, ranging from the John Birch Society in the 1960s to the Tea Party, QAnon, and beyond in the 21st century. We also look at how real conspiracies shape and reinforce conspiracy theorizing as a mode of thought, and formulate ethical answers on how to address conspiracy as a mode of politics.\n",
      "ER&M 359 Gender and the State in Latin America and the Caribbean. Anne Eller. This seminar offers an introduction to historical constructions of gender identity and gendered polities in Latin America and the Caribbean from pre-colonial native societies into the twentieth century. We begin with an analysis of gender in the Inca empire and several lowland societies, focusing on spirituality, agriculture, and land tenure particularly. The arrival of Spanish colonialism brings tremendous and complex transformations to the societies that we consider; we analyze discourses of honor, as well as how various subjects navigated the violence and the transforming colonial state. Our readings turn to Caribbean slavery, where studies of gendered experiences of enslavement and resistance have grown considerably in recent decades. Building on these insights, we analyze the gendered experiences of abolition and inclusion into contentious new Latin American and Caribbean nations of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, we consider some of the most salient analyses of the growth of state power, including dictatorships, in multiple sites. Throughout we maintain an eye for principle questions about representation, reproduction, inclusion, political consciousness, sexuality, migration, kinship, and revolutionary struggle through a gendered lens.\n",
      "ER&M 362 Translation: Theory, Methods, and Practice. David Francis. This course explores the challenges, theories, and pitfalls of translation, focusing on the ways in which acts of translation cross, create, or redefine (socio-)linguistic, national, cultural, and political borders. Special attention is paid to questions of race, economics, gender, sexuality, nationality, post-nationality, multilingualism, citizenship, exile, and their various intersections at the site of literary translation. As part of their final projects, students select and translate a short literary or visual-literary work or critique and re-translate a previously translated literary and/or visual text. Proficiency in a second language is not required. This course meets the methods requirement for the ER&M major.\n",
      "ER&M 364 Ethnicity, Nationalism, and the Politics of Knowledge in Latin America. Marcela Echeverri Munoz. Examination of ethnicity and nationalism in Latin America through the political lens of social knowledge. Comparative analysis of the evolution of symbolic, economic, and political perspectives on indigenous peoples, peasants, and people of African descent from the nineteenth century to the present.

      "ER&M 378 Material Histories of Photography. Jennifer Raab, Paul Messier. While we often see photographs mediated through screens, they are singular objects with specific material histories. Through Yale’s collections, this course explores these histories from the nineteenth century to the present and how they intersect with constructions of class, race, gender, and the non-human world; the ongoing processes of settler-colonialism; and both modern environmental conservation and ecological crisis.\n",
      "ER&M 379 Indigenous Cultures in a Global Context. Diana Onco-Ingyadet. This course explores and examine the cultural production of Indigenous peoples from Australia, South America, Africa, and North America through examination of music, art, entrepreneurship, podcasts, and other forms of expression with attention to their Indigenous identities and the discourses around modernity. Indigenous studies is dominated by historical approaches. While histories of Indigenous peoples are important, the contemporary practices, narratives, and politics of Indigenous peoples also deserve our critical attention. In an effort to illuminate Indigenous peoples experiences and forms of expression and grappling with both tradition and modernity, students examine the ways in which Indigenous peoples around the world come at the same questions, challenges, and debates from their local, specific contexts.\n",
      "ER&M 380 New Developments in Global African Diaspora Studies. Fatima El-Tayeb. This course traces recent developments in African Diaspora Theory, among them Afropessimism, Queer of Color Critique, Black Trans Studies and Afropolitanism. We pay particular attention to interactions between theory, art, and activism. The scope is transnational with a focus on, but not restricted to, the Anglophone DiasporaTexts. Each session roughly follows this structure: One theoretical text representing a recent development in African diaspora studies, one earlier key text that the reading builds on, one theoretical text that does not necessarily fall under the category of diaspora studies but speaks to our topic and one text that relates to the topic but uses a non-theoretical format. Students are expected to develop their own thematically related project over the course of the semester.\n",
      "ER&M 383 Central Americans in the U.S.. Leigh-Anna Hidalgo. This course is an interdisciplinary survey of the social, historical, political, economic, educational, and cultural experiences of Central American immigrants and their children in the United States. The primary objective of the course is to introduce students to several contemporary experiences and issues in the U.S. Central American community. Focusing mostly on Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran immigrants—the three largest groups in the United States—we explore the social structures that constrain individuals as well as the strategies and behaviors immigrants and their communities have taken to establish their presence and make a home in U.S. society and stay connected to their countries of origin. Students gain a critical understanding of Central American identities, particularly as these have been constructed through the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and legal status.\n",
      "ER&M 391 Eugenics and its Afterlives. Daniel HoSang. This course examines the influence of Eugenics research, logics, and ideas across nearly every academic discipline in the 20th century, and the particular masks, tropes, and concepts that have been used to occlude attentions to these legacies today. Students make special use of the large collection of archives held within Yale Special Collections of key figures in the American Eugenics Society. Students work collaboratively to identify alternative research practices and approaches deployed in scholarly and creative works that make racial power visible and enable the production of knowledge unburdened by the legacies of Eugenics and racial science.\n",

      "ER&M 406 Latinx Communities and Education in the United States. This course is an interdisciplinary and comparative study of Latinx communities and their experiences with K-12 education in the United States. The Latinx population in the United States continues to grow, with the Census Bureau projecting that the Latinx population will comprise 27.5 percent of the nation’s population by 2060.[1] In fact, in 2018, more than a quarter of the nation’s newborns were Latinx.[2] Yet, even as the Latinx population continues to grow, the education field has a relatively broad understanding of Latinx communities in the United States–frequently treating them as a monolith when designing everything from curriculum to education reform policies. To understand why such an approach to education studies may yield limited insight on Latinx communities, the course draws on research about the broader histories and experiences of Latinx communities in the United States before returning to the topic of K-12 education.\n",
      "ER&M 409 Latinx Ethnography. Ana Ramos-Zayas. Consideration of ethnography within the genealogy and intellectual traditions of Latinx Studies.

Mastery of these skills is honed through in-depth discussion and weekly writing assignments.\n",
      "ER&M 432 Muslims in the United States. Zareena Grewal. Since 9/11, cases of what has been termed \"home-grown terrorism\" have cemented the fear that \"bad\" Islam is not just something that exists far away, in distant lands. As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation. Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others. By focusing on a range of communities-in-motion and a diverse set of cultural texts, students explore the ways mobility, loss, and communal identity are conceptualized by immigrants, expatriates, refugees, guest-workers, religious seekers, and exiles. To this end, we read histories, ethnographies, essays, policy papers, novels, poetry, memoirs; we watch documentary and fictional films; we listen to music, speeches, spoken word performances, and prayers. Our aim is to deepen our understanding of the multiple meanings and conceptual limits of homeland and diaspora for Muslims in America, particularly in the Age of Terror.\n",

This seminar explores the pedagogical and conceptual tools, resources and frameworks used to teach about race and racism at the primary and secondary levels, across diverse disciplines and subject areas. Moving beyond the more limited paradigms of racial colorblindness and diversity, the seminar introduces curricular strategies for centering race and racism in ways that are accessible to students from a broad range of backgrounds, and that work to advance the overall goals of the curriculum.\n",
      "ER&M 439 Fruits of Empire. Gary Okihiro. Readings, discussions, and research on imperialism and \"green gold\" and their consequences for the imperial powers and their colonies and neo-colonies. Spatially conceived as a world-system that enmeshes the planet and as earth's latitudes that divide the temperate from the tropical zones, imperialism as discourse and material relations is this seminar's focus together with its implantations—an empire of plants. Vast plantations of sugar, cotton, tea, coffee, bananas, and pineapples occupy land cultivated by native and migrant workers, and their fruits move from the tropical to the temperate zones, impoverishing the periphery while profiting the core. Fruits of Empire, thus, implicates power and the social formation of race, gender, sexuality, class, and nation.\n",
      "ER&M 452 Mobility, Race, and U.S. Settler Colonialism. Laura Barraclough. This research seminar explores the significance of movement in the making of settler colonial nation-states, as well as contemporary public history projects that interpret those histories of mobility. To do so, it brings together the fields of settler colonial studies, critical Indigenous studies, ethnic studies, public history, and mobility studies. After acquainting ourselves with key debates within each of these fields, we examine case studies from various regions of the settler United States and diverse Indigenous nations. Our goal is to deepen awareness of the complex ways that movements–voluntary and forced, and by settlers, Natives, migrants, and people of color–are reproduced and remembered (or not) in public memory, and how these memories reproduce or destabilize settler colonialism’s social and cultural structures.\n",
      "ER&M 467 Racial Republic: African Diasporic Literature and Culture in Postcolonial France. Fadila Habchi. This is an interdisciplinary seminar on French cultural history from the 1930s to the present. We focus on issues concerning race and gender in the context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and migration. The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness. Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.\n",

      "ER&M 677 Black Iberia: Then and Now. Nicholas Jones. This graduate seminar examines the variety of artistic, cultural, historical, and literary representations of black Africans and their descendants—both enslaved and free—across the vast stretches of the Luso-Hispanic world and the United States. Taking a chronological frame, the course begins its study of Blackness in medieval and early modern Iberia and its colonial kingdoms. From there, we examine the status of Blackness conceptually and ideologically in Asia, the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. Toward the end of the semester, we concentrate on black Africans by focusing on Equatorial Guinea, sub-Saharan African immigration in present-day Portugal and Spain, and the politics of Afro-Latinx culture and its identity politics in the United States. Throughout the term, we interrogate the following topics in order to guide our class discussions and readings: bondage and enslavement, fugitivity and maroonage, animal imageries and human-animal studies, geography and maps, Black Feminism and Black Queer Studies, material and visual cultures (e.g., beauty ads, clothing, cosmetics, food, Blackface performance, royal portraiture, reality TV, and music videos), the Inquisition and African diasporic religions, and dispossession and immigration. Our challenging task remains the following: to see how Blackness conceptually and experientially is subversively fluid and performative, yet deceptive and paradoxical. This course will be taught in English, with all materials available in the original (English, Portuguese, Spanish) and in English translation.\n",
      "ER&M 696 Michel Foucault I: The Works, The Interlocutors, The Critics. This graduate-level course presents students with the opportunity to develop a thorough, extensive, and deep (though still not exhaustive!) understanding of the oeuvre of Michel Foucault, and his impact on late-twentieth-century criticism and intellectual history in the United States. Non-francophone and/or U.S. American scholars, as Lynne Huffer has argued, have engaged Foucault’s work unevenly and frequently in a piecemeal way, due to a combination of the overemphasis on The History of Sexuality, Vol 1 (to the exclusion of most of his other major works), and the lack of availability of English translations of most of his writings until the early twenty-first century. This course seeks to correct that trend and to re-introduce Foucault’s works to a generation of graduate students who, on the whole, do not have extensive experience with his oeuvre. In this course, we read almost all of Foucault’s published writings that have been translated into English (which is almost all of them, at this point). We read all of the monographs, and all of the Collège de France lectures, in chronological order. This lightens the reading load; we read a book per week, but the lectures are shorter and generally less dense than the monographs. [The benefit of a single author course is that the more time one spends reading Foucault’s work, the easier reading his work becomes.] We read as many of the essays he published in popular and more widely-circulated media as we can. The goal of the course is to give students both breadth and depth in their understanding of Foucault and his works, and to be able to situate his thinking in relation to the intellectual, social, and political histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Alongside Foucault himself, we read Foucault’s mentors, interlocutors, and inheritors (Heidegger, Marx, Blanchot, Canguilhem, Derrida, Barthes, Althusser, Bersani, Hartman, Angela Davis, etc); his critics (Mbembe, Weheliye, Butler, Said, etc.), and scholarship that situates his thought alongside contemporary social movements, including student, Black liberation, prison abolitionist, and anti-psychiatry movements.\n",

The course’s TFs must enroll in the pedagogy seminar; they receive full course credit but not toward their degree requirements. This course intends to properly recognize the additional time required of faculty who offer large lecture classes, especially in the fulfillment of the responsibilities outlined in the start of term memo. Courses with sections require substantive guidance on teaching, including weekly teaching fellow meetings, meetings, section visits, and discussions of course assessment. This course is graded SAT/UNSAT. Two student-teaching fellows are able to submit teaching evaluations of their experience in this pedagogy seminar through the course evaluation process.\n",
      "ER&M 730 Race, Migration, and Coloniality in Europe. Fatima El-Tayeb. Europe’s rise to global dominance is inseparable from the invention of race as a key structuring principle of modernity. Yet, despite the geographic and intellectual origin of this concept in Europe and the explicitly race-based policies of both its fascist regimes and its colonial empires, the continent often is marginal at best in discourses on race. This is particularly true for contemporary configurations, which are often closely identified with the United States as center of both structural racism and of resistance to it. Europe diverges from the US model of racialization in ways that tend to be misread, especially on the continent itself, as the absence of race as a relevant social and political category. Accordingly, most Europeans continue to believe that racial thinking has had no lasting impact on the continent, that race matters everywhere but in Europe and is brought there exclusively through non-white others, whose presence is perpetually perceived as recent, temporary, and problematically upsetting a prior non-racial normalcy. Contrary to this perception, while racial slavery and native dispossession and genocide were foundational to the United States, in Europe, the racializing of religion and colonialism fundamentally shaped and continue to shape the continental identity. Until recently, however, this history was virtually absent from public debates, official commemorations, and policy decisions. This course is devoted to exploring the numerous counter-histories challenging the dominant narrative of European \"colorblindness,\" among them the long history of European Roma and Sinti, the racialization of Muslims, the mainstreaming of white supremacy and the ongoing \"refugee crisis,\" European economic neocolonialism in Africa, anti-Blackness and the legacies of slavery and colonialism, the relationship between racism and anti-Semitism, and strategies of resistance by racialized communities.\n",

This lecture course explores the crucial role that climate and environmental conditions have played in American history from the period of European colonization to the end of the 19th century. Its focus is on the dramatic changes brought about by the encounters among Indigenous, European, and African peoples in this period, the influence of climate and climate change on these encounters, and the environmental transformations brought about by European colonization and conquest and the creation of new economies and polities (including chattel slavery). The lectures offer a new framework for organizing and periodizing North American history, based on geographical and environmental conditions rather than traditional national and political frameworks.

      "EVST 210 The State and its Environment. Benjamin Kaplow, Jonathan Wyrtzen. This course engages two core entwined questions: How does the state impact its surroundings and  environment? And, how do these impact the state? The goal of this course is to give students a grounding in an interdisciplinary range of relevant social science literatures that help them think through those questions and how they relate to each other. The course addresses how states interact with and impact their ecological environment, but centers broader questions of how states relate to space, resources, populations, and to the socially constructed patterns of their physical, cultural, and economic environments. In doing so, the course aims to bridge discussions of state politics with political questions of the environment. In broadening the topic from only ecology, the class aims to help students develop a portable lens with which to examine state formation and its past and present impact in a variety of contexts: economic planning, systems of land management, military rule, taxation, and population control.\n",

      "EVST 229 Reading Environments: Nature, Culture, and Agency. Luna Najera. Extreme weather, proliferation of species extinctions, climate migration, and the outbreak of pandemics can all be understood as instances of koyaanisqatsi, the Hopi word for life out of balance. They may also be viewed as indications that we are living in the age of the Anthropocene, a term in the natural and social sciences that acknowledges that human activities have had a radical geological impact on the planet since the onset of the Industrial revolution. In this course we study relations between humans and other-than-humans to understand how we arrived at a life out of balance. We inquire into how binary distinctions between nature and culture are made, sustained, or questioned through a diversity of meaning-making practices in Spanish, Latin American, and indigenous literature, visual culture, and material culture. The indigenous artifacts studied include Popol Vuh, poetry, petroglyphs, and documentaries by indigenous people of the Amazon, which provide opportunities for asking pressing questions: To what extent does the nature and culture binary foreclose alternative possibilities for imagining ourselves and our relation to the world? Are there ways of perceiving our world and ourselves that bypass such binaries and if so, what are they? In the final weeks of the course, we draw from our insights to investigate where the nature/culture binary figures in present discussions of environmental catastrophes and rights of nature movements in Latin America. Taught in Spanish.\n",

      "EVST 258 Wilderness in the North American Imagination: Landscapes of the US Nuclear-Industrial Complex. Charlotte Hecht. Since the mid-twentieth century, the drive for nuclear power—in the form of weapons and energy—has irreversibly shaped the landscapes of the North American continent, and the world. The activities of the nuclear fuel cycle (uranium mining and milling, weapons testing and production, and radioactive waste dumping) have reached every state in the country, often in devastating and uneven ways. Today, debates about nuclear weapons and the benefits of nuclear power are at the forefront of contemporary discourse. This course contextualizes these impacts and debates in the long history of post-war industrialization and militarization, a history that begins with 19th century settler-colonial conceptions of \"wilderness.\" Throughout the course, we investigate how cultural imaginaries of wilderness (and ideas about nature, landscape, space, and environment) are deeply related to the uneven geographies of the nuclear industrial complex, and the intersections of US imperialism, militarism, extractive capitalism, and environmental racism. Alongside this, we consider how artists, activists, and scholars are working to theorize, reframe, and reimagine the legacies of the nuclear industry.\n",

      "EVST 323 Wetlands Ecology Conservation & Management. Kealoha Freidenburg. Wetlands are ubiquitous. Collectively they cover 370,000 square miles in the United States and globally encompass more than 5 million square miles. Most points on a map are less than 1 km from the nearest wetland. Yet wetlands are nearly invisible to most people. In this course we explore wetlands in all of their dimensions, including the critical services they provide to other systems, the rich biodiversity they harbor, their impact on global climate, and the links by which they connect to other systems. Additionally, wetlands are lynchpin environments for scientific policy and regulation. The overarching aim of the course is to connect what we know about wetlands from a scientific perspective to the ways in which wetlands matter for people.\n",
      "EVST 335 Global Human-Wildlife Interactions. Nyeema Harris. Wildlife and humans have increasingly complex interactions, balancing a myriad of potentially positive and negative outcomes.

      "EVST 350 Writing the World. Verlyn Klinkenborg. This is a practical writing course meant to develop the student’s skills as a writer. But its real subject is perception and the writer’s authority—the relationship between what you notice in the world around you and what, culturally speaking, you are allowed to notice. What you write during the term is driven entirely by your own interest and attention. How you write is the question at hand. We explore the overlapping habitats of language—present and past—and the natural environment. And, to a lesser extent, we explore the character of persuasion in environmental themes. Every member of the class writes every week, and we all read what everyone writes every week. It makes no difference whether you are a would-be journalist, scientist, environmental advocate, or policy maker. The goal is to rework your writing and sharpen your perceptions, both sensory and intellectual. Enrollment limited to fifteen.\n",
      "EVST 354 The Ancient State: Genesis and Crisis from Mesopotamia to Mexico. Harvey Weiss. Ancient states were societies with surplus agricultural production, classes, specialization of labor, political hierarchies, monumental public architecture and, frequently, irrigation, cities, and writing. Pristine state societies, the earliest civilizations, arose independently from simple egalitarian hunting and gathering societies in six areas of the world. How and why these earliest states arose are among the great questions of post-Enlightenment social science. This course explains (1) why this is a problem, to this day, (2) the dynamic environmental forces that drove early state formation, and (3) the unresolved fundamental questions of ancient state genesis and crisis, –law-like regularities or a chance coincidence of heterogenous forces?\n",
      "EVST 372 Biochemistry and Our Changing Climate. Climate change is impacting how cells and organisms grow and reproduce. Imagine the ocean spiking a fever: cold-blooded organisms of all shapes, sizes and complexities struggle to survive when water temperatures go up 2-4 degrees. Some organisms adapt to extremes, while others cannot. Predicted and observed changes in temperature, pH and salt concentration do and will affect many parameters of the living world, from the kinetics of chemical reactions and cellular signaling pathways to the accumulation of unforeseen chemicals in the environment, the appearance and dispersal of new diseases, and the development of new foods. In this course, we approach climate change from the molecular point of view, identifying how cells and organisms―from microbes to plants and animals―respond to changing environmental conditions. To embrace the concept of \"one health\" for all life on the planet, this course leverages biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biophysics, and genetics to develop an understanding of the impact of climate change on the living world. We consider the foundational knowledge that biochemistry can bring to the table as we meet the challenge of climate change.\n",
      "EVST 390 Power in Conservation. Carol Carpenter. This course examines the anthropology of power, particularly power in conservation interventions in the global South. It is intended to give students a toolbox of ideas about power in order to improve the effectiveness of conservation. Conservation thought and practice are power-laden: conservation thought is powerfully shaped by the history of ideas of nature and its relation to people, and conservation interventions govern and affect peoples and ecologies. This course argues that being able to think deeply, particularly about power, improves conservation policy making and practice. Political ecology is by far the best known and published approach to thinking about power in conservation; this course emphasizes the relatively neglected but robust anthropology of conservation literature outside political ecology, especially literature rooted in Foucault. It is intended to make four of Foucault’s concepts of power accessible, concepts that are the most used in the anthropology of conservation: the power of discourses, discipline and governmentality, subject formation, and neoliberal governmentality. The important ethnographic literature that these concepts have stimulated is also examined. Together, theory and ethnography can underpin our emerging understanding of a new, Anthropocene-shaped world.\n",

      "EVST 450 Carbon Containment. Anastasia O'Rourke, Dean Takahashi, Michael Oristaglio, Sinead Crotty. There is growing recognition that reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions alone is not sufficient to mitigate catastrophic effects of global climate change. As GHGs accumulate in the atmosphere, it is increasingly important to draw down these emissions cost-effectively in large quantities via carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) techniques–which can be broadly described as \"carbon containment.\" Recognizing the urgency of the problem at hand and the need for private and philanthropic action, many large companies, investors, and donors have stepped up commitments to stabilize the climate and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In addition to decarbonization strategies that reduce emissions, climate leaders are investing in and purchasing credits from negative emission carbon containment projects that reduce atmospheric levels of GHGs. Currently, the options for entities to credibly meet ambitious climate goals using carbon containment approaches are very limited. This goal of this course is to: (1) teach and engage students from a range of disciplines about the existing technologies and markets for carbon containment, (2) investigate nascent or neglected carbon containment mechanisms, and (3) develop case studies highlighting strategies and risks for moving promising pre-commercial ideas from concept to practice.\n",

      "FILM 298 Digital War. From drones and autonomous robots to algorithmic warfare, virtual war gaming, and data mining, digital war has become a key pressing issue of our times and an emerging field of study. This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.\n",

      "FILM 318 German Film from 1945 to the Present. Fatima Naqvi. Trauma, gender, media, transnationalism, terrorism, migration, precarity, neoliberalism, and environmental ethics are the issues we study in films from the German-speaking world. We begin in the immediate post-war period: How does the Second World War and its aftermath inflect these films? How does gender play an increasingly important role in the fiction films under discussion? What new collective identities do films articulate in the course of the politicized period from the late 1960s into the late 1970s, when home-grown terrorism contests the category of the West German nation? How do the predominant concerns shift with the passage of time and with the changing media formats? What is the role of genre in representing transnational problems like migration after 2000? How do economic issues come to the fore in the precarious economic conditions shown? When does violence seem like an  answer to political, economic, and social pressures and the legacies of colonialism? Particular attention is paid to film aesthetics. Films include those by Julian Radlmaier, Hubert Sauper, Sudabeh Mortezai, Fatih Akin, Wolfgang Staudte, Alexander Kluge, Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Schroeter, Harun Farocki, Michael Haneke, Christian Petzold, Jessica Hausner, Mara Mattuschka, Ulrich Seidl, Nikolaus Geyrhalter, among others. Visiting directors Julian Radlmaier and Hubert Sauper will be integrated into the course.\n",
      "FILM 321 Radical Cinemas in the Global Sixties. Lorenz Hegel, Moira Fradinger. \"1968\" has become a cipher for a moment of global turmoil, social transformation and cultural revolution. This class explores the \"long global sixties\" through cinema produced across continents. At the height of the Cold War between two blocks in the \"East\" and the \"West,\" the \"Third World\" emerged as a radical political project alternative to a world order shaped by centuries of colonialism, imperialism, slavery, and capitalist exploitation. Liberation, emancipation, independence, anticolonialism, decolonization, and revolution became key words in the global political discourse. Leaders from Africa, Asia, and Latin America created a new international platform, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) that challenged the Cold War bi-polarity. Radical filmmakers who belong in this period experimented with strategies of storytelling and of capturing reality, calling into question rigid distinctions between \"documentary\" and \"fiction\" and \"art and politics.\" The goal was not to \"show\" reality, but to change it. We study a world-wide range of examples that involve filmmakers’ collaborations across The Americas, Western Europe, North Africa, South and South-East Asia. Taught in English; films aresubtitled but knowledge of other languages may be useful.\n",
      "FILM 341 Weird Greek Wave Cinema. George Syrimis. The course examines the cinematic production of Greece in the last fifteen years or so and looks critically at the popular term \"weird Greek wave\" applied to it. Noted for their absurd tropes, bizarre narratives, and quirky characters, the films question and disturb traditional gender and social roles, as well as international viewers’ expectations of national stereotypes of classical luminosity―the proverbial \"Greek light\"―Dionysian exuberance, or touristic leisure. Instead, these works frustrate not only a wholistic reading of Greece as a unified and coherent social construct, but also the physical or aesthetic pleasure of its landscape and its ‘quaint’ people with their insistence on grotesque, violent, or otherwise disturbing images or themes (incest, sexual otherness and violence, aggression, corporeality, and xenophobia). The course also pays particular attention on the economic and political climate of the Greek financial crisis during which these films are produced and consumed and to which they partake.\n",

      "FILM 369 War Games. Marijeta Bozovic, Spencer Small. Dismissed, mocked, feared or loved for decades, video games have become a staple of contemporary media, art, and popular culture, studied alongside traditional print media and film. They eclipse the global yearly revenue of both film and music industries combined, leaving their financial significance undeniable. What remains understudied, however, is the political and cultural significance of the medium. War Games is a seminar dedicated to the intersection of video games and political violence (both real and imaginary) in a global and particularly post-Cold War context. Students learn to recognize patterns of ideological communication in video games while developing close reading skills of literature and digital media alike. We combine the study of video games with broader inquires into the media that circulate through the game mediaverse, including literature, social and news media, and film. Playing games and reading books, we pose the following questions: How do players \"perform\" war in games, and how might they resist or subvert expected performances? How indeed are we as readers and players affected by the type of media we consume? What is an adaptation? How do adaptations influence or potentially reshape our relationships with the source material? What themes and ideas are revealed effectively through one medium versus another? Why do certain literary traditions (such as classical Russian literature) provide such fruitful ground for video game adaptation? What are the political implications for the ideologies present in a video game given the globalized position of the medium? Assigned readings include novels, short stories, news media, and internet forums alongside a range of secondary materials, including film and media theory, intellectual and media histories, digital anthropology, reception studies, and interviews.\n",
      "FILM 378 Kindness in Film. Routinely, moviegoers vicariously experience injury, insult, will to power, and bloody revenge.  We expect–and crave–violent retribution in movie drama. What of kindness? Do we crave it? Is it possible to explore kindness without juxtaposing it with cruelty? Are virtues only understood in relation to vice? This semester we explore the challenges of depicting kindness in film drama. Additionally, class members will discuss and write about personal experiences with kindness, compassion, and grace. Limited to 15 students.\n",
      "FILM 417 Experimental Multimodal Videomaking and Exhibition. Leighton Pierce. In this course we make ten prompt driven one-minute video projects specifically designed to increase fluidity of thinking-through-videomaking. Some of the projects happen in class. Most are out-of-class assignments for which I give specific problems to solve or parameters to work within. Some assignments we design as a class. When we are not shooting or editing in class we exercise our critical skills by screening projects and discussing them. We take experimental approaches to the process of making these 10 videos as we glance toward the standard cinematic categories of drama, documentary, experimental film, and animation as we glide past. These categories are familiar, but not always productive, divisions among modes of production since none of these categories defines clear boundaries between practices. Instead, this class leads us closer to understanding the complex array of contingencies impinging on all filmmaking processes. We take an ecologically based, transdisciplinary attitude rather than a categorized genre-based categorization. We continually ask, how do the various aspects and approaches to a filmmaking environment  interact and modify each other? Through weekly prompt based video-making exercises, we navigate through a topography of filmmaking and exhibition practices.\n",

      "FILM 460 Sound/Image Practice. Leighton Pierce. We start from the assumption that sound is actually the ‘secret-sauce’ in the film/videomaking process. Often overlooked–or at least neglected, sound is a potent tool to advance the logic of a film or video and even more, to enhance the emotional patina and immersive engagement of a film or video. Sound becomes an accessible portal to the perhaps overlooked not-quite-conscious realm of the film/video experience. While we certainly read some theory/history of sound, this is primarily a class of making. The first 7 weeks include videomaking exercises designed to highlight specific challenges in sound for picture. The core concern is with conceptual development in the myriad ways that sound and picture work together. There is no genre or mode preference in this class. Fiction, non-fiction, experimental, animation, game, tiktok, anything is okay. For the second half of the semester, each student (or collaborative small group–with permission) design, shoot, edit, and mix a short (3-5min) video of their own design–a video that demonstrates attention and developing sophistication in the use of sound with picture, as well as in how to design visual shots and temporal structures (editing) with sound in mind. The visual and auditory aspects of any video are entangled in such a way that contribute (when blended with the audience’s imagination and memory) to the formation of the Sound/Image in the audience member’s minds.\n",
      "FILM 470 Women Filmmakers. Oksana Chefranova. The seminar surveys the extraordinary contributions that female filmmakers have made to cinema and to film theory, ranging from the beginning of cinema to the most recent examples, from narrative cinema to experimental practice. We examine films by Lois Weber, Alice Guy Blaché, Germaine Dulac, Leontine Sagan, Leni Riefenstahl, Dorothy Arzner, Ida Lupino, Maya Deren, Agnès Varda, Věra Chytilová, Barbara Hammer, Julie Dash, Claire Denis, Lucrecia Martel, Kelly Reichardt, Sofia Coppola, Alice Rohrwacher, Céline Sciamma, Ana Lily Amirpour, and Mati Diop. We read texts written by women writer, filmmakers, and critics such as Germaine Dulac, Maya Deren, Barbara Hammer, Julie Dash, Colette, Virginia Woolf, Laura Mulvey, and Manohla Dargis. The cinema is approached from a variety of historical and theoretical discourses such as production history, feminism, world cinema, and post-colonial studies among others.

      "FILM 617 Psychoanalysis: Key Conceptual Differences between Freud and Lacan I. Moira Fradinger. This is the first section of a year-long seminar (second section: CPLT 914) designed to introduce the discipline of psychoanalysis through primary sources, mainly from the Freudian and Lacanian corpuses but including late twentieth-century commentators and contemporary interdisciplinary conversations. We rigorously examine key psychoanalytic concepts that students have heard about but never had the chance to study. Students gain proficiency in what has been called \"the language of psychoanalysis,\" as well as tools for critical practice in disciplines such as literary criticism, political theory, film studies, gender studies, theory of ideology, psychology medical humanities, etc. We study concepts such as the unconscious, identification, the drive, repetition, the imaginary, fantasy, the symbolic, the real, and jouissance. A central goal of the seminar is to disambiguate Freud's corpus from Lacan's reinvention of it. We do not come to the \"rescue\" of Freud. We revisit essays that are relevant for contemporary conversations within the international psychoanalytic community. We include only a handful of materials from the Anglophone schools of psychoanalysis developed in England and the US. This section pays special attention to Freud's \"three\" (the ego, superego, and id) in comparison to Lacan's \"three\" (the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real). CPLT 914 devotes, depending on the interests expressed by the group, the last six weeks to special psychoanalytic topics such as sexuation, perversion, psychosis, anti-asylum movements, conversations between psychoanalysis and neurosciences and artificial intelligence, the current pharmacological model of mental health, and/or to specific uses of psychoanalysis in disciplines such as film theory, political philosophy, and the critique of ideology. Apart from Freud and Lacan, we will read work by Georges Canguilhem, Roman Jakobson, Victor Tausk, Émile Benveniste, Valentin Volosinov, Guy Le Gaufey, Jean Laplanche, Étienne Balibar, Roberto Esposito, Wilfred Bion, Félix Guattari, Markos Zafiropoulos, Franco Bifo Berardi, Barbara Cassin, Renata Salecl, Maurice Godelier, Alenka Zupančič, Juliet Mitchell, Jacqueline Rose, Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing, Eric Kandel, and Lera Boroditsky among others. No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis is needed. Starting out from basic questions, we study how psychoanalysis, arguably, changed the way we think of human subjectivity. Graduate students from all departments and schools on campus are welcome. The final assignment is due by the end of the spring term and need not necessarily take the form of a twenty-page paper. Taught in English. Materials can be provided to cover the linguistic range of the group.\n",

      "FILM 761 German Film from 1945 to the Present. Fatima Naqvi. We look at a variety of German-language feature films from 1945 to the present in order to focus on issues of trauma, guilt, remembrance (and its counterpart: amnesia), gender, Heimat or \"homeland,\" national and transnational self-fashioning, terrorism, and ethics. How do the Second World War and its legacy inflect these films? What sociopolitical and economic factors influence the individual and collective identities that these films articulate? How do the predominant concerns shift with the passage of time and with changing media? How is the category of nation constructed and contested within the narratives themselves? Close attention is paid to the aesthetic issues and the concept of authorship. Films by Staudte, Wolf, Kluge, Radax, Wenders, Fassbinder, Schroeter, Farocki, Haneke, Petzold, Schanelec, Seidl, Hausner, and Geyrhalter, among others.

      "FILM 833 Semiotics. Francesco Casetti. Digging into semiotics tradition, the seminar provides analytical tools for \"close readings\" of a vast array of objects and operations, from verbal texts to all sorts of images, from cultural practices to all sorts of manipulation. Semiotics’ foundational goal consisted in retracing how meaning emerges in these objects and operations, how it circulates within and between different cultural environments, and how it affects and is affected by the cultural contexts in which these objects and operations are embedded. To revamp semiotics’ main tasks, after an introduction about the idea of \"making meaning,\" the seminar engages students in a weekly discussion about situations, procedures, objects, and attributes that are \"meaningful,\" in the double sense that they have meaning and they arrange reality in a meaningful way. Objects of analysis are intentionally disparate; the constant application of a set of analytical tools provides the coherence of the seminar. Students are expected to regularly attend the seminar, actively participate in discussions, propose new objects of analysis, present a case study (fifteen–twenty minutes), and write a final paper (max. 5,000 words). Enrollment limited to fifteen.\n",

Considered one of the greatest novels of all time, Victor Hugo's Les Misérables (1862) offers more than a thrilling story, unforgettable characters, and powerful writing. It offers a window into history. Working from a new translation, this seminar studies Hugo's epic masterpiece in all its unabridged glory, but also uses it as a lens to explore the world of nineteenth-century France—including issues such as the criminal justice system, religion, poverty, social welfare, war, prostitution, industrialization, and revolution. Students gain the tools to work both as close readers and as cultural historians in order to illuminate the ways in which Hugo's text intersects with its context. Attention is also paid to famous stage and screen adaptations of the novel: what do they get right and what do they get wrong? Taught in English, no knowledge of French is required.\n",

      "FREN 378 Zombies, Witches, Goddesses: Disorderly Women in Francophone Fiction. Kaiama Glover. This course explores configurations of the feminine as a force of disorder in prose fiction works of the 20th-century French- and Creole-speaking Americas. How do certain kinds of women characters reflect the troubling realities of the communities in which they are embedded? What alternative modes of being might these women’s non– or even anticommunal practices of freedom suggest? How are matters of the erotic, the spiritual, and the maternal implicated in Caribbean women’s relationships to their communities? Through slow and careful readings of literary fiction and critical theory, we examine the ‘troubling’ heroines presented in prose fiction works by francophone Caribbean authors of both genders, considering the thematic intersections and common formal strategies that emerge in their writing. We consider in particular the symbolic value of the ‘zombie,’ the ‘witch,’ the ‘goddess,’ and other provocative characters as so many reflections on–and of–social phenomena that mark the region and its history.\n",

      "FREN 404 Inventories and Inventions: \"Cabinets de curiosité\" and the Writing of Singularity. Dominique Brancher. A seminar on \"cabinets de curiosités\" and the stories told about the objects they contain, whether real or invented. We pay close attention to catalogues, as modes of exhibition in their own right, as products of a collection, as well as vectors for the dissemination of a given collection of objects. We see how the catalogue is a textual crossroads, able to absorb, integrate, and sometimes correct developments in scholarly or travel writing. The catalogue is often also the pre-text to parodic or fictional forms. For example, some might claim to present imaginary collections. Others present themselves as real catalogs while exhibiting the signs of fabrication. Catalogues include \"Le Cabinet de M. de Scudéry\" (1646), \"Musaeum clausum\" or \"Bibliotheca abscondita\" by Thomas Browne (1684), and the fictitious catalogue included in Francis Bacon's \"La Nouvelle Atlantide\" (1627).

      "FREN 423 Interpretations: Simone Weil. Greg Ellermann. Intensive study of the life and work of Simone Weil, one of the twentieth century’s most important thinkers. We read the iconic works that shaped Weil’s posthumous reputation as \"the patron saint of all outsiders,\" including the mystical aphorisms Gravity and Grace and the utopian program for a new Europe The Need for Roots. But we also examine in detail the lesser-known writings Weil published in her lifetime–writings that powerfully intervene in some of the most pressing debates of her day. Reading Weil alongside contemporaries such as Trotsky, Heidegger, Arendt, Levinas, and Césaire, we see how her thought engages key philosophical, ethical, and aesthetic problems of the twentieth century: the relation between dictatorship and democracy; empire and the critique of colonialism; the ethics of attention and affliction; modern science, technology, and the human point of view; the responsibility of the writer in times of war; beauty and the possibility of transcendence; the practice of philosophy as a way of life.\n",

      "FREN 481 Racial Republic: African Diasporic Literature and Culture in Postcolonial France. Fadila Habchi. This is an interdisciplinary seminar on French cultural history from the 1930s to the present. We focus on issues concerning race and gender in the context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and migration. The course investigates how the silencing of colonial history has been made possible culturally and ideologically, and how this silencing has in turn been central to the reorganizing of French culture and society from the period of decolonization to the present. We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness. Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.\n",

      "FREN 841 Plant, Animal, Man: The Necessary “Art of Conference”. Dominique Brancher. This seminar examines the relationships between three terms: man, animal, and plant. Cultural history has long privileged the man-animal dyad. We try to understand how in early modern Europe discursive representations, sensitive to the dynamic interactions between these three communities, have built a shared history. We are brought back to the etymology of the term \"ecology\": these three areas of life interact in the same medium, oikos, that can be physical as well as textual. Our investigation thus attempts to sketch an archaeology of Western thought on life, the challenge being to reconstitute a forgotten model of reflection on the community between humanity and other forms of life. Readings in a multidisciplinary corpus that includes medical, legal, and theological productions; agronomic and hunting literature; herbaria; natural history books (Belon, Rondelet, Aldrovandi); travel accounts (Jean de Léry, Thevet); poetry (Ronsard, Baïf, Madeleine and Catherine des Roches); fiction (Alberti, Rostand, Sorel); autobiographical texts (Montaigne, Agrippa d’Aubigné); treatises (Du Bellay, Henri Estienne). Conducted in French.\n",
      "FREN 875 Psychoanalysis: Key Conceptual Differences between Freud and Lacan I. Moira Fradinger. This is the first section of a year-long seminar (second section: CPLT 914) designed to introduce the discipline of psychoanalysis through primary sources, mainly from the Freudian and Lacanian corpuses but including late twentieth-century commentators and contemporary interdisciplinary conversations. We rigorously examine key psychoanalytic concepts that students have heard about but never had the chance to study. Students gain proficiency in what has been called \"the language of psychoanalysis,\" as well as tools for critical practice in disciplines such as literary criticism, political theory, film studies, gender studies, theory of ideology, psychology medical humanities, etc. We study concepts such as the unconscious, identification, the drive, repetition, the imaginary, fantasy, the symbolic, the real, and jouissance. A central goal of the seminar is to disambiguate Freud's corpus from Lacan's reinvention of it. We do not come to the \"rescue\" of Freud. We revisit essays that are relevant for contemporary conversations within the international psychoanalytic community. We include only a handful of materials from the Anglophone schools of psychoanalysis developed in England and the US. This section pays special attention to Freud's \"three\" (the ego, superego, and id) in comparison to Lacan's \"three\" (the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real). CPLT 914 devotes, depending on the interests expressed by the group, the last six weeks to special psychoanalytic topics such as sexuation, perversion, psychosis, anti-asylum movements, conversations between psychoanalysis and neurosciences and artificial intelligence, the current pharmacological model of mental health, and/or to specific uses of psychoanalysis in disciplines such as film theory, political philosophy, and the critique of ideology. Apart from Freud and Lacan, we will read work by Georges Canguilhem, Roman Jakobson, Victor Tausk, Émile Benveniste, Valentin Volosinov, Guy Le Gaufey, Jean Laplanche, Étienne Balibar, Roberto Esposito, Wilfred Bion, Félix Guattari, Markos Zafiropoulos, Franco Bifo Berardi, Barbara Cassin, Renata Salecl, Maurice Godelier, Alenka Zupančič, Juliet Mitchell, Jacqueline Rose, Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing, Eric Kandel, and Lera Boroditsky among others. No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis is needed. Starting out from basic questions, we study how psychoanalysis, arguably, changed the way we think of human subjectivity. Graduate students from all departments and schools on campus are welcome. The final assignment is due by the end of the spring term and need not necessarily take the form of a twenty-page paper. Taught in English. Materials can be provided to cover the linguistic range of the group.\n",
      "FREN 880 Le poème en prose. Thomas Connolly. This seminar looks at the development of the poème en prose, from its beginnings as a response to the inadequacy of French verse forms, which were said to lend themselves poorly to the translation of ancient epic, to its emergence as an independent genre. What constitutes a prose poem, and why do we need to distinguish it from prose, poetry, and even poetic prose? Readings include work by Fénelon, Parny, Baudelaire, Bertrand, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Nerval, Mallarmé, Jacob, Michaux, Ponge, and Char, as well as Hölderlin, Poe, and Rilke.\n",
      "FREN 945 Introduction to Digital Humanities I: Architectures of Knowledge. Alexander Gil Fuentes. The cultural record of humanity is undergoing a massive and epochal transformation into shared analog and digital realities. While we are vaguely familiar with the history and realities of the analog record—libraries, archives, historical artifacts—the digital cultural record remains largely unexamined and relatively mysterious to humanities scholars. In this course students are introduced to the broad field of digital humanities, theory and practice, through a stepwise exploration of the new architectures and genres of scholarly and humanistic production and reproduction in the twenty-first century. The course combines a seminar, preceded by a brief lecture, and a digital studio. Every week we move through our discussions in tandem with hands-on exercises that serve to illuminate our readings and help students gain a measure of computational proficiency useful in humanities scholarship. Students learn about the basics of plain text, file and operating systems, data structures and internet infrastructure. Students also learn to understand, produce, and evaluate a few popular genres of digital humanities, including, digital editions of literary or historical texts, collections and exhibits of primary sources and interactive maps. Finally, and perhaps the most important lesson of the term, students learn to collaborate with each other on a common research project. No prior experience is required.\n",

      "GLBL 201 Origins of U.S. Global Power. David Engerman. This course examines the causes and the consequences of American global power in the \"long 20th century,\" peeking back briefly into the 19th century as well as forward into the present one. The focus is on foreign relations, which includes but is not limited to foreign policy; indeed, America’s global role was rooted as much in its economic and cultural power as it was in diplomacy and military strength. We study events like wars, crises, treaties, and summits—but also trade shows and movie openings. Our principal subjects include plenty of State Department officials, but also missionaries, business people, and journalists. We pay close attention also to conceptions of American power; how did observers in and beyond the United States understand the nature, origins, and operations of American power?\n",

      "GLBL 210 The State and its Environment. Benjamin Kaplow, Jonathan Wyrtzen. This course engages two core entwined questions: How does the state impact its surroundings and  environment? And, how do these impact the state? The goal of this course is to give students a grounding in an interdisciplinary range of relevant social science literatures that help them think through those questions and how they relate to each other. The course addresses how states interact with and impact their ecological environment, but centers broader questions of how states relate to space, resources, populations, and to the socially constructed patterns of their physical, cultural, and economic environments. In doing so, the course aims to bridge discussions of state politics with political questions of the environment. In broadening the topic from only ecology, the class aims to help students develop a portable lens with which to examine state formation and its past and present impact in a variety of contexts: economic planning, systems of land management, military rule, taxation, and population control.\n",

      "GLBL 224 Empires and Imperialism Since 1840. Arne Westad. Empire has been a main form of state structure throughout much of human history. Many of the key challenges the world faces today have their origins in imperial structures and policies, from wars and terror to racism and environmental destruction. This seminar looks at the transformation empires and imperialisms went through from the middle part of the nineteenth century and up to today. Our discussions center on how and why imperialisms moved from strategies of territorial occupation and raw exploitation, the \"smash and grab\" version of empire, and on to policies of racial hierarchies, social control and reform, and colonial concepts of civilizational progress, many of which are still with us today. The seminar also covers anti-colonial resistance, revolutionary organizations and ideas, and processes of decolonization.\n",

      "GLBL 244 The Politics of Fascism. Lauren Young. The subject of this course is fascism: its rise in Europe in the 1930s and deployment during the Second World War as a road map to understanding the resurgence of nationalism and populism in today’s political landscape, both in Europe and the United States. The course begins with an examination of the historic debates around fascism, nationalism, populism, and democracy. It then moves geographically through the 1930s and 1940s in Europe, looking specifically at Weimar Germany, Vichy France, the rise of fascism in England in the 1930s, and how fascist ideology was reflected in Italy’s colonial ambitions during the Abyssinian War. The course examines fascism and the implementation of racial theory and the example of anti-Semitism as an ideological and political tool. It also looks at the emergence of fascism in visual culture. The second part of the seminar turns to fascist ideology and the realities of today’s political world.  We examine the political considerations of building a democratic state, question the compromise between security and the preservation of civil liberties and look at the resurgence of populism and nationalism in Europe and the US. The course concludes by examining the role of globalization in contemporary political discourse.\n",
      "GLBL 249 Introduction to Critical Data Studies. Julian Posada, Madiha Tahir. \"Big data\" has become a buzzword these days—but what is data? This course introduces the study of data and data technologies and techniques through a critical, anti-colonial lens with profound attention to the power dynamics that constitute what is today called \"data.\" From the seemingly opaque play of algorithms to artificial intelligence and surveillance systems, to digital media and the culture industries, various systems rely on the storage, transaction, classification, and exploitation of datasets. Data is, in short, both a medium that relies on and reconfigures power. This class discusses methods for the study of data technologies and techniques from multiple interdisciplinary humanities and social science perspectives. Through academic scholarship as well as art and data visualizations, students interrogate: How is data constituted through its entanglements with power? What is the relationship between data and social and material inequality? What methods can we use to study the making of data? How can we envision decolonial data technologies and techniques?\n",

      "GLBL 287 Capitalism and Crisis. Isabela Mares. This course provides an introduction to the study of comparative capitalism. We examine how institutions organizing labor markets, finance and the welfare state differ systematically across advanced industrialized countries and the consequence of these differences for a variety of economic and policy outcomes. These include economic growth, unemployment, levels of inequality and so on. Can we meaningfully talk about a German or Swedish model and if so, what are the main institutional arrangements that differ across these economies? How do institutions in these countries differ from more liberal capitalist economies, such as the United States? In the second part of the course, we examine the responses of different countries to a variety of economic shocks. These include the stagflation crisis of the 1970’s, the slowdown in economic growth, deindustrialization, the rise in unemployment and inequality and the migration crisis. We examine how existing political and economic institutions have shaped the policy trade-offs encountered by different countries and we explain the different political responses taken in response to these crises. During the period between November 14 and November 24, enrollment will be limited to majors. After November 24, registration will be opened to all Yale College students. Please register your interest via the Yale Course Search website.\n",

These include the stagflation crisis of the 1970’s, the slowdown in economic growth, deindustrialization, the rise in unemployment and inequality and the migration crisis. We examine how existing political and economic institutions have shaped the policy trade-offs encountered by different countries and we explain the different political responses taken in response to these crises. During the period between November 14 and November 24, enrollment will be limited to majors. After November 24, registration will be opened to all Yale College students.

      "GLBL 287 Capitalism and Crisis. This course provides an introduction to the study of comparative capitalism. We examine how institutions organizing labor markets, finance and the welfare state differ systematically across advanced industrialized countries and the consequence of these differences for a variety of economic and policy outcomes. These include economic growth, unemployment, levels of inequality and so on. Can we meaningfully talk about a German or Swedish model and if so, what are the main institutional arrangements that differ across these economies?

      "GLBL 289 War and Peace in Northern Ireland. Examination of theoretical and empirical literature in response to questions about the insurgency and uneasy peace in Northern Ireland following the peace agreement of 1998 which formally ended the three-decade long civil conflict known widely as The Troubles and was often lauded as the most successful of its kind in modern history. Consideration of how both the conflict and the peace have been messier and arguably more divisive than most outside observers realize.\n",

      "GLBL 313 The United Nations on the Ground. Jessica Faieta. This course explores the role and functioning of the United Nations at the country level from the perspective of the three mandates or pillars of the UN Charter. 1) Peace and Security, and in particular the Peace-keeping operations: how do they work? Who decides to send a UN mission to a country? what do they do in each country? 2) Development: How does the UN helps countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals? Which are the different UN agencies, funds, and programs and how do they work in reducing poverty, advancing gender equality, preventing violence, fighting climate change and protecting the environment or ensuring food security? and 3) Human rights: How does the UN respond to humanitarian crises, such as natural disasters or refugee crisis? What is its role in protecting vulnerable populations such as children, ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples? How does the Organization monitor human rights compliance or helps avoid human rights violations?\n",

      "GLBL 319 Human Rights and the Climate Crisis. Daniel Wilkinson. As climate change takes a mounting toll on the lives and livelihoods of people around the globe, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting \"climate resilience\" have become, arguably, the most pressing challenges of our era. This seminar examines the climate crisis through the lens of human rights. How is climate change impacting people’s rights? And how can advocacy for people’s rights contribute to efforts to address climate change? We explore the scientific, political, and legal bases for attributing responsibility for climate impacts to governments and corporations, examine how international human rights norms obligate them to address these impacts, and assess the strategies, tactics, and tools employed by rights advocates to compel them to meet these obligations. More broadly, we consider how the exigencies of the climate crisis could ultimately undermine—or actually strengthen—the international human rights regime. Students are encouraged to question and critique positions taken by a range of climate activists, while simultaneously equipping themselves with the knowledge and analytical tools necessary to advocate effectively for ambitious, rights-respecting climate action.\n",
      "GLBL 323 International Politics of the Middle East: Perception and Misperception in Four Crises. Robert Malley. This course examines a series of seminal conflicts or crises in the Middle East, focusing on the assumptions, competing narratives, and misunderstandings that have fueled them. It is not a comprehensive history of the region. Rather, it is an in-depth exploration of key issues that arise from exploring four topics: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; the U.S. invasion of Iraq; the Syrian civil war; and diplomacy surrounding the Iranian nuclear program. Each case is taught from the perspective of an American diplomatic practitioner and policy-maker, but with an analytic bent, delving into broader issues such as the question of objectivity and bias, the role of the media in foreign policy, the problem of perception and misperception in international diplomacy, and the dilemmas of humanitarian intervention. We balance the perspectives of various state and non-state regional and international actors as we seek to uncover the reasons behind their decision-making and behavior. The focus, in other words, is less on memorizing details of these particular cases than on using the cases to explore these broader issues of international diplomacy.\n",
      "GLBL 335 Causes, Consequences, and Policy Implications of Global Economic Inequality. Murray Leibbrandt. By working through a number of influential contemporary texts, we investigate the causes and consequences of economic inequality. Some of the mechanisms include financial markets, credit and savings, health, education, globalization, discrimination, social networks, and political processes. We explore both the theoretical and empirical literature, as well as possible policy interventions. We conclude with country-level case studies.\n",

Admission is by application only; the cycle for the current year is closed. This course does not fulfill the history seminar requirement, but may count toward geographical distributional credit within the History major for any region studied, upon application to the director of undergraduate studies.\n",
      "GLBL 382 Designing and Reforming Democracy. David Froomkin, Ian Shapiro. What is the best electoral system? Should countries try to limit the number of political parties? Should chief executives be independently elected? Should legislatures have powerful upper chambers? Should courts have the power to strike down democratically enacted laws? These and related questions are taken up in this course. Throughout the semester, we engage in an ongoing dialogue with the Federalist Papers, contrasting the Madisonian constitutional vision with subsequent insights from democratic theory and empirical political science across the democratic world. Where existing practices deviate from what would be best, we also attend to the costs of these sub-optimal systems and types of reforms that would improve them.\n",
      "GLBL 388 The Politics of American Foreign Policy. Howard Dean. This seminar addresses the domestic political considerations that have affected American foreign policy in the post-World War II world. The goals of the course are to (1) give historical context to the formation of major existing global governance structures, (2) give students an opportunity to research how major foreign policy decisions in the past were influenced by contemporary political pressure, and (3) assess what effect those pressures have had on today’s global issues. Case studies include, but are not limited to: Truman and the Marshall Plan; Johnson and the Vietnam War; Nixon and the opening of China; Reagan and the collapse of the Soviet Union, George HW Bush and Iraq, Clinton and the Balkans, and Obama and the development of a multipolar foreign policy for a multipolar world.\n",

      "GLBL 425 Atrocity Prevention. David Simon. Can atrocities be prevented? This course considers the ways in which episodes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes might be preventable. It looks at ways in which models of atrocities yield corresponding models of prevention, and then what policies those models, in turn, recommend. We consider a broad number of cases of prevention, devoting attention to the different phases and agents of the prevention efforts in question. We analyze the extent to which prevention efforts at different levels have been successful while being mindful of the costs that accompanied them. We aim to draw conclusions about what strategies key actors can deploy to reduce the incidence of mass atrocities throughout the world.\n",
      "GLBL 430 Turning Points in Peace-building. Bisa Williams. This seminar examines the challenges that must be addressed when the fighting has stopped. Once a peace agreement is signed, real deal-making begins. Former rebels negotiate with their military commanders about relinquishing arms and working for a living; communities look for \"peace dividends,\" refugees weigh options to return home; Governments try to assert authority despite how weakened they have become or new to the role they are; compatriots who opposed the peace settlement relentlessly try to undermine it. The international community, which often leads warring parties to the table, takes on a new role also, informing and sometimes deforming outcomes. Building a durable peace requires a sensitivity to the changing priorities of the signatories and international community, as well as the constituencies for whom the peace was achieved. Anchored in (but not limited to) the ongoing UN-supported peace agreement implementation process in Mali and the monitoring process of the Final Agreement to End Armed Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace in Colombia, the seminar considers peace-building processes from the perspectives of formerly warring parties, diplomats, NGOs, and civil society, providing students an opportunity to begin to catalogue strategies for building durable peace following conflict.\n",

While policy writing draws upon principles familiar to academic writing, it has its own conventions, which are rooted in the needs and practices of policy professionals. In a series of assignments, students carry out every step of the policy analysis process, from defining, framing, and analyzing the problem to identifying and evaluating possible solutions, to building a case for recommendations. Students also learn principles for editing their writing for clarity and concision and gain extensive experience applying those principles to written work. In addition to reading and critiquing the writing of their peers, students also study a selection of texts intended to enhance understanding of the writing and editing process. Assignments include a backgrounder/stakeholder analysis, options analysis, and op-ed.\n",

This course covers key economic theories/models used for the analysis of micro- and macroeconomic policy issues. We spend half the course covering microeconomics topics such consumer and producer choices, effects of market intervention, market competition, and issues with public goods. In the second half, we move to the larger (macro) economic picture and discuss topics such as measures of economic growth, inflation, the labor market, and the financial market. The course emphasizes training economic intuition and providing space for students to explore how these economic concepts relate to policy issues of their interest. The course also provides the economic background necessary to enroll in the Global Economics core GLBL 5010, taken in the spring term.\n",

      "GLBL 5020 Applied Methods of Analysis. Justin Thomas. This course is an introduction to statistics and their application in public policy and global affairs research. It consists of two weekly class sessions in addition to a discussion section. The discussion section is used to cover problems encountered in the lectures and written assignments, as well as to develop statistical computing skills. Throughout the term we cover issues related to data collection (including surveys, sampling, and weighted data), data description (graphical and numerical techniques for summarizing data), probability and probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, measures of association, and regression analysis. The course assumes no prior knowledge of statistics and no mathematical knowledge beyond calculus. Graded only, sat/unsat option is not permissible.\n",

In this course students investigate how government organization and the structure of political competition shape the conditions for better and worse economic policy making across a range of economic policies including macroeconomic policy, corporate and financial regulation, industrial policy, and trade. Students consider these policy areas in democratic and nondemocratic regimes, and in developed and developing countries. Graded only, sat/unsat option is not permissible.\n",
      "GLBL 5050 Introduction to Python for Global Affairs. William King. In the second decade of the twenty-first century, \"big data\" analytics and techniques have fundamentally transformed policy decisions both in the United States and throughout the globe. NGOs, NPOs, political campaigns, think tanks, and government agencies more and more recruit policy analysts with the necessary skills to embrace novel, data-driven approaches to policy creation and evaluation. This course is designed to help students meet this growing demand. It is an introductory course in Python programming and data analysis for policy students with no prior coding experience. Unlike massive introductory classes, this course is deliberately small, designed to provide the necessary support for humanists to make a smooth and nurturing transition to \"tech humanists.\" Ultimately, students should be comfortable using what they’ve learned in further Yale courses in programming and statistics, or in research and policy after leaving Yale. They should know enough to productively collaborate on projects with engineers, understand the potential of such work, have sufficient background to expand their skills with more advanced classes, and perform rudimentary data analyses and make policy recommendations based on these analyses.\n",
      "GLBL 5065 Intro to AI: From Turing to ChatGPT. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to Artificial Intelligence including a history of general AI (from Turing and \"the test\" through the \"AI winter\" to present); the possibility and fears of an AI that could supplant humanity and the sceptics who mock those fears as irrational; and the current, more narrow definitions and technical applications of what is referred to as AI including deep learning, neural networks and machine learning. From these building blocks, students consider certain applications of AI to national defense, climate change, and government policies with an eye to the tension between technological capability and ethical imperatives. The goal of this course is for students to emerge first and foremost, with a more advanced tech literacy, if not fluency and to possess a strong AI- and machine-learning working vocabulary. Further, students learn how to effectively differentiate AI from ML, myth from reality, and rational fear from speculative science fiction.\n",

For nearly twenty years, the world has seen the role, funding, and employment of U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) increase in ways that might seem unrecognizable to previous generations of civilian and military leaders. As the world transitions from two decades of SOF-heavy conflict into Great Power Competition among nation states, an understanding of the SOF community’s history, evolution, and future will be critical for those trying to navigate national security questions in the decades to come. This course looks specifically at historic utilization of these forces and at post-9/11 expansion of authorities, funding, and mission-sets; and it considers what their proper role and function may look like moving forward. Students gain a foundational understanding of a relatively small component of the U.S. military with an outsized strategic position on the global stage.\n",
      "GLBL 6000 Explanatory Writing for a Broad Audience. David Leonhardt. In this seminar, a New York Times senior writer teaches core principles of communicating ideas to a general audience. The course focuses on writing and also covers data visualization, interviewing, and podcasting. We study the ways that clearly expressed arguments have changed the world and allowed political leaders to rise from obscurity. Assignments include the writing of an op-ed, the creation of a data visualization, and the production of a radio-style interview. The instructor has worked at The Times for more than twenty years, as Washington bureau chief, op-ed columnist, podcast host, magazine writer, and founding editor of The Upshot, which emphasizes data visualization.\n",
      "GLBL 6115 Topics in Computer Science and Global Affairs. Joan Feigenbaum, Ted Wittenstein. This course focuses on \"socio-technical\" problems in computing and international relations. These are problems that cannot be solved through technological progress alone but rather require legal, political, or cultural progress as well.  Examples include but are not limited to cyber espionage, disinformation, ransomware attacks, and intellectual-property theft. This course is offered jointly by the SEAS Computer Science Department and the Jackson School of Global Affairs. It is addressed to graduate students who are interested in socio-technical issues but whose undergraduate course work may not have addressed them; it is designed to bring these students rapidly to the point at which they can do research on socio-technical problems.\n",
      "GLBL 6170 Chinese Law and Society. Taisu Zhang. This course surveys law and legal practice in the People's Republic of China. Particular attention is given to the interaction of legal institutions with politics, social change, and economic development. Specific topics include, among others, the Party State, state capitalism, the judiciary, property law and development, business and investment law, criminal law and procedure, media (especially the Internet), and major schools of Chinese legal and political thought.

      "GLBL 6225 The Politics of American Foreign Policy. Howard Dean. This seminar addresses the domestic political considerations that have affected American foreign policy in the post-World War II world. The goals are to give historical context to the formation of major existing global governance structures, give students an opportunity to research how major foreign policy decisions in the past were influenced by contemporary political pressure, and assess what effect those pressures have had on today’s global issues. Case studies include but are not limited to Truman and the Marshall Plan; Johnson and the Vietnam War; Nixon and the opening of China; Reagan and the collapse of the Soviet Union; George H.W. Bush and Iraq; Clinton and the Balkans; and Obama and the development of a multipolar foreign policy for a multipolar world. Students assume the role of decision-makers under political pressure and are asked to generate a point of view regarding past, present, and future foreign policy decisions.\n",
      "GLBL 6250 Town & Gown: Global Perspectives on a Troubled Relationship. Abdul-Rehman Malik. In this seminar, we examine the state of town-gown relationships and their repercussions on the cultivation of a good society. Sensitively engaging with New Haven as a site for understanding and grappling with these issues, we explore the ways in which higher education institutions engage, interface with, and impact the civic spaces they inhabit, with particular reference to economic development, political power, and social inclusion. We ask, what is the responsibility of Yale to building \"the good society\" in New Haven? Drawing on the lived experience of global thought leaders—drawn from the Yale World Fellows and beyond—we look at case studies and approaches to town-gown that offer examples of good practice and provide frameworks for understanding what can go wrong, and why. Key questions and lines of inquiry: What is a good society? What is \"Town\" and what is \"Gown\"? What is the responsibility of an academy to the town in which it is located? What is our positionality as members of that academy?\n",
      "GLBL 6285 China's Challenge to the Global Economic Order. Hanscom Smith. In the decades after 1979, China's adherence to key tenets of the U.S.-backed liberal international economic system enabled it to achieve middle income status. After the 2008-9 global financial crisis, however, weaknesses in the U.S. model combined with China's own sustained growth increased Beijing's confidence in an alternative, state-oriented model that increasingly underpins China's foreign economic engagement. This course examines the Global Security and Belt and Road initiatives, trade, investment, and development policies, international organization advocacy, business practices, and other aspects of China's growing international economic footprint. These factors are analyzed from the perspective of China's internal dynamics, competition with the United States, and overall foreign policy goals, and are evaluated for their impact on the prevailing global economic order. The course is taught by a practitioner who spent over a decade managing U.S. Government economic policy in and on China.\n",
      "GLBL 6510 Central Banking in Emerging Economies. Subba Rao Duvvuri. Central banks which had historically operated in the background came to the forefront in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–09, playing an increasingly critical, and increasingly visible, role in supporting growth and stability across countries, regions and the world. Consequently, their policies and actions have come to acquire a much greater bearing on global macroeconomy. Although central banks around the world are broadly similar in terms of their mandates and policy instruments, emerging market central banks are different by way of the policy trade-offs they face, the degrees of freedom available to them, and the environment in which they operate. As the global economic center of gravity shifts towards the emerging world, an intelligent appreciation of emerging economy perspectives is imperative for acquiring a broad-based worldview on frontier public policy issues. In that light, the course focuses on the challenges and dilemmas of central banking in emerging markets. Drawing from international, particularly emerging market experience of the last two decades, the course prioritizes practice over theory and breadth over depth.\n",

      "GLBL 6535 Social Innovation Starter. Teresa Chahine. Students apply the ten-stage framework of the textbook Social Entrepreneurship: Building Impact Step by Step to innovate new solutions for host organizations. Host organizations are social enterprises or other social purpose organizations based globally and locally that present Yale students with a problem statement to work on over the course of one term. This could include creating new programs or products, reaching new populations, measuring the impact of existing work, creating new communications tools for existing work, or other challenges. Students gain social innovation and entrepreneurship experience and host organizations benefit from students’ problem-solving. Students from all programs and concentrations at Yale are welcome to join Jackson students in forming interdisciplinary teams to tackle social challenges.\n",
      "GLBL 6555 Global Financial Crisis. Andrew Metrick, Timothy Geithner. This course surveys the causes, events, policy responses, and aftermath of the recent global financial crisis. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive view of this major economic event within a framework that explains the dynamics of financial crises in a modern economy. The course combines lectures (many online), panel discussions with major actors from the crisis, and small group meetings. Course requirements are the preparation of four memos and a final paper with either an extended analysis of a case or a literature review for a specific topic from the syllabus. Limited enrollment.

      "GLBL 6590 Social Entrepreneurship Lab. Teresa Chahine. Social Entrepreneurship Lab is a practice-based course in which students from across campus form interdisciplinary teams to work on a social challenge of their choice. Teams include students from SOM, SPH, FES, YDS, Jackson School, and other Yale professional schools and programs. Students start by identifying a topic area of focus, then form teams based on shared interests and complementary skills. Over the course of thirteen weeks, student teams delve into understanding the challenge through root cause analysis, research on existing solutions and populations affected; then apply human centered design thinking and systems thinking to design, prototype, test, and iterate solutions. Using tools such as the theory of change, logframe, business canvas, and social marketing strategy, teams build and test their impact models, operational models, and revenue models. Readings and assignments from the textbook Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship are used to guide this journey. These include technical templates, case studies, and interviews with social entrepreneurs and thought leaders in different sectors and geographies around the world. The class meets twice a week for eighty minutes and includes in-class exercises along with social entrepreneur guests who join the class to share their experience, advice, and challenges. At the end of the semester, student teams pitch their ventures to a panel of judges including social venture funders and social entrepreneurs. Teams are encouraged, but not required, to submit their ventures to one of the campus wide startup prizes (see: city.yale.edu/funding). While there are no prerequisites, this course builds on the SOM core course Innovator, and electives including Principles of Entrepreneurship, Entrepreneurship & New Ventures, Public Health Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship, Global Social Entrepreneurship, Managing Social Enterprises, Business & the Environment Solutions. Limited enrollment. Course follows the School of Management academic calendar.\n",
      "GLBL 6610 Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies, and National Power I. Ted Wittenstein. This two-term course, featuring guest scholars and practitioners from across the university, examines how artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to alter the fundamental building blocks of world order. Machines capable of sophisticated information processing, towards the frontier of autonomy, pose tremendous opportunities for economic growth and societal well-being. Yet the potential risks also are extraordinary.  How can we build AI systems that are reliable, transparent, safe, scalable, and aligned with human values? Following an introduction to AI and survey of current research challenges, the seminar focuses on seven core areas where AI and emergent technologies already pose significant security concerns: (1) lethal autonomous weapons and the nature of conflict, (2) disinformation and the future of democracy, (3) competition and conflict in U.S.-China relations, (4) AI ethics and safety, (5) AI governance, (6) nanotechnology and quantum computing, and (7) outer-space development. For each of these sub-units, the goal is to equip aspiring leaders with requisite technical fluency, and to bridge the divide across the law, technology, and policy communities at Yale.\n",
      "GLBL 6620 Policy and Security Issues in International Macroeconomics. Marnix Amand. The objective of this course is to provide students with an intuitive but rigorous understanding of international macroeconomics and apply these insights to related policy and security issues. Given the increasingly integrated nature of global financial markets and the large speculative component of financial flows, monetary and financial policy choices in large economies can have globally destabilizing effects, often involuntary—fueling global imbalances and/or triggering crises in emerging economies—possibly voluntary e.g., sanctions. Understanding international macroeconomics is therefore relevant for a development, foreign policy, or security practitioner. Topics covered are central banks, monetary policy, domestic finance and financial regulation, exchange rate regimes, international capital flows, global imbalances, models of balance of payment crises and debt crises, financial sanctions.\n",
      "GLBL 7005 Modern Foreign Assistance and Aid Effectiveness. Alix Zwane. Official Development Assistance from members of the OECD totaled $186 billion in 2021. Other emerging donors, including China, have provided even more. This course considers the question of whether and how aid \"works\", and what this metric means. How are these resources spent and why?  The political economy of aid is surely different than in 1960, 1990 or 2002, but have our institutions kept apace? This course examines aid effectiveness from a variety of angles, considering decolonization, climate change, the rise of development finance, and great power competition. Upon completion, the student has a better understanding of the role and potential role for development in the \"3Ds\" of development, defense, and diplomacy.\n",
      "GLBL 7020 Negotiating International Agreements: The Case of Climate Change. Susan Biniaz. This class is a practical introduction to the negotiation of international agreements, with a focus on climate change. Through the climate lens, students explore cross-cutting features of international agreements, the process of international negotiations, the development of national positions, advocacy of national positions internationally, and the many ways in which differences among negotiating countries are resolved. The seminar also examines the history and substance of the climate change regime, including, inter alia, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, the 2015 Paris Agreement, and recent developments. There are two mock negotiations.\n",
      "GLBL 7030 The Future of Global Finance. Jeffrey Garten. Finance can be likened to the circulatory system of the global economy, and we focus on the past, present, and future of that system. The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political, and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators, and international organizations. Thus the course encompasses subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We take a broad view of the GFS including its history, geopolitical framework, economic foundations, and legal underpinnings. We consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long-term investments in infrastructure. We discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis is on the practice of global finance more than the theory. The course is open to graduate students throughout Yale and to seniors in Yale College. It follows the SOM academic calendar.\n",
      "GLBL 7055 Global Crises Response. Harry Thomas. With a special emphasis on the United States, this course explores how the international community responds to humanitarian crises and military interventions. We examine the roles and responsibilities of members of the diplomatic corps, senior military officials, nongovernmental organizations, and international financial organizations in order to understand the skill sets required for these organizations to be effective. Through readings, discussions, role-play, writing exercises, and other tools, we learn how organizations succeed and sometimes fail in assisting individuals and nations in peril. We examine emerging regional hot spots, with an emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We explore the challenges facing the governments, civil society organizations, and businesses in the aftermath of crises and the impact on citizens. We review the effectiveness of regional organizations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the African Union (AU) in assisting governments rebuild and stabilize their societies. We have several role-playing simulations during which students play the role of an individual or organization responsible for briefing counterparts on key events.\n",
      "GLBL 7070 Russian Intelligence, Information Warfare, and Social Media. Asha Rangappa. This course explores the evolution of information warfare as a national security threat to the United States and democratic countries around the world. Beginning with the KGB’s use of \"active measures\" during the Cold War, the course looks at how propaganda and disinformation campaigns became central to the Putin regime and how social media has facilitated their expansion. We examine the psychology of disinformation and how media \"bubbles\" and existing social fissures in the United States, such as racism and political polarization, provide ripe vulnerabilities for exploitation by foreign actors. Using Russia’s efforts in U.S. presidential elections, during COVID, and in Ukraine as examples of this new form of warfare, students explore potential policy solutions in the realm of Internet regulation, civic education, media literacy, and human \"social capital\" as defenses against this growing threat. Guest speakers with expertise in Russian intelligence, information warfare, psychology, and other disciplines complement the discussion.\n",
      "GLBL 7095 Sexuality, Gender, Health, and Human Rights. Ali Miller. This course explores the application of human rights perspectives and practices to issues in regard to sexuality, gender, and health. Through reading, interactive discussion, paper presentation, and occasional outside speakers, students learn the tools and implications of applying rights and law to a range of sexuality and health-related topics. The overall goal is twofold: to engage students in the world of global sexual health and rights policy making as a field of social justice and public health action; and to introduce them to conceptual tools that can inform advocacy and policy formation and evaluation. Class participation, a book review, an OpEd, and a final paper required. Enrollment is  limited and permission of the instructor required. Also LAW 20568, course follows the Law School calendar.\n",
      "GLBL 7115 Designing and Reforming Democracy. David Froomkin, Ian Shapiro. What is the best electoral system? Should countries try to limit the number of political parties? Should chief executives be independently elected? Should legislatures have powerful upper chambers? Should courts have the power to strike down democratically enacted laws? These and related questions are discussed in this course. Throughout the term, we engage in an ongoing dialogue with the Federalist Papers, contrasting the Madisonian constitutional vision with subsequent insights from democratic theory and empirical political science across the democratic world. Where existing practices deviate from what would be best, we also attend to the costs of these sub-optimal systems and types of reforms that would improve them.\n",
      "GLBL 7125 Human Rights in the Americas and the Inter-American System. James Cavallaro. This course provides an in-depth introduction and overview of the main human rights challenges in the Americas through the study of the context leading to abuse, as well as the engagement of the Inter-American Human Rights System (IAHRS). We begin with readings focusing on the social conflicts, inequalities, and other social factors underlying situations of rights abuse. We then turn to the IAHRS, evaluating its doctrine and practice on particular rights, as well as through a review of case studies of situations of conflict and rights abuse and the engagement of the system. The Inter-American Human Rights system is composed of two bodies: the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The seminar evaluates the jurisprudence and practice of both bodies. The course also examines the engagement, obstacles, and opportunities the system provides for civil society groups, victims, and advocates. Class sessions consider not only the norms of the system but also its internal dynamics: these present both challenges and opportunities for advocates. In addition, we explore the influence of the system, evaluating the impact of decisions and interventions by IAHRS bodies. Students also consider the Inter-American system from a comparative perspective, comparing rulings, implementation, and impact to those of regional and universal counterparts.\n",
      "GLBL 7135 Just Energy Transitions. Andre de Ruyter. The necessity of accelerating decarbonisation of coal-based power systems to counteract anthropomorphic global warming is obvious from a rational and scientific perspective. Implementing this in practice is a major challenge having regard to the incumbency of coal-fired generation. In this course, using a combined framework of the energy trilemma and an ever-narrowing focus on geopolitical, regional, and local issues, including matters such as resource nationalism and perceived global iniquities, CBAM and historical emission and growth patterns, are explored. At an energy-system level, the need for dispatchable electricity to maintain a constant frequency on the grid, additional storage, and grid strengthening are explored to illustrate the complexity of greening a fossil-dominated electricity system. At a social level, challenges with reskilling and upskilling coal value chain workers are considered, as well as the challenges of legacy assets, and the cost of decommissioning and rehabilitation. A South African JET project is considered to understand the challenges at national, regional, and grassroots levels; how incumbent value chains have legitimate concerns; and what ameliorative steps can be taken to ensure that the transition is as just as possible. The impacts on employment, public health, water consumption, and regional development are considered. Deployment of renewable energy does not always coincide with the location of coal-fired assets and transmission grids, further complicating efforts to render the transition a just one.\n",
      "GLBL 7150 Managing the Clean Energy Transition: Contemporary Energy and Climate Change Policy Making. Paul Simons. This seminar explores the principal challenges facing key global economies in managing their respective transitions to a clean energy future and the goals of the Paris agreement, while simultaneously meeting their energy security needs and keeping their economies competitive. By the end of the course, students should be familiar with key features of the global energy and climate change architecture, principal challenges facing policy makers around the world in balancing energy and climate goals, and prospects for the development of key fuels and technologies as we advance toward a net zero emissions world. After a solid grounding in energy and climate scenarios, the course explores the role of electricity and renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean energy technologies in the clean energy transition; corporate and financial sector climate initiatives; economic tools including carbon pricing; and the shifting roles of fossil fuels in the clean energy transition.\n",
      "GLBL 7165 Characterizing Complexity: Introduction to Earth System Science for Public Policy Professionals. Jessica Seddon. Environmental change is accelerating. Ongoing shifts in temperature, rainfall, storm intensity, seasonal patterns, species ranges and interactions, ecosystem health, and more already represent a profound shift in humans’ \"operating environment,\" to borrow a phrase from the authors of the planetary boundary’s framework. And the science suggests that the pace will not let up. If anything, we can expect more sudden and irreversible changes—tipping points—that will affect economies, polities, and societies as well as human health and wellbeing. This course seeks to build public policy professionals’ familiarity with policy-relevant aspects of earth system dynamics. It is no substitute for the kind of deeper collaboration between specialists that is needed for effective environmental governance, but it provides a foundation for identifying and framing such partnerships. This is a new and experimental course that attempts to address a gap that the instructor has encountered all too often in her twenty-five years working on the intersection of economics, public policy, and efforts to limit environmental damage. It draws on her interdisciplinary and global network of collaborators to attempt to provide selected depth as well as breadth.\n",
      "GLBL 7205 Internationalism versus Isolationism in US Foreign Policy. Leslie Tsou. Should the United States act as the world’s security force? Should it stay out of world events? Or is there a balance between these two extremes and, if so, what factors should be considered in determining this balance? This course examines these questions primarily through the lens of the United States' engagement in the Middle East (including Iraq, Iran, Libya, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and Saudi Arabia).  We will consider these cases from the perspectives of both the United States and the affected countries, taking into account multiple factors including security, business and economic interests, and human rights. Students choose one real life example to examine in depth; class presentations inform a final written paper.\n",
      "GLBL 7260 GSE India: Global Social Entrepreneurship. Asha Ghosh, Tony Sheldon. Launched in 2008 at the Yale School of Management, the Global Social Entrepreneurship (GSE) course links teams of Yale students with social enterprises based in India. GSE is committed to channeling the skills of Yale students to help Indian organizations expand their reach and impact on \"bottom of the pyramid\" communities. Yale students partner with mission-driven social entrepreneurs (SEs) to focus on a specific management challenge that the student/SE teams work together to address during the term. GSE has worked with thirty leading and emerging Indian social enterprises engaged in economic development, sustainable energy, women’s empowerment, education, environmental conservation, and affordable housing. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, financing social businesses, the role of civil society in India, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. Enrollment is by application only. Also MGT 529.\n",
      "GLBL 7280 Leadership. Christopher Fussell. This course is designed for students wanting to deeply reflect on what it means to be a leader, and to help them prepare for leading others in their future. Amongst the many pressures of the role, leaders affect the lives of those they lead, influence the health of the organization they oversee, and hold an important role in advancing social progress. Many learn these realities through trial and error but are rarely given the time to consider what leadership truly entails and how we, as individual leaders, will handle the challenges that lie ahead.  From heading up a small team to running a major organization, leadership is often an isolating and uncertain position, but is also full of opportunity to positively impact others, and to advance society broadly. Leadership is challenging, exciting, and sometimes terrifying; but most importantly, it is a choice to which one must recommit every day. This course is designed to offer a foundation in the practice of leadership for students who want to take on these challenges in their future. The course is divided into three main sections: historic perspectives on leadership, leadership in context, and personal reflections on leadership. Students finish the semester with a foundational understanding of leadership models throughout history, a range of case studies to refer to in the future, and most importantly, a personal framework that can be applied and expanded throughout their journey and growth as a leader. Students do not leave with all the answers they need to conquer the countless challenges that leaders face, but they instead leave with an understanding of how leaders work, every day, to improve themselves and better the lives of those they lead.\n",
      "GLBL 7290 Ethical Choices in Public Leadership. Eric Braverman. All public leaders must make choices that challenge their code of ethics. Sometimes, a chance of life or death is literally at stake: how and when should a leader decide to let some people die, or explicitly ask people to die to give others a chance to live? At other times, while life or death may not be at stake, a leader must still decide difficult issues: when to partner with unsavory characters, when to admit failure, when to release information or make choices transparent. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and continued instability around the world all make clearer than ever the consequences of decisions in one community that can affect the entire world. This interdisciplinary seminar draws on perspectives from law, management, and public policy in exploring how leaders develop their principles, respond when their principles fail or conflict, and make real-world choices when, in fact, there are no good choices. Both permission of the instructor and application are required. Attendance at first session is mandatory.\n",
      "GLBL 7535 Intelligence, Espionage, and American Foreign Policy. Ted Wittenstein. The discipline, theory, and practice of intelligence; the relationship of intelligence to American foreign policy and national security decision-making.

Case studies of intelligence successes and failures from World War II to the present.\n",
      "GLBL 7575 The Craft of Strategic Intelligence. Andrew Makridis. Intelligence work is both art and a science—with a little random chance thrown in. This is often made most clear when dealing with intelligence on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and national policymaking. In this course students learn: the historical development of American intelligence, understand the role of various intelligence collection techniques, understand how the intelligence mission relates to national security, and understand intelligence successes and failures all through the lens of WMD threats from the Cold War to today. The course relies heavily on actual case studies (and intelligence professionals who worked those cases) to make key points on the insights strategic intelligence can provide and its limitations. The final class exercise is to write a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)—the Intelligence Community’s authoritative assessment on intelligence related to a key national security issue.\n",

We focus on the ways in which short forms not only challenge our understanding of literature and philosophy, but also interact with a wide range of other fields of knowledge like medicine, natural science, law, and history. By considering the possibilities of these mobile and dynamic texts, we explore their power to change how we think about and act in the world. What can be said in an anecdote, a case study, or a novella that could not be said otherwise? How can short forms illuminate the relationship between the literary and the everyday? How might these texts transform our relationship to the short forms that we interact with in our own lives?\n",
      "GMAN 279 Romanticism: Poetics, Politics, and Economy. Anja Lemke. The epoch of Romanticism, situated between the French Revolution and the Restoration, is as long (ca. 1790-ca. 1830) as it is complex. Early romantics such as Schlegel, Hardenberg or (the young) Tieck seem to respond to completely different problems than for example authors like E.T.A. Hoffmann, Clemens Brentano, Eichendorff or Bettine von Arnim. Their texts provide an example of the various ways in which literature around 1800 deals with the modern experience of contingency, with social and epistemological differentiation, and political shock, and the poetic, aesthetic and genre-theoretical complexity that emerges from this process. The seminar explores this by examining key concepts of Romanticism – especially of early romantic aesthetics - such as transcendental poetry, irony, exponentiation, arabesque, the fragmentary and the (self-)reflexive, as well as considerations of imagination, perception, and sign theory, and by linking them to romantic positions in the field of philosophy, political and social theory and economics. We discuss programmatic writings, theoretical notes, and literary texts in different genres.\n",

We in turn pursue the implications of Aristotle's notion of life by engaging with contemporary philosophical discussions of death that take their point of departure in Epicurus (Nagel, Williams, Scheffler). We conclude by analyzing Heidegger's notion of constitutive mortality, in order to make explicit what is implicit in the form of the soul in Aristotle.\n",
      "GMAN 290 Politics of Performance. The stage is, and always has been, a political space.

The stage also delineates the limits of representation for democratic societies (Rousseau), as it offers the space for experimentation and new modes of being together, being ensemble. The stage also raises the question of its own condition of possibility and the networks it depends on (Jackson). This course revisits the history of German and German speaking theatre since the Enlightenment, and discusses the stage in its relationship to war, the nation state, the social question, femicide and gender politics, the Holocaust, globalization, and 21st century migration. Readings include works by G.E. Lessing, Friedrich Schiller, Hugo v. Hofmannstahl, Georg Büchner, Peter Weiss, Ida Fink, Dea Lohar, Elfriede Jelinek, Christoph Schlingensief, Heiner Müller, and Elsa Bernstein.\n",
      "GMAN 310 “Sprachkrise”—Philosophies & Language Crises. Sophie Schweiger. The crisis of language predates the invention of ChatGPT (who may or may not have helped write this syllabus). This course delves into the concept of language crises and its long history from a philosophical and literary perspective, examining how crises of language are represented in literature and how they reflect broader philosophical questions about language, identity, and power. We explore different philosophical approaches to language, such as the history of language and philology (Herder, Humboldt, Nietzsche), structuralism and post-structuralism (Saussure), analytical and pragmatic philosophies (Wittgenstein), phenomenology and deconstruction (Heidegger), and analyze how these theories shape our understanding of language while simultaneously evoking its crisis. The course also examines how such language crises are represented and produced in literature and the arts; how authors and artists approach the complexities of language loss, and how crises help birth alternative systems of signification. Through close readings of literary texts by Hofmannsthal, Musil, Bachmann, et. al., we analyze the symbolic and metaphorical significance of language crises, as well as the ethical and political implications of language loss for (cultural) identity. Experimental use of language such as DaDa artwork, performance cultures, and \"Sprachspiel\" poetry by the \"Wiener Gruppe,\" as well as contemporary KI/AI literature, further complement the theoretical readings. By exploring language crises through the lens of philosophy and literature, we gain a deeper understanding of the role of language—and its many crises—in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our communities.\n",
      "GMAN 355 German Film from 1945 to the Present. Fatima Naqvi. Trauma, gender, media, transnationalism, terrorism, migration, precarity, neoliberalism, and environmental ethics are the issues we study in films from the German-speaking world. We begin in the immediate post-war period: How does the Second World War and its aftermath inflect these films? How does gender play an increasingly important role in the fiction films under discussion? What new collective identities do films articulate in the course of the politicized period from the late 1960s into the late 1970s, when home-grown terrorism contests the category of the West German nation? How do the predominant concerns shift with the passage of time and with the changing media formats? What is the role of genre in representing transnational problems like migration after 2000? How do economic issues come to the fore in the precarious economic conditions shown? When does violence seem like an  answer to political, economic, and social pressures and the legacies of colonialism? Particular attention is paid to film aesthetics. Films include those by Julian Radlmaier, Hubert Sauper, Sudabeh Mortezai, Fatih Akin, Wolfgang Staudte, Alexander Kluge, Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Schroeter, Harun Farocki, Michael Haneke, Christian Petzold, Jessica Hausner, Mara Mattuschka, Ulrich Seidl, Nikolaus Geyrhalter, among others.

      "GMAN 515 Zählen und Erzählen: On the Relation Between Mathematics and Literature. Anja Lemke. Mathematical and literary practices of signs have numerous connections, and despite current debates on digital humanities, algorithm and the \"end of the book\", the relation between calculus and writing can be traced back to around 3000 BC, when the graphé was split up into figure and character. The seminar explores this relationship by focusing on four different fields, which can be discussed separately but do exhibit numerous overlappings: a) Leibniz’ invention of infinitesimal calculus and its relation to the idea of narration from the Baroque to romanticism through to the twentieth century novel, (b) the relation between probability calculus, statistics, and novel writing in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, (c) the role of cypher for aesthetic and poetic questions starting with Schiller’s Letters on the esthetic education of men, to Robert Walser’s Jakob von Gunten, and Jenny Erpenpeck’s The old child, and (d) the economic impact of computation on poetic concepts, e.g. the role of double entry bookkeeping or models of circulation in romantic theories of money and signs. We discuss Leibniz’ Theodizee, texts on the infinitesimal calculus and his concept of an ars combinatoria, novels like The Fortunatus, Novalis’s Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Stifter’s \"The gentle law\", Gustav Freiytag’s Debit and Credit, and Musil’s Man without content, Novalis’s notes on mathematical questions of his time, and economic texts such as Adam Müller’s Attempt on a theory of money.\n",

      "GMAN 617 Psychoanalysis: Key Conceptual Differences between Freud and Lacan I. Moira Fradinger. This is the first section of a year-long seminar (second section: CPLT 914) designed to introduce the discipline of psychoanalysis through primary sources, mainly from the Freudian and Lacanian corpuses but including late twentieth-century commentators and contemporary interdisciplinary conversations. We rigorously examine key psychoanalytic concepts that students have heard about but never had the chance to study. Students gain proficiency in what has been called \"the language of psychoanalysis,\" as well as tools for critical practice in disciplines such as literary criticism, political theory, film studies, gender studies, theory of ideology, psychology medical humanities, etc. We study concepts such as the unconscious, identification, the drive, repetition, the imaginary, fantasy, the symbolic, the real, and jouissance. A central goal of the seminar is to disambiguate Freud's corpus from Lacan's reinvention of it. We do not come to the \"rescue\" of Freud. We revisit essays that are relevant for contemporary conversations within the international psychoanalytic community. We include only a handful of materials from the Anglophone schools of psychoanalysis developed in England and the US. This section pays special attention to Freud's \"three\" (the ego, superego, and id) in comparison to Lacan's \"three\" (the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real). CPLT 914 devotes, depending on the interests expressed by the group, the last six weeks to special psychoanalytic topics such as sexuation, perversion, psychosis, anti-asylum movements, conversations between psychoanalysis and neurosciences and artificial intelligence, the current pharmacological model of mental health, and/or to specific uses of psychoanalysis in disciplines such as film theory, political philosophy, and the critique of ideology. Apart from Freud and Lacan, we will read work by Georges Canguilhem, Roman Jakobson, Victor Tausk, Émile Benveniste, Valentin Volosinov, Guy Le Gaufey, Jean Laplanche, Étienne Balibar, Roberto Esposito, Wilfred Bion, Félix Guattari, Markos Zafiropoulos, Franco Bifo Berardi, Barbara Cassin, Renata Salecl, Maurice Godelier, Alenka Zupančič, Juliet Mitchell, Jacqueline Rose, Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing, Eric Kandel, and Lera Boroditsky among others. No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis is needed. Starting out from basic questions, we study how psychoanalysis, arguably, changed the way we think of human subjectivity. Graduate students from all departments and schools on campus are welcome. The final assignment is due by the end of the spring term and need not necessarily take the form of a twenty-page paper. Taught in English. Materials can be provided to cover the linguistic range of the group.\n",
      "GMAN 646 Rise of the European Novel. Katie Trumpener, Rudiger Campe. In the eighteenth century, the novel became a popular literary form in many parts of Europe. Yet now-standard narratives of its \"rise\" often offer a temporally and linguistically foreshortened view. This seminar examines key early modern novels in a range of European languages, centered on the dialogue between highly influential eighteenth-century British and French novels (Montesquieu, Defoe, Sterne, Diderot, Laclos, Edgeworth). We begin by considering a sixteenth-century Spanish picaresque life history (Lazarillo de Tormes) and Madame de Lafayette’s seventeenth-century secret history of French court intrigue; contemplate a key sentimental Goethe novella; and end with Romantic fiction (an Austen novel, a Kleist novella, Pushkin’s historical novel fragment). These works raise important issues about cultural identity and historical experience, the status of women (including as readers and writers), the nature of society, the vicissitudes of knowledge—and novelistic form. We also examine several major literary-historical accounts of the novel’s generic evolution, audiences, timing, and social function, and historiographical debates about the novel’s rise (contrasting English-language accounts stressing the novel’s putatively British genesis, and alternative accounts sketching a larger European perspective). The course gives special emphasis to the improvisatory, experimental character of early modern novels, as they work to reground fiction in the details and reality of contemporary life. Many epistolary, philosophical, sentimental, and Gothic novels present themselves as collections of \"documents\"—letters, diaries, travelogues, confessions—carefully assembled, impartially edited, and only incidentally conveying stories as well as information. The seminar explores these novels’ documentary ambitions; their attempt to touch, challenge, and change their readers; and their paradoxical influence on \"realist\" conventions (from the emergence of omniscient, impersonal narrators to techniques for describing time and place).\n",
      "GMAN 701 Theories of Freedom: Schelling and Hegel. Paul North. In 1764 Immanuel Kant noted in the margin of one of his published books that evil was \"the subjection of one being under the will of another,\" a sign that good was coming to mean freedom. But what is freedom? Starting with early reference to Kant, we study two major texts on freedom in post-Kantian German Idealism, Schelling's 1809 Philosophical Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom and Related Objects and Hegel's 1820 Elements of the Philosophy of Right.\n",

      "HIST 002 Myth, Legend, and History in New England. This seminar explores the complex and multi-faceted process of remembering and representing the past, using the New England region as our laboratory and drawing on the resources of Yale and the surrounding region for our tools.  Human events are evanescent—as soon as they happen, they disappear.  Yet they live on in many forms, embodied in physical artifacts and the built environment, converted to songs, stories, and legends, inscribed in written records of a thousand sorts, depicted in graphic images from paintings and sketches to digital photographs and video.  From these many sources people form and reform their understanding of the past.  In this seminar, we examine a series of iconic events and patterns deeply embedded in New England’s past and analyze the contested processes whereby historians, artists, poets, novelists, and other \"remembrancers\" of the past have attempted to do this essential work.\n",

We study past forms of inequality and importantly, how societies explained and justified the existence of often pronounced inequality, and then turn to the question what sustains inequality today. Topics covered are inequalities of income, of banking and money, housing, health, education, opportunity, among others. Each of these topics have readings that allow us to trace back the history of such issues as well as readings that deal with contemporary expressions of the same problem. We pay particular attention to the role that discrimination on the basis of race and gender plays in all of this.\n",

Through careful reading of primary sources, students take a critical look at convivencia as both historical concept and practice. To what degree did tolerance exist in medieval Spain? And perhaps more critically, what do religious interactions in the distant past tell us about the possibilities for religious tolerance in the future.\n",

This question has plagued the United States since its inception. Most countries, in constructing their national identity, point to shared language, culture, or ethnicity. The United States, on the other hand, has been called a \"nation of immigrants,\" a \"melting pot,\" or a \"mosaic.\" These terms seek to describe how disparate groups of people from all over the globe have come together to form a nation. In this course, students grapple with questions of who has been considered \"American\" at different points in U.S. history, how the boundaries of this U.S national community have been policed, and why those boundaries have changed over time to allow some to become American while continuing to exclude others.\n",

      "HIST 056 Women Who Ruled. Winston Hill. This course examines queens who ruled over hereditary monarchies in their own right. Each week spotlights a different queen or set of related queens. With the use of secondary works and primary sources, students gain some familiarity with the queens themselves, their struggles to use and retain power, and the cultures in which those queens were embedded. Over the duration of the course, students form a basic idea of what queenship has entailed across cultures, while simultaneously discovering how queenship varied in different cultures and material circumstances. The course thereby not only investigates queenship, but also serves as an introduction to the temporal, spatial, and conceptual breadth of world history. And, through watching recent film and television depictions of these queens, students come to grips with the problem of historical memory and the uses (or abuses) to which history can be put.\n",
      "HIST 059 Asian Americans and STEM. Eun-Joo Ahn. As both objects of study and agents of discovery, Asian Americans have played an important yet often unseen role in fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in the U.S. Now more than ever, there is a need to rethink and educate students on science’s role in society and its interface with society. This course unites the humanities fields of Asian American history and American Studies with the STEM fields of medicine, physics, and computer science to explore the ways in which scientific practice has been shaped by U.S. histories of imperialism and colonialism, migration and racial exclusion, domestic and international labor and economics, and war. The course also explores the scientific research undertaken in these fields and delves into key scientific principles and concepts to understand the impact of such work on the lives of Asians and Asian Americans, and how the migration of people may have impacted the migration of ideas and scientific progress. Using case students, students engage with fundamental scientific concepts in these fields. They explore key roles Asians and Asian Americans had in the development in science and technology in the United States and around the world as well as the impact of state policies regarding the migration of technical labor and the concerns over brain drains. Students also examine diversity and inclusion in the context of the experiences of Asians and Asian Americans in STEM.\n",
      "HIST 068 The Global Gandhi: Histories of Nonviolent Resistance. Sunil Amrith. At a time of rising violence and polarization both within and between nations, what can we learn from the history of nonviolent political action? This course examines the life and the afterlives of Mohandas (\"Mahatma\") Gandhi, who led India’s struggle for independence from British colonial rule. Gandhi’s practice of nonviolent struggle was shaped by multiple influences—by reading Thoreau and Tolstoy, by his experiences as a migrant Indian lawyer and journalist in South Africa, as well as by multiple Indian religious traditions. In turn, after his death Gandhi became an icon and an inspiration for political movements around the world, including the Civil Rights movement in the US and the anti-Apartheid struggle in South Africa.\n",
      "HIST 098 Little Ice Ages: Climate Crises and Human History. Fabian Drixler. Anthropogenic global warming is one of the defining crises of our time. Before the 20th century, it was cooling and drought that posed the greatest challenges to human flourishing. Temperatures could drop for centuries, such as in the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300-1850). Volcanic winters typically lasted only a year or two but rattled the ecological foundations of many societies. Through a focus on such periods of climatic disruption, this seminar serves as an introduction to the broader study of climate history. This is a rapidly developing field that combines methodologies across many disciplines, from ice core analysis and volcanology to tree rings and the analysis of written records. Our readings are often authored by multi-disciplinary teams, but our focus is on how historians understand the past interactions of human beings and the climate. The scope of the course is global and ranges from the collapse of ancient societies to the prospects for (deliberately) engineering the climate of the future. Our temporal center of gravity is the early modern period─already exquisitely documented but still highly vulnerable to changes in temperature.\n",
      "HIST 101J History of Incarceration in the U.S.. Regina Kunzel. This course explores the history of incarceration in the U.S. over more than two centuries.

      "HIST 111J Race and Mental Health in New Haven. Marco Ramos. Recent scholarship in the humanities has critically examined the violence that the mental health care system has inflicted on marginalized communities in the United States. This advanced research seminar explores race, mental health, and harm through the local history of New Haven. We interrogate the past and present of Yale University’s relationship to the surrounding community by unearthing the history of \"community mental health\" at Yale in the 1960s. In particular, the seminar is built around a newly discovered archive in the Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC), an institution that was developed as an urban renewal project that displaced citizens from their homes and jobs in the Hill Neighborhood. The archive details, among other things, the contentious relationship between Yale University and activist community organizations in New Haven during this period, including the Black Panthers and Hill Neighborhood Parents Association. Students develop original research papers based on archival materials. The seminar touches on historical methodology, archiving practices, and how to circulate knowledge about community healing and harm within and beyond the academy. Organizers in New Haven will be invited to reflect on our work at the end of the seminar.\n",
      "HIST 112 \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy:\" Paranoia and Conspiracy Theories in 20th and 21st C. America. In this course we examine the development and growth of conspiracy theories in American politics and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We look at texts from a variety of different analytical and political traditions to develop an understanding of how and why conspiracy theories develop, their structural dynamics, and how they function as a narrative. We examine a variety of different conspiracy theories and conspiratorial groups from across the political spectrum, but we pay particular attention to anti-Semitism as a foundational form of conspiracy theorizing, as well as the particular role of conspiracy theories in far-right politics, ranging from the John Birch Society in the 1960s to the Tea Party, QAnon, and beyond in the 21st century. We also look at how real conspiracies shape and reinforce conspiracy theorizing as a mode of thought, and formulate ethical answers on how to address conspiracy as a mode of politics.\n",

      "HIST 123 Muslims in the United States. Zareena Grewal. Since 9/11, cases of what has been termed \"home-grown terrorism\" have cemented the fear that \"bad\" Islam is not just something that exists far away, in distant lands. As a result, there has been an urgent interest to understand who American Muslims are by officials, experts, journalists, and the public. Although Muslims have been part of America’s story from its founding, Muslims have alternated from an invisible minority to the source of national moral panics, capturing national attention during political crises, as a cultural threat or even a potential fifth column. Today the stakes are high to understand what kinds of meanings and attachments connect Muslims in America to the Muslim world and to the US as a nation. Over the course of the semester, students grapple with how to define and apply the slippery concept of diaspora to different dispersed Muslim populations in the US, including racial and ethnic diasporas, trading diasporas, political diasporas, and others. By focusing on a range of communities-in-motion and a diverse set of cultural texts, students explore the ways mobility, loss, and communal identity are conceptualized by immigrants, expatriates, refugees, guest-workers, religious seekers, and exiles. To this end, we read histories, ethnographies, essays, policy papers, novels, poetry, memoirs; we watch documentary and fictional films; we listen to music, speeches, spoken word performances, and prayers. Our aim is to deepen our understanding of the multiple meanings and conceptual limits of homeland and diaspora for Muslims in America, particularly in the Age of Terror.\n",

      "HIST 139J Fetal Histories: Pregnancy, Life, and Personhood in the American Cultural Imagination. Megann Licskai. In our twenty-first-century historical moment, the fetus is a powerful political and cultural symbol. One’s fetal politics likely predicts a lot about how they live their life, vote, worship, and even about how they understand themselves. How, then, has the fetus come to carry the cultural significance that it does? Are there other ways one might think of the fetus? And what is happening in the background when we center the fetus up front? This course examines the many cultural meanings of the fetus in American life: from a clump of cells, to a beloved family member, to political litmus test, and considers the way that these different meanings are connected to questions of human and civil rights, gender relations, bodily autonomy, and political life. We look at the history of our very idea of the fetus and consider how we got here. Each of us may have a different idea of what the fetus is, but every one of those ideas has a particular history. We work to understand those histories, their contexts, and their possible implications for the future of American political life.\n",

      "HIST 142J Collecting Bodies: Historical Approaches to Specimen Collection. Megann Licskai. Why is there a room full of brains in the basement of Yale’s medical school, and why does it welcome hundreds of visitors every year? What compels us about the macabre spectacle of human remains, and what is their place in medical history? What kinds of stories can and should a museum space tell, and what are the multivalent functions of a collection like this in a university setting? Using Yale’s Cushing Center as a center of discussion, this class examines the ethics of collecting and viewing human specimens. The course ties these practices to histories of colonialism, racism, medicine, anthropology, and natural history while considering the cultural specificity of the collectors and the collected. Students analyze the kinds of stories that museum spaces can tell and imagine possibilities for ethical storytelling through both academic analysis and creative engagement. In doing so, we prioritize hands-on historical work while reading theory to address broader ethical and epistemological questions.\n",

      "HIST 149J A History of the Border Wall:  From the Frontier to the Border Wall in US History. Ever since the US’s founding, the idea of an open and ever-expanding frontier has been central to United States identity. Symbolizing a future of endless promise, the frontier made possible the United States’ belief in itself as an exceptional nation—democratic, individualistic, forward-looking. Today, the country has a new symbol: the border wall. This course focuses on both the current crisis at the U.S.-Mexican border, which has consumed the country’s attention and challenged its public morality and national identity, and the long history that has led to the crisis. After an introductory period focused mostly on the history of the U.S. border (with indigenous peoples, Spain, and Mexico), we alternate between issues pertaining to the current moment and the larger historical context. We read about and discuss events of the moment, related to the immediate causes of migration, the rise of nativism in the U.S., along with calls for building a border wall, family separation and child detention policies, and the activity of the Border Patrol and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, as we continue to set the current crisis in historical context.\n",

Many of the key challenges the world faces today have their origins in imperial structures and policies, from wars and terror to racism and environmental destruction. This seminar looks at the transformation empires and imperialisms went through from the middle part of the nineteenth century and up to today. Our discussions center on how and why imperialisms moved from strategies of territorial occupation and raw exploitation, the \"smash and grab\" version of empire, and on to policies of racial hierarchies, social control and reform, and colonial concepts of civilizational progress, many of which are still with us today. The seminar also covers anti-colonial resistance, revolutionary organizations and ideas, and processes of decolonization.\n",

This course explores the history of utopia and the ways in which societies at different times defined and conceived alternative or ideal worlds. It explores the relationship between real historical conditions and the models of utopia that were elaborated. By examining classic texts like Plato and Thomas More, as well as fictional accounts, students discuss the relationship between utopias and dystopias. The course also discusses how the crises of the last century, with WWII, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the difficulties of global capitalism provoked what some people now consider to be a crisis of utopian thought or, a moment of a redefinition of utopias as more pragmatic, inclusive, and egalitarian of societies.\n",

      "HIST 236J Truth and Sedition. William Klein. The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of \"truth\" change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes implicates modes of knowing? Are there types of truth that any regime would—or should—find dangerous? What are the possible motives and pathways for self-censorship?  We begin with the revolt of the Hebrews against polytheistic Egypt and the Socratic questioning of democracy, and end with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes. We consider these events and texts, and their reverberations and reversals in history, in relation to select analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, Chomsky, Waldron, Zizek, and Xu Zhongrun.\n",

      "HIST 240 Sexual Minorities from Plato to the Enlightenment. Igor De Souza. This interdisciplinary course surveys the history of homosexuality from a cross-cultural, comparative  perspective. Students study contexts where homosexuality and sodomy were categorized, regulated, and persecuted and examine ancient and medieval constructions of same-sex desire in light of post-modern developments, challenging ideas around what is considered normal and/or natural. Ultimately, we ask: what has changed, and what has remained the same, in the history of homosexuality? What do gays and lesbians today have in common with pre-modern sodomites? Can this history help us ground or rethink our sexual selves and identities? Primary and secondary historical sources, some legal and religious sources, and texts in intellectual history are studied. Among the case studies for the course are ancient attitudes among Jews, early Christians, and Greeks; Christian theologians of the Middle Ages; Renaissance Florence; the Inquisition in Iberia; colonial Latin America; and the Enlightenment’s condemnation of sodomy by Montesquieu and Voltaire, and its defense by Bentham.\n",

This seminar explores the history of right-wing political thought from the late eighteenth century to the present, with an emphasis on the role played by religious and pagan traditions. This course seeks to answer the question, what constitutes the right? What are the central philosophical, religious, and pagan, principles of those groups associated with this designation? How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies. While the course is limited to the modern period, it adopts a global perspective to better understand the full scope of right-wing politics.\n",

      "HIST 293 Ten Eurasian Cities. Nari Shelekpayev. This course explores histories and identities of ten cities in Northern and Central Eurasia. Its approach is based on an assumption that studying cities is crucial for an understanding of how societies developed on the territory of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and post-Soviet states. The course is structured around the study of ten cities—Kyiv, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Odesa, Baku, Magnitogorsk, Kharkiv, Tashkent, Semey (former Semipalatinsk), and Nur-Sultan (former Astana)—that are located on the territory of modern Ukraine, Russia, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. We study these cities through the prism of various scholarly approaches, as well as historical and visual sources. Literary texts are used not only as a means to illustrate certain historical processes but as artifacts that were instrumental in creating the identity of these cities within and beyond their territories. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquaint all participants with the dynamics of social, cultural, and political development of the ten Eurasian cities, their urban layout and architectural features. The course also provides an overview of basic conceptual approaches to the study of cities and ongoing urbanization in Northern and Central Eurasia.\n",

What was the role of women and the position of ethnic minorities in the fledgling nation-states? As the year 2021 marks the bicentennial of the Greek Revolution of 1821, special attention is given to the intricate links forged between Greek revolutionary intellectuals and their peers in Europe and other continents\n",

Nor is it unified by a shared geography or by the prevalence of a common language or ethnic group. Yet Latin America does, obviously, exist. It is a region forged from the merging of diverse cultures, historical experiences, and processes of resistance. This course provides an overview of Latin America and the Caribbean from the 16th century up to the present. While the class aims to provide students with an understanding of the region, due to time constraints, it focuses primarily on the experiences and histories of selected countries. The course introduces students to some of the most important debates about the region’s history, politics, society, and culture. The course follows a chronological structure while also highlighting thematic questions. Drawing on academic readings, films, music, art, literature, testimony, oral histories, and writings from local voices the class explores the political transformation of the region, as well as topics related to ethnic and racial identity, revolution, social movements, religion, violence, military rule, democracy, transition to democracy, and migration.\n",
      "HIST 311 Egypt of the Pharaohs. Joseph Manning, Nadine Moeller. Egypt was among the first centralized territorial states in the world, and, because Egyptian history offers us 4000 years of institutional development and change, the focus of this course is on the long-term development of the ancient Egyptian state, its institutions, and its culture.

      "HIST 345J Gender and the State in Latin America and the Caribbean. Anne Eller. This seminar offers an introduction to historical constructions of gender identity and gendered polities in Latin America and the Caribbean from pre-colonial native societies into the twentieth century. We begin with an analysis of gender in the Inca empire and several lowland societies, focusing on spirituality, agriculture, and land tenure particularly. The arrival of Spanish colonialism brings tremendous and complex transformations to the societies that we consider; we analyze discourses of honor, as well as how various subjects navigated the violence and the transforming colonial state. Our readings turn to Caribbean slavery, where studies of gendered experiences of enslavement and resistance have grown considerably in recent decades. Building on these insights, we analyze the gendered experiences of abolition and inclusion into contentious new Latin American and Caribbean nations of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, we consider some of the most salient analyses of the growth of state power, including dictatorships, in multiple sites. Throughout we maintain an eye for principle questions about representation, reproduction, inclusion, political consciousness, sexuality, migration, kinship, and revolutionary struggle through a gendered lens.\n",

      "HIST 364 Modern China. Today’s China is one of the world’s great powers, and the relationship between the United States and China is one of the most consequential of our times. Yet we cannot understand China without examining the historical context of its rise. How have the Chinese searched for modernity in the recent past? How were the dramatic changes of the late imperial period, the twentieth century, and after experienced by the Chinese people? This introductory course examines the political, social, and cultural revolutions that have shaped Chinese history since late imperial times. The emphasis of this course is on the analysis of primary sources in translation and the discussion of these texts within the context of the broader historical narrative. It assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.\n",
      "HIST 367 Bureaucracy in Africa: Revolution, Genocide, and Apartheid. Jonny Steinberg. A study of three major episodes in modern African history characterized by ambitious projects of bureaucratically driven change—apartheid and its aftermath, Rwanda’s genocide and post-genocide reconstruction, and Ethiopia’s revolution and its long aftermath. Examination of Weber’s theory bureaucracy, Scott’s thesis on high modernism, Bierschenk’s attempts to place African states in global bureaucratic history. Overarching theme is the place of bureaucratic ambitions and capacities in shaping African trajectories.\n",
      "HIST 370J The Arabic Atlantic. Alan Mikhail, Beshouy Botros. This course begins with advent of colonialism in the Americas in order to rethink the ways in which race and religion comingled in histories of conquest, genocide, and slavery that bridge, but also to sort through the differences between the Atlantic, Caribbean and Mediterranean worlds. The course examines and conceptualizes how the Middle East figured in European imperial projects in the Western Hemisphere. It starts with the Papal sanction of Spanish and Portuguese colonial projects in the Americas as a continuation of their expulsion of the Moors from Iberia and proceeds to examine the histories of enslaved Black Muslims. A visit to the Beinecke Library and the Yale Archives to examine Ezra Stiles’ collection of Hebrew and Arabic texts and the ‘moorish’ identity of the boy he enslaved brings our inquiry closer to home. Additional visits to the archives of American missionary societies active in the Middle East, which are housed at the Yale Divinity School, invites students to examine primary sources linking Yale and New Haven to the Middle East. Our class ends in 1887 with Frederick Douglass’ visit to Egypt and the concurrent histories of officers in the US Confederacy who served in the Egyptian military. By examining how the Middle East came to appear in European imperial projects in the Americas, we can more critically understand how American and European colonizers, missionaries, and travelers came to appear in the Middle East. Topics include toleration and violence, women and gender, settler colonialism, slavery, ecological and climatic changes, and the birth of financial capitalism. The study of the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and the Americas.\n",
      "HIST 380J Revolutionary Mexico. The Mexican revolution erupted as a rebellion to overthrow president Porfirio Diaz after thirty years of oppressive rule, but it soon grew into a fierce conflict between warring factions to define the country's future. For certain revolutionaries, like Emiliano Zapata, this was a battle for the survival of their villages and the recovery of ancestral lands claimed by wealthy elites. For urban liberals, it was a fight to establish a democratic and secular state. Others yet- including industrial laborers, Indigenous leaders, and feminist activists-understood the revolution as a struggle against global capitalism and structures of power, like those of race and gender. As the defining event of modern Mexican history, the revolution casts a long shadow. Engaging in our own process of historical investigation, we ask: How did the revolution transform Mexican society? How do we make sense of the multiplicity of revolutionary experiences? How have Mexicans from across all sectors of society constructed their own historical narratives about the revolution, and what is at stake with their competing interpretations?\n",

      "HIST 391 Pandemics in Africa: From the Spanish Influenza to Covid-19. Jonny Steinberg. The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.\n",
      "HIST 404 What is the University?. Mordechai Levy-Eichel. The University is one of the most influential—and underexamined—kinds of corporations in the modern world. It is responsible both for mass higher education and for elite training. It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective. Topics include: tenure, endowments, the committee system, the growth of degrees, the aims of research, peer-review, the nature of disciplinary divisions, as well as a host of other issues.\n",
      "HIST 407J Textual Technologies in the Early Modern Globe. Devin Fitzgerald. In this methodology seminar, students are invited to explore different aspects of textual technologies to: (1) consider the relationship between textual objects and the societies that produce them; and (2) illustrate how direct engagement with material texts found across many pre-modern and modern societies facilitates a comparative approach to similarities and differences across world regions. Participants deepen and broaden their knowledge while also exploring individual research interests and how they fit within an inclusive vision of global history. By balancing specific knowledge and examples of issues in textual-material history, we endeavor to develop comparative and connected sensitivities that allow for formations of research questions that decenter the hegemonic narratives of the historical discipline.\n",
      "HIST 413 The Historical Documentary. Charles Musser. This course looks at the historical documentary as a method for carrying out historical work in the public humanities. It investigates the evolving discourse sand resonances within such topics as the Vietnam War, the Holocaust and African American history. It is concerned with their relationship of documentary to traditional scholarly written histories as well as the history of the genre and what is often called the \"archival turn.\"\n",
      "HIST 420J Urban Laboratories: Early Modern Citymaking. This interdisciplinary seminar explores the diverse forms of urbanism that emerged in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia before the modern era. Course readings probe the ideas of writers, travellers, politicians, and social reformers on topics including commerce, migration, policing, citizenship, and sexuality. The aspirations and setbacks that emerge from these sources offer a long timescale of evidence of the different ways in which urban societies operated and structured day-to-day life. At the end of term, we look at urban environments of our time. In doing so we articulate comparative perspectives, identifying how today’s cities have mirrored, advanced, and built upon the actions, designs, and errors that early modern cities gave rise to.\n",
      "HIST 435J Colonial Cities: A Global Seminar. Hannah Shepherd. Cities of empire, both imperial capitals and colonial outposts, played crucial roles in the reinforcement of racial hierarchies, the flow of goods, people, and capital, and the representation of imperial power. This course looks at histories of cities around the world in the age of empire, and how they were shaped by these forces. Students gain visual analysis and mapping skills, and learn about the history and theory of imperial, colonial and postcolonial cities, and how they still inform debates over the urban environment today.\n",
      "HIST 459 Climate Change and the Humanities. Katja Lindskog. What can the Humanities tell us about climate change? The Humanities help us to better understand the relationship between everyday individual experience, and our rapidly changing natural world. To that end, students read literary, political, historical, and religious texts to better understand how individuals both depend on, and struggle against, the natural environment in order to survive.\n",

Students make their own maps.\n",
      "HIST 483J Studies in Grand Strategy II. Arne Westad, Jing Tsu, Michael Brenes. The study of grand strategy, of how individuals and groups can accomplish large ends with limited means. During the fall term, students put into action the ideas studied in the spring term by applying concepts of grand strategy to present day issues. Admission is by application only; the cycle for the current year is closed. This course does not fulfill the history seminar requirement, but may count toward geographical distributional credit within the History major for any region studied, upon application to the director of undergraduate studies.\n",

      "HLTH 385 Pandemics in Africa: From the Spanish Influenza to Covid-19. Jonny Steinberg. The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.\n",

Instead of a Renaissance-to-modern survey, we delve deeply into each of the twelve works that form our \"canon,\" chosen both for their extraordinariness and for their capacity to represent different times and places, as well as different media and themes.  We ask what makes these works extraordinary and/or representative, and debate whether or not they properly belong in our \"canon.\" We also address the changing notions of what art is and what functions it fulfills. Each of these twelve works of art are looked at in relation to relevant art objects in Yale’s collections (and in the Metropolitan Museum in New York), as well as corollary works of poetry, literature and film. This is done through readings, seminar discussions, presentations in the galleries, and three research papers. By the end of the semester, each of the students in the class will form their own canon of six to twelve works, and argue for it according to their own values, reasoning and judgment.\n",

      "HSAR 350 Reality and the Realistic. Joanna Fiduccia, Noreen Khawaja. A multidisciplinary exploration of the concept of reality in Euro-American culture. What do we mean when we say something is \"real\" or \"realistic?\" From what is it being differentiated−the imaginary, the surreal, the speculative? Can we approach a meaningful concept of the unreal? This course wagers that representational norms do not simply reflect existing notions of reality; they also shape our idea of reality itself. We study the dynamics of realism and its counterparts across a range of examples from modern art, literature, philosophy, and religion. Readings may include: Aimé Cesaire, Mircea Eliade, Karen Barad, Gustave Flaubert, Sigmund Freud, Renee Gladman, Saidiya Hartman, Arthur Schopenhauer. Our goal is to understand how practices of representation reveal something about our understanding of reality, shedding light on the ways we use this most basic, yet most elusive concept.\n",
      "HSAR 372 Post Black Art and Beyond. Nana Adusei-Poku. In 2001, \"Freestyle\", a survey exhibition curated by Thelma Golden at the Studio Museum in Harlem, introduced a young generation of artists of African descent and the ambitious yet knowingly opaque term post-black to a pre-9-11 pre-Obama world. This seminar utilizes the term post-black as a starting point to investigate the different ways Black Artists identified themselves through the lens of their historical contexts, writings, and politics while engaging with key debates around Black Aesthetics in exhibitions and theory. Consequently, we discuss changes in artistic styles and Black identity discourses from the beginning of the 20th century into the present. Post-black stirred much controversy 22 years ago because it was used by a generation of artists who seemed to distance themselves from previous generations, who utilized the term Black to define their practices as a form of political resistance. However, the claims that the post-black generation made, and the influence of their work is part of an ongoing debate in African Diasporic Art, which has refreshed and posed new questions for art-historical research as well as curation. Topics include Representation, Black Exhibition Histories, Black Aesthetics, Afrotropes, Afro-politanism, Abstraction vs. Figuration, Curation as an Art-Historical tool, The Black Radical Tradition and Racial Uplift, post-race vs. post-black and historical consistencies.\n",
      "HSAR 384 Curating the Pre-Raphaelites. Tim Barringer. The course examines the first British artistic avant-garde, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. It is timed to coincide with a major loan exhibition, The Rossettis, at the Delaware Art Museum and includes a trip to view the exhibition. The purpose of the course is to examine the visual and literary works of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, their associates and followers in the context of the cultural context of Victorian Britain, and to engage with and critique changing curatorial approaches to this work in the museum sector. New literature, published within the last few years, has identified Pre-Raphaelitism as a major avant-garde movement of the mid-nineteenth century, the approach that informed the exhibition Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde at Tate Britain in 2012. New thinking about gender has brought women and queer artists, previously overlooked, to the fore. Having learned how to create catalogue entries, labels, and room texts for a museum display, students produce their own exhibition proposal on an aspect of the Pre-Raphaelites as their final project for the class.\n",
      "HSAR 398 Making Monsters in the Atlantic World. Cecile Fromont, Nathalie Miraval. This seminar introduces students to art historical methodologies through the charged site of the \"monster\" in the Atlantic World. How and why are monsters made? What can visualizations of monsters tell us about how Otherness is constructed, contested, and critiqued? What do monsters tell us about human oppression, agency, and cultural encounters? Analyzing visual and textual primary sources as well as different theoretical approaches, students leave the course with sharper visual analysis skills, a critical awareness of the many-sided discourses on monstrosity, and a deeper understanding of Atlantic history.\n",

      "HSAR 410 Humbugs and Visionaries: American Artists and Writers Before the Civil War. This course examines American literature and visual culture in the years before the Civil War, focusing on the ways that writers and artists not only anticipated but helped construct the modern era. We look in particular at mythmakers, prophets and self-promoters, from poets like Phillis Wheatley and Emily Dickinson, to painters like Thomas Cole and Hudson River School artists, to popular entertainers like P. T. Barnum. Topics include: visuality and the invention of \"whiteness\"; landscape and empire; genre painting and hegemony; race and double-coding; domesticity and sentimentalism.\n",
      "HSAR 418 Seeing, Describing, and Interpreting. Nicola Suthor. Study of select works of art from the period between 1500 and 1800, all on display in the Yale Art Gallery.

      "HSAR 427 Chinese Skin Problems. Quincy Ngan. This seminar uses artwork as a means of understanding the various skin problems faced by contemporary Chinese people. Divided into four modules, this seminar first traces how the \"ideal skin\" as a complex trope of desire, superficiality, and deception has evolved over time through the ghost story, Painted Skin (Huapi), and its countless spin-offs. Second, the course explores how artists have overcome a variety of social distances and barriers through touch; we look at artworks that highlight the healing power and erotic associations of cleansing, massaging, and moisturizing the skin. Third, we explore the relationship between feminism and gender stereotypes through artworks and performances that involve skincare, makeup and plastic surgery. Fourth, the course investigates the dynamics between \"Chineseness,\" colorism, and racial tensions through the artworks produced by Chinese-American and diasporic artists. Each module is comprised of one meeting focusing on theoretical frameworks and two meetings focusing on individual artists and close analysis of artworks. Readings include Cathy Park Hong’s Minor Feelings, Nikki Khanna’s Whiter, and Leta Hong Fincher’s Leftover Women.\n",
      "HSAR 440 Issues in Nineteenth-Century Sculpture. Christina Ferando.

      "HSAR 463 Material Histories of Photography. Jennifer Raab, Paul Messier. While we often see photographs mediated through screens, they are singular objects with specific material histories. Through Yale’s collections, this course explores these histories from the nineteenth century to the present and how they intersect with constructions of class, race, gender, and the non-human world; the ongoing processes of settler-colonialism; and both modern environmental conservation and ecological crisis.\n",
      "HSAR 466 The Technical Examination of Art. Anne Gunnison, Irma Passeri. The primary aim of this course is to develop the skills to closely examine the physical nature of a range of art objects in order to recognize the materials and techniques used at the time of their creation and their layered histories (e.g. use, display, degradation, restoration, and conservation). Understanding techniques and materials can assist in both placing the object in its broader historical context and, in turn, informing that historical context. Students come away from this course with an appreciation for close looking to understand, question, and interpret materials and technique. In seminars taught by conservators from the Art Gallery (YUAG) and other institutions, students examine paintings and objects selected from the Gallery’s collections and made available for examination in the Gallery’s classrooms, learning about artists materials from ancient to modern. Appropriate methods of examination including microscopy, ultraviolet radiation, infrared imaging, x-radiography, and non-destructive methods of analysis are introduced by instructors, as well as scientists from the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (IPCH).\n",
      "HSAR 499 The Senior Essay. Craig Buckley.

It also engages with debates about museums and the ethics of collecting and display. The seminar is structured around selected readings and includes workshops with guest speakers. It also includes an option to conduct in-person research in the Yale University Art Gallery.\n",
      "HSAR 529 Museums and Religion: the Politics of Preservation and Display. Sally Promey. This interdisciplinary seminar focuses on the tangled relations of religion and museums, historically and in the present. What does it mean to \"exhibit religion\" in the institutional context of the museum? What practices of display might one encounter for this subject? What kinds of museums most frequently invite religious display? How is religion suited (or not) for museum exhibition and museum education?\n",
      "HSAR 536 Scale. Joanna Fiduccia. Art history has conventionally maintained a curious \"scale blindness\"—a cultivated insensibility to the influence of scale on the operations of perception and the work of interpretation. We are often similarly blind when it comes to scaling technologies woven into art history’s basic practices, from the slide lecture to the textbook’s reproductions. This course brings the subject into focus by examining theories of scale alongside recent art historical writing. We ask: Is an artwork’s relation to scale different from other objects’? How have technologies of scaling, from photography to GIS mapping, confronted the materiality of artworks? How have theories of scale in other disciplines informed our descriptions of the scale of artworks? And how does the attempt to conduct art history at a \"global scale\" expose the cultural and ideological specificity of scale?\n",
      "HSAR 553 Embodied Artisanal Knowledge. Edward Cooke. The development and transmission of knowledge during the early modern European world has lately been a dynamic subject of scholarly inquiry. Much of this work has focused upon the work of royal academies’ explorations of natural philosophy and the mechanical arts. This seminar seeks to move beyond that narrow geographic focus and descriptive taxonomies to consider embodied artisanal knowledge throughout the world in the period from 1500 to 1800. As Tim Ingold reminds us, embodied knowledge is a skilled, socially generated practice distinct from the innate talents of mechanical execution. It is a cognitive skill that prizes resourcefulness; efficiency of effort; and informed, intensive use of tools. This tacit knowledge, the intellect of the hand, is experienced and felt rather than written about and illustrated. Making things depends upon constant attention to the transmission of ideas from brain to hand and from tool to material, with feedback channeled back through the tool to the body and mind of the maker. This seminar  combines reading, object-driven inquiry, and hands-on exercises to explore the role of materials, techniques, and human agency in the making of objects. Students expand their own approaches to the study of artisans and objects from many periods and places.\n",
      "HSAR 565 The Media of Architecture and the Architecture of Media. Architecture’s capacity to represent a world and to intervene in the world has historically depended on techniques of visualization. This seminar draws on a range of media theoretical approaches to examine the complex and historically layered repertoire of visual techniques within which architecture operates. We approach architecture not as an autonomous entity reproduced by media, but as a cultural practice advanced and debated through media and mediations of various kinds (visual, social, material, and financial). If questions of media have played a key role in architectural theory and history over the past three decades, recent scholarship in the field of media theory has insisted on the architectural, infrastructural, and environmental dimensions of media. The seminar is organized around nine operations whose technical and historical status will be examined through concrete examples. To do so, the seminar presents a range of differing approaches to media and reflects on their implications for architectural and spatial practices today. Key authors include Giuliana Bruno, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Beatriz Colomina, Robin Evans, Friedrich Kittler, Bruno Latour, Reinhold Martin, Shannon Mattern, Marshall McLuhan, Felicity Scott, and Bernhard Siegert, among others.\n",
      "HSAR 584 The Cult of Saints in Early Christianity and the Middle Ages. Felicity Harley, Vasileios Marinis. For all its reputed (and professed) disdain of the corporeal and earthly, Christianity lavished considerable attention and wealth on the material dimension of sainthood and the \"holy\" during its formative periods in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Already in the second century Christian communities accorded special status to a select few \"friends of God,\" primarily martyrs put to death during Roman persecutions. Subsequently the public and private veneration of saints and their earthly remains proliferated, intensified, and became an intrinsic aspect of Christian spirituality and life in both East and West until the Reformation. To do so, it had to gradually develop a theology to accommodate everything from fingers of saints to controversial and miracle-working images. This course investigates the theology, origins, and development of the cult of saints in early Christianity and the Middle Ages with special attention to its material manifestations. The class combines the examination of thematic issues, such as pilgrimage and the use and function of reliquaries (both portable and architectural), with a focus on such specific cases as the evolution of the cult of the Virgin Mary.\n",
      "HSAR 605 Russian Realist Literature and Painting. An interdisciplinary examination of the development of nineteenth-century Russian realism in literature and the visual arts. Topics include the Natural School and the formulation of a realist aesthetic; the artistic strategies and polemics of critical realism; narrative, genre, and the rise of the novel; the Wanderers and the articulation of a Russian school of painting; realism, modernism, and the challenges of periodization. Readings include novels, short stories, and critical works by Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Goncharov, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and others. Painters of focus include Fedotov, Perov, Shishkin, Repin, and Kramskoy. Special attention is given to the particular methodological demands of inter-art analysis.\n",
      "HSAR 646 Readings in Art and Empire. Tim Barringer. This course encourages students to engage with recent thinking on questions of art and empire and to mobilize decolonial methodologies in a research project relating to a specific object in Yale’s collections. The first half of the term is spent discussing key texts, beginning with Ariella Aïsha Azoulay’s Potential History (2019), John Giblin et al \"Dismantling the Master’s House\" (2019), and \"Decolonizing Art and Empire\" by Charlene Villaseñor Black and Tim Barringer (2022). It looks at the possibilities for new studies of art and empire that undermine, rather than replicating imperial structures of power and knowledge. Issues under discussion include slavery and representation, indigeneity and art history, orientalism, theories of hybridity, the colonial uncanny, the representation of landscape and the body in the colony, and science and visual representation. Particular attention is paid to recent work on the British Empire as manifest in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art. The curriculum is shaped to accommodate the research interests of the seminar’s members (to include any and all empires across space and time); in the second half of the term students develop a research paper, generating a methodological approach for the analysis of a single object in Yale’s collections.\n",

      "HSAR 783 Circa 1600. Kishwar Rizvi. This seminar focuses on the art , architecture, and urbanism of early modern empires across West, Central and South Asia, namely, the Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, and Shibanid, and their political and economic ties across the world. The year 1600 is an important temporal hinge, at the height of socio-political migrations and before the realization of full-scale European colonial ambitions. It is also the period of absolutism and millenarian activity, of slavery and the novel, and the institution of new religious and ethnic allegiances. In this manner art and architectural history served at the nexus of commensurability and competition, where artists, merchants, and missionaries crossed geographic and disciplinary borders in order to imagine a new world and their place within it.\n",
      "HSAR 790 African Diasporic Art Historie: Research Seminar on African Di. Nana Adusei-Poku. In this student-driven and self-directed course, we have focused meetings to deepen and discuss questions that are arising from the students' research projects. Depending on the research, we engage with questions of methods, archival findings and their interpretations, historical context, and relevance for the present. Students are supported and guided in queries such as i.e. \"How to narrow down questions and make them productive for an argument?\" or \"Is the analysis of the material sharp enough in order to be convincing?\" This course is foremost an opportunity for graduate students to be able to engage with elements of their research that needs special focus and development.\n",

      "HSHM 413 Infrastructures of Empire: Control and (In)security in the Global South. Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen. This advanced seminar examines the role that infrastructure plays in producing uneven geographies of power historically and in the \"colonial present\" (Gregory 2006). After defining terms and exploring the ways that infrastructure has been conceptualized and studied, we analyze how different types of infrastructure (energy, roads, people, and so on) constitute the material and social world of empire. At the same time, infrastructure is not an uncontested arena: it often serves as a key site of political struggle or even enters the fray as an unruly actor itself, thus conditioning possibilities for anti-imperial and decolonial practice. The geographic focus of this course is the African continent, but we explore comparative cases in other regions of the majority and minority world.\n",
      "HSHM 419 Madness and Decolonization. This seminar traces the history of psychiatry through its encounters and entanglements with colonial and postcolonial power. We begin with a discussion of how psychiatry has been used as an imperial tool of control in the 18th and 19th centuries. We pay particular attention to colonial scientific encounters with Indigenous and enslaved people, and how the psychiatric pathologization of Indigeneity and Blackness informed the construction of settler European whiteness. Then, we move to decolonization in the twentieth century to explore the emergence of international mental health, as former colonies transitioned to independent states. We discuss the attempts of African and Latin American thinkers, such as Frantz Fanon and Ignacio Martín-Baro, to use psychiatry for the liberation of oppressed groups in emerging postcolonial spaces. The seminar finishes with a discussion of the recent emergence of the global mental health movement and calls from former patients, BIPOC and disability activists, and others to \"decolonize mental health\" so that it serves—rather than harms—those traditionally marginalized by Western psychiatry. Throughout the course, students learn to trace the contours of psychiatry and decolonization through a variety of sources, including movies, music, photography, and monographs.\n",
      "HSHM 420 Senior Project Workshop. Megann Licskai. A research workshop for seniors in the HSHM major, intended to move students toward the successful completion of their senior projects and to provide a community for support and for facilitated peer review. Meets periodically throughout the semester for students to discuss stages of the research process, discuss common challenges and practical strategies for addressing them, and to collaboratively support each others' work. The workshop events are structured around the schedule for the fall-to-spring two-term senior project, but students writing one-term projects or spring-to-fall projects also benefit from them, and there will be at least one peer review session to support their key deadlines each semester too.\n",
      "HSHM 422 Cartography, Territory, and Identity. Bill Rankin. Exploration of how maps shape assumptions about territory, land, sovereignty, and identity.

Students make their own maps.\n",
      "HSHM 426 Race and Mental Health in New Haven. Marco Ramos. Recent scholarship in the humanities has critically examined the violence that the mental health care system has inflicted on marginalized communities in the United States. This advanced research seminar explores race, mental health, and harm through the local history of New Haven. We interrogate the past and present of Yale University’s relationship to the surrounding community by unearthing the history of \"community mental health\" at Yale in the 1960s. In particular, the seminar is built around a newly discovered archive in the Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC), an institution that was developed as an urban renewal project that displaced citizens from their homes and jobs in the Hill Neighborhood. The archive details, among other things, the contentious relationship between Yale University and activist community organizations in New Haven during this period, including the Black Panthers and Hill Neighborhood Parents Association. Students develop original research papers based on archival materials. The seminar touches on historical methodology, archiving practices, and how to circulate knowledge about community healing and harm within and beyond the academy. Organizers in New Haven will be invited to reflect on our work at the end of the seminar.\n",
      "HSHM 445 Fetal Histories: Pregnancy, Life, and Personhood in the American Cultural Imagination. Megann Licskai. In our twenty-first-century historical moment, the fetus is a powerful political and cultural symbol. One’s fetal politics likely predicts a lot about how they live their life, vote, worship, and even about how they understand themselves. How, then, has the fetus come to carry the cultural significance that it does? Are there other ways one might think of the fetus? And what is happening in the background when we center the fetus up front? This course examines the many cultural meanings of the fetus in American life: from a clump of cells, to a beloved family member, to political litmus test, and considers the way that these different meanings are connected to questions of human and civil rights, gender relations, bodily autonomy, and political life. We look at the history of our very idea of the fetus and consider how we got here. Each of us may have a different idea of what the fetus is, but every one of those ideas has a particular history. We work to understand those histories, their contexts, and their possible implications for the future of American political life.\n",
      "HSHM 455 Eugenics and its Afterlives. Daniel HoSang. This course examines the influence of Eugenics research, logics, and ideas across nearly every academic discipline in the 20th century, and the particular masks, tropes, and concepts that have been used to occlude attentions to these legacies today. Students make special use of the large collection of archives held within Yale Special Collections of key figures in the American Eugenics Society. Students work collaboratively to identify alternative research practices and approaches deployed in scholarly and creative works that make racial power visible and enable the production of knowledge unburdened by the legacies of Eugenics and racial science.\n",
      "HSHM 458 Scientific Instruments &  the History of Science. Paola Bertucci. What do scientific instruments from the past tell us about science and its history?

      "HSHM 497 Technology in American Medicine from Leeches to Surgical Robots. From leeches to robot-assisted surgery, technology has both driven and served as a marker of change in the history of medicine. Using technology as our primary frame of analysis, this course focuses on developments in modern medicine and healing practices in the United States, from the nineteenth century through the present day. How have technologies, tools, and techniques altered medical practice? Are medical technologies necessarily \"advances?\" How are technologies used to \"medicalize\" certain aspects of the human experience? In this class we focus on this material culture of medicine, particularly emphasizing themes of consumerism, expertise, professional authority, and gender relations.\n",
      "HSHM 498 Collecting Bodies: Historical Approaches to Specimen Collection. Megann Licskai. Why is there a room full of brains in the basement of Yale’s medical school, and why does it welcome hundreds of visitors every year? What compels us about the macabre spectacle of human remains, and what is their place in medical history? What kinds of stories can and should a museum space tell, and what are the multivalent functions of a collection like this in a university setting? Using Yale’s Cushing Center as a center of discussion, this class examines the ethics of collecting and viewing human specimens. The course ties these practices to histories of colonialism, racism, medicine, anthropology, and natural history while considering the cultural specificity of the collectors and the collected. Students analyze the kinds of stories that museum spaces can tell and imagine possibilities for ethical storytelling through both academic analysis and creative engagement. In doing so, we prioritize hands-on historical work while reading theory to address broader ethical and epistemological questions.\n",

      "HSHM 701 Problems in the History of Medicine and Public Health. John Warner. An examination of the variety of approaches to the social and cultural history of medicine and public health. Readings are drawn from recent literature in the field, sampling writings on health care, illness experiences, and medical cultures in Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the United States from antiquity through the twenty-first century. Topics include the role of gender, class, ethnicity, race, religion, and region in the experience of sickness and healing; the intersection of lay and professional understandings of the body; and the role of the marketplace in shaping cultural authority, professional identities, and patient expectations.\n",
      "HSHM 702 Problems in the History of Science. Deborah Coen. Surveys current methodologies through key theoretical and critical works.

      "HSHM 782 Michel Foucault I: The Works, The Interlocutors, The Critics. This graduate-level course presents students with the opportunity to develop a thorough, extensive, and deep (though still not exhaustive!) understanding of the oeuvre of Michel Foucault, and his impact on late-twentieth-century criticism and intellectual history in the United States. Non-francophone and/or U.S. American scholars, as Lynne Huffer has argued, have engaged Foucault’s work unevenly and frequently in a piecemeal way, due to a combination of the overemphasis on The History of Sexuality, Vol 1 (to the exclusion of most of his other major works), and the lack of availability of English translations of most of his writings until the early twenty-first century. This course seeks to correct that trend and to re-introduce Foucault’s works to a generation of graduate students who, on the whole, do not have extensive experience with his oeuvre. In this course, we read almost all of Foucault’s published writings that have been translated into English (which is almost all of them, at this point). We read all of the monographs, and all of the Collège de France lectures, in chronological order. This lightens the reading load; we read a book per week, but the lectures are shorter and generally less dense than the monographs. [The benefit of a single author course is that the more time one spends reading Foucault’s work, the easier reading his work becomes.] We read as many of the essays he published in popular and more widely-circulated media as we can. The goal of the course is to give students both breadth and depth in their understanding of Foucault and his works, and to be able to situate his thinking in relation to the intellectual, social, and political histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Alongside Foucault himself, we read Foucault’s mentors, interlocutors, and inheritors (Heidegger, Marx, Blanchot, Canguilhem, Derrida, Barthes, Althusser, Bersani, Hartman, Angela Davis, etc); his critics (Mbembe, Weheliye, Butler, Said, etc.), and scholarship that situates his thought alongside contemporary social movements, including student, Black liberation, prison abolitionist, and anti-psychiatry movements.\n",

      "HUMS 019 Six Pretty Good Forgeries. Maria del Mar Galindo. What is a forgery? How do we decide what is authentic? In this course, we explore six instances of \"pretty good\" forgeries in global literature: we consider forged objects, forged identities, forged documents, forged power, and forged histories, as well as some good old-fashioned lying. We study poems and other works by forgers, interrogating their features but also celebrating their artistry, and we use the rich collections at Yale’s libraries and museums to come into contact with ways in which forgeries survive and are preserved. Forgery often—though not always!—seeks to deceive, and together we explore the fact that as readers and human beings, we want to believe—but in what? For what reasons? What is the value of the authentic, and what is the value of what we know, or suspect, to be forged?\n",
      "HUMS 020 Six Pretty Good Dogs. Simona Lorenzini. We all have heard the phrase \"Dogs are man’s best friends.\" For thousands and thousands of years there has been an indissoluble friendship between man and dog, an unwritten covenant, a symbiotic relationship that has no equal in the animal world. Why do we consider them our ‘best friends’? And is this always true? If not, why do we sometimes fear dogs? What role have dogs played in our understanding of being human? This course explores images of dogs in 20th-21st Italian literature through six main categories: a man and his dog; dogs and inhumanity; dogs and exile; dogs and children; dogs and folktales; dogs and modern bestiary. We discuss and close read a variety of texts, which are representative of different strategies for reflecting on the self and on the ‘other’ by unpacking the unstable relationship between anthropomorphism, personification, and humanization. Hopefully, these texts impel us to understand how profoundly the animal is involved in the human and the human in the animal. This course is part of the \"Six Pretty Good Ideas\" program.\n",
      "HUMS 021 Six Pretty Good Heroes. Kathryn Slanski. Focusing on the figure of the hero through different eras, cultures, and media, this course provides first-year students with a reading-and writing-intensive introduction to studying the humanities at Yale. The course is anchored around six transcultural models of the hero that similarly transcend boundaries of time and place: the warrior, the sage, the political leader, the proponent of justice, the poet/singer, and the unsung. Our sources range widely across genres, media, periods, and geographies: from the ancient Near Eastern, Epic of Gilgamesh (1500 BCE) to the Southeast Asian Ramayana, to the Icelandic-Ukrainian climate activism film, Woman at War (2018). As part of the Six Pretty Good suite, we explore Yale's special collections and art galleries to broaden our perspectives on hierarchies of value and to sharpen our skills of observation and working with evidence. Six Pretty Good Heroes is a 1.5 credit course, devoting sustained attention students’ academic writing and is an excellent foundation for the next seven semesters at Yale. Required Friday sessions are reserved for writing labs and visits to Yale collections, as well as one-on-one and small-group meetings with the writing instruction staff.\n",
      "HUMS 029 Medicine and the Humanities: Certainty and Unknowing. Matthew Morrison. Sherwin Nuland often referred to medicine as \"the Uncertain Art.\" In this course, we address the role of uncertainty in medicine, and the role that narrative plays in capturing that uncertainty. We focus our efforts on major authors and texts that define the modern medical humanities, with primary readings by Mikhail Bulgakov, Henry Marsh, Atul Gawande, and Lisa Sanders. Other topics include the philosophy of science (with a focus on Karl Popper), rationalism and romanticism (William James), and epistemology and scientism (Wittgenstein).\n",
      "HUMS 033 Six Pretty Good Knights. Alessandro Giammei. What do Batman (the Dark Knight) and Orlando (Charlemagne’s wise paladin) have in common? What is the thread that connects the Jedi knights of Star Wars and those that sat around king Arthur’s round table? How did medieval history and Renaissance poetry inform the expanded universes of superhero movies and fantasy literature, along with the inexhaustible fan-fiction that further extends and queers them? Chivalry, as a code of conduct and a network of symbols, inspired some of the most entertaining stories of the so-called Western canon, blurring the divide between high and popular culture. It offered storytellers (and nerds) of all ages a set of norms to question, bend, and break—especially in terms of gender. It challenged the very format of books, re-defining for good concepts like literary irony, seriality, and inter-mediality. This seminar proposes six pretty good trans-historical archetipes of fictional knights, combining iconic figures such as Marvel’s Iron Man and Italo Calvino’s Agilulfo, Ludovico Ariosto’s Bradamante and Game of Thrones’ Brienne of Tarth, Don Quixote and the Mandalorian. By analyzing together their oaths, weapons, armors, and destinies we aim to develop reading and writing skills to tackle any text, from epic and scholarship to TV-shows and comic-books.\n",
      "HUMS 034 Six Pretty Good Thought Experiments. Jane Mikkelson. Scientists, philosophers, visionaries, and creative writers around the world—in all eras, traditions, and cultures—have often turned to a fascinating form of exploratory inquiry that we today call thought experiments. These short, creative, often wildly outlandish scenarios allow people to ponder some of our most urgent and life-changing questions: How is the universe structured? Are there absolute standards of right conduct? Can we be sure that the world around us is actually real—and does that even matter? This course takes students on an expansive tour of the thought experiment genre, ranging across scientific and philosophical texts, films, and speculative fiction. As we explore what thought experiments are and how they work through contextualized close reading, we also consider broader questions: What does the thought experiment’s form tell us about how we come to know things? Is the thought experiment a clearly defined genre, and does it have a global history? How do thought experiments harness the work of narrative and metaphor, and what interrelations does this reveal between language, imagination, and knowledge? Does science need fiction, and might imagination play a foundational role in the history of ideas and the progress of knowledge?\n",
      "HUMS 037 The Limits of the Human. Steven Shoemaker. As we navigate the demands of the 21st century, an onslaught of new technologies, from artificial intelligence to genetic engineering, has pushed us to question the boundaries between the human and the nonhuman. At the same time, scientific findings about animal, and even plant intelligence, have troubled these boundaries in similar fashion. In this course, we examine works of literature and film that can help us imagine our way into these \"limit cases'' and explore what happens as we approach the limits of our own imaginative and empathetic capacities. We read works of literature by Mary Shelley, Kazuo Ishiguro, Richard Powers, Octavia Butler, Ted Chiang, and Jennifer Egan, and watch the movies Blade Runner, Ex Machina, Arrival, Avatar, and Her.\n",
      "HUMS 040 Bob Dylan as a Way of Life. Benjamin Barasch. An introduction to college-level study of the humanities through intensive exploration of the songs of Bob Dylan. We touch on Dylan’s place in American cultural history but mostly treat him as a great creative artist, tracking him through various guises and disguises across his sixty-year odyssey of self-fashioning, from ‘60s folk revivalist to voice of social protest, abrasive rock ‘n’ roll surrealist to honey-voiced country crooner, loving husband to lovesick drifter, secular Jew to born-again Christian to worldly skeptic, honest outlaw to Nobel Prize-winning chronicler of modern times and philosopher of song. Throughout, we attend to Dylan’s lifelong quest for wisdom and reflect on how it can inspire our own. Topics include: the elusiveness of identity and the need for selfhood; virtue and vice; freedom and servitude; reverence and irreverence; love, desire, and betrayal; faith and unbelief; aging, death, and the possibility of immortality; the authentic and the counterfeit; the nature of beauty and of artistic genius; the meaning of personal integrity in a political world.\n",
      "HUMS 056 Women Who Ruled. Winston Hill. This course examines queens who ruled over hereditary monarchies in their own right. Each week spotlights a different queen or set of related queens. With the use of secondary works and primary sources, students gain some familiarity with the queens themselves, their struggles to use and retain power, and the cultures in which those queens were embedded. Over the duration of the course, students form a basic idea of what queenship has entailed across cultures, while simultaneously discovering how queenship varied in different cultures and material circumstances. The course thereby not only investigates queenship, but also serves as an introduction to the temporal, spatial, and conceptual breadth of world history. And, through watching recent film and television depictions of these queens, students come to grips with the problem of historical memory and the uses (or abuses) to which history can be put.\n",
      "HUMS 060 Novel Novels. Brianne Bilsky. Stream of consciousness. Metafiction. Intertextuality. Typographic experimentation. These are some of the innovative narrative techniques that authors have used to push the boundaries of fiction over time. Why does literary innovation happen? How has the development of fiction been influenced by developments in other fields such as psychology, art, philosophy, or physics? What does it mean to say that a novel is novel? This course addresses such questions by taking an interdisciplinary approach to looking closely at several innovative novels from the early twentieth century to the present. As we move from modernism to postmodernism and on to the present moment, we not only explore the ways that novels may engage creatively with other fields but also how they are in dialogue with literary history itself.\n",
      "HUMS 061 Performing Antiquity. This seminar introduces students to some of the most influential texts of Greco-Roman Antiquity and investigates the meaning of their \"performance\" in different ways: 1) how they were musically and dramatically performed in their original context in Antiquity (what were the rhythms, the harmonies, the dance-steps, the props used, etc.); 2) what the performance meant, in socio-cultural and political terms, for the people involved in performing or watching it, and how performance takes place beyond the stage; 3) how these texts are performed in modern times (what it means for us to translate and stage ancient plays with masks, a chorus, etc.; to reenact some ancient institutions; to reconstruct ancient instruments or compose \"new ancient music\"); 4) in what ways modern poems, plays, songs, ballets constitute forms of interpretation, appropriation, or contestation of ancient texts; 5) in what ways creative and embodied practice can be a form of scholarship. Besides reading ancient Greek and Latin texts in translation, students read and watch performances of modern works of reception: poems, drama, ballet, and instrumental music. A few sessions are devoted to practical activities (reenactment of a symposium, composition of ancient music, etc.).\n",
      "HUMS 065 Education and the Life Worth Living. Matthew Croasmun. Consideration of education and what it has to do with real life—not just any life, but a life worth living. Engagement with three visions of different traditions of imagining the good life and of imagining education: Confucianism, Christianity, and Modernism. Students will be asked to challenge the fundamental question of the good life and to put that question at the heart of their college education.\n",
      "HUMS 073 Classical Storytelling in the Modern World. Brian Price. In his seminal work Poetics, Aristotle first identified the observable patterns and recurring elements that existed in the successful tragedies and epic poems of his time, as he posed the existential query: Why do we tell stories?  And his illuminating analysis and conclusions are still just as meaningful and relevant today in our contemporary dramatic narratives, our movies, plays, and Netflix binges-of-the-week. In this seminar, we examine Aristotle’s observations and conclusions and relate them to the contemporary stories we consume and enjoy today. By doing so, we identify the universal principles that all good stories share, investigate how these principles connect us all despite cultural, ethnic, and geographical differences, learn how to incorporate Aristotle’s precepts into our own creative expression and communications―and most importantly, explore the vital function of storytelling, why we tell them, what makes a good one, and how to best tell one effectively.\n",
      "HUMS 075 Mastering the Art of Watercolor. Adam Van Doren. An introductory course on the art of watercolor as a humanistic discipline within the liberal arts tradition. Readings, discussions, and studio work emphasize critical, creative thinking through a tactile, \"learning by doing\" study of the watercolor medium. Students analyze and imitate the classic techniques of J. M.W. Turner, John Singer Sargent, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Edward Hopper, among others. Studio components include painting en plein air to understand color, form, perspective, composition, and shade and shadow. Basic drawing skills recommended.\n",
      "HUMS 096 Collecting History: \"Treasures\" of Yale. Anna Franz. This course considers the concept of \"treasure\" by visiting nearly all of Yale’s galleries, museums, and library special collections. We explore questions around how these objects and materials were created, how they came to be at Yale, and the considerations and compromises that make up collections of cultural heritage materials. We learn what these objects say about themselves, their creators, their users, and their collectors.\n",
      "HUMS 127 Tragedy in the European Literary Tradition. Timothy Robinson. The genre of tragedy from its origins in ancient Greece and Rome through the European Renaissance to the present day. Themes of justice, religion, free will, family, gender, race, and dramaturgy. Works might include Aristotle's Poetics or Homer's Iliad and plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Seneca, Hrotsvitha, Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Calderon, Racine, Büchner, Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Wedekind, Synge, Lorca, Brecht, Beckett, Soyinka, Tarell Alvin McCraney, and Lynn Nottage.

      "HUMS 139 Western Philosophy in Four Operas 1600-1900. Gary Tomlinson. This course intensively study\\ies four operas central to the western repertory, spanning the years from the early 17th to the late 19th century: Monteverdi's Orfeo, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Wagner's Die Walküre (from The Ring of the Nibelungs), and Verdi's Simon Boccanegra. The course explores the expression in these works of philosophical stances of their times on the human subject and human society, bringing to bear writings contemporary to them as well as from more recent times. Readings include works of Ficino, Descartes, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Douglass, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Adorno. We discover that the expression of changing philosophical stances can be found not only in dramatic themes and the words sung, but in the changing natures of the musical styles deployed.\n",

      "HUMS 177 Tragedy and Politics. Daniel Schillinger. The canonical Greek tragedians—Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides—dramatize fundamental and discomfiting questions that are often sidelined by the philosophical tradition. In this seminar, we read plays about death, war, revenge, madness, impossible choices, calamitous errors, and the destruction of whole peoples. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were also piercing observers of political life. No less than Plato and Aristotle, the Attic tragedians write to elicit reflection on the basic patterns of politics: democracy and tyranny, war and peace, the family and the city, the rule of law and violence. Finally, we also approach Greek tragedy through its reception. Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Nietzsche: all these thinkers responded to tragedy. Texts include Aeschylus, Oresteia; Aristophanes, Frogs and Lysistrata; Euripides, Bacchae, Heracles, and Trojan Women; Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy; Plato, Symposium; and Sophocles, Antigone, Philoctetes, and Oedipus Tyrannus.\n",

      "HUMS 182 The Work of Art in the Age of Revolt. Timothy Kreiner. Modernity inarguably names the growth of markets and civil liberties. Yet every society that took root in the modern period is riddled with ongoing struggles for freedom from the miseries of race, gender, class, and so on. How do we explain that fact? And what part do works of art play in the struggles of the variously dominated and dispossessed today? This course poses those questions by placing major works of literature in conversation with influential works of political theory from the sixteenth through the twenty-first centuries. Along the way we ask also how the work of art came to be seen as part and parcel of workers’ movements alongside struggles for women’s suffrage and the abolition of slavery in the nineteenth century; and why it became crucial, in the eyes of many observers, to the novel liberation movements that circled the globe after 1945. Work by writers and militants such as Thomas Nashe, Martin Luther, Thomas Müntzer, Gerrard Winstanley, Silvia Federici, Frederick Douglass, Toussaint Louverture, Djuna Barnes, Alexandra Kollontai, Marx and Engels, Peter Weiss, V.

      "HUMS 183 Tradition and Modernity: Ethics, Religion, Politics, Law, & Culture. Andrew Forsyth. This seminar is about \"tradition\"—what it is and what it does—and how reflecting on tradition can help us better understand ethics, religion, politics, law, and culture. We ask: for whom and in what ways (if any) are the beliefs and practices transmitted from one generation to another persuasive or even authoritative? And how do appeals to tradition work today? We traverse a series of cases studies in different domains. Looking to ethics, we ask if rational argument means rejecting or inhabiting tradition. Next, we look at religions as traditions and traditions as one source of authority within religions. We consider appeals to tradition in conservative and progressive politics. And how the law uses decisions on past events to guide present actions. Finally, we turn to tradition in civic and popular culture with attention to \"invented traditions,\" the May 2023 British Coronation, and Beyoncé’s 2019 concert film \"Homecoming.\"\n",

      "HUMS 186 War Games. Marijeta Bozovic, Spencer Small. Dismissed, mocked, feared or loved for decades, video games have become a staple of contemporary media, art, and popular culture, studied alongside traditional print media and film. They eclipse the global yearly revenue of both film and music industries combined, leaving their financial significance undeniable. What remains understudied, however, is the political and cultural significance of the medium. War Games is a seminar dedicated to the intersection of video games and political violence (both real and imaginary) in a global and particularly post-Cold War context. Students learn to recognize patterns of ideological communication in video games while developing close reading skills of literature and digital media alike. We combine the study of video games with broader inquires into the media that circulate through the game mediaverse, including literature, social and news media, and film. Playing games and reading books, we pose the following questions: How do players \"perform\" war in games, and how might they resist or subvert expected performances? How indeed are we as readers and players affected by the type of media we consume? What is an adaptation? How do adaptations influence or potentially reshape our relationships with the source material? What themes and ideas are revealed effectively through one medium versus another? Why do certain literary traditions (such as classical Russian literature) provide such fruitful ground for video game adaptation? What are the political implications for the ideologies present in a video game given the globalized position of the medium? Assigned readings include novels, short stories, news media, and internet forums alongside a range of secondary materials, including film and media theory, intellectual and media histories, digital anthropology, reception studies, and interviews.\n",
      "HUMS 191 Dangerous Women: Sirens, Sibyls, Poets and Singers from Sappho through Elena Ferrante. Jane Tylus. Was Sappho a feminist? This course tries to answer that question by analyzing how women’s voices have been appropriated by the literary and cultural canon of the west–and how in turn women writers and readers have reappropriated those voices. Students read a generous amount of literary (and in some cases, musical) works, along with a variety of contemporary theoretical approaches so as to engage in conversation about authorship, classical reception, and materiality. Following an introduction to Greek and Roman texts key for problematic female figures such as sirens and sibyls, we turn to two later historical moments to explore how women artists have both broken out of and used the western canon, redefining genre, content, and style in literary creation writ large. How did Renaissance women such as Laura Cereta, Gaspara Stampa, and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz fashion themselves as authors in light of the classical sources they had at hand? And once we arrive in the 20th and 21st centuries, how do Sibilla Aleramo, Elsa Morante, Anna Maria Ortese, and Elena Ferrante forge a new, feminist writing via classical, queer and/or animal viewpoints?\n",

      "HUMS 275 Literatures of the Plague. Jim Berger. In a new era of pandemic, we have seen how widespread medical crisis has profound effects on individual life and consciousness, and on political and economic institutions and practices. Our material and psychic supply chains grow tenuous. All of life changes even as we try to preserve what we deem most valuable. We must rethink what we consider to be \"essential.\" Yet this is far from being a new condition. Infectious disease has been part of the human social world probably since the beginnings of urban life. The Bible describes plagues sent by God as punishment. The earliest historical depiction was by Thucydides shortly after the plague in Athens in 430 BCE. At each occasion, people have tried to witness and to understand these \"visitations,\" as Daniel Defoe called them. The Plague is always a medical, political, economic and an interpretive crisis. It is also a moral crisis, as people must not only try to understand but also determine how to act. This course studies accounts of pandemics, from Thucydides in Athens up to our ongoing Coronavirus outbreaks. We trace the histories of understanding that accompanied pandemics: religious, scientific, philosophical, ethical, literary. It seems to be the case that these vast, horrifying penetrations of death into the fabric of life have inspired some of our fragile and resilient species’ most strange and profound meditations.\n",

      "HUMS 303 What is the University?. Mordechai Levy-Eichel. The University is one of the most influential—and underexamined—kinds of corporations in the modern world. It is responsible both for mass higher education and for elite training. It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective. Topics include: tenure, endowments, the committee system, the growth of degrees, the aims of research, peer-review, the nature of disciplinary divisions, as well as a host of other issues.\n",
      "HUMS 323 Truth and Sedition. William Klein. The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of \"truth\" change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes implicates modes of knowing? Are there types of truth that any regime would—or should—find dangerous? What are the possible motives and pathways for self-censorship?  We begin with the revolt of the Hebrews against polytheistic Egypt and the Socratic questioning of democracy, and end with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes. We consider these events and texts, and their reverberations and reversals in history, in relation to select analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, Chomsky, Waldron, Zizek, and Xu Zhongrun.\n",

      "HUMS 344 German Film from 1945 to the Present. Fatima Naqvi. Trauma, gender, media, transnationalism, terrorism, migration, precarity, neoliberalism, and environmental ethics are the issues we study in films from the German-speaking world. We begin in the immediate post-war period: How does the Second World War and its aftermath inflect these films? How does gender play an increasingly important role in the fiction films under discussion? What new collective identities do films articulate in the course of the politicized period from the late 1960s into the late 1970s, when home-grown terrorism contests the category of the West German nation? How do the predominant concerns shift with the passage of time and with the changing media formats? What is the role of genre in representing transnational problems like migration after 2000? How do economic issues come to the fore in the precarious economic conditions shown? When does violence seem like an  answer to political, economic, and social pressures and the legacies of colonialism? Particular attention is paid to film aesthetics. Films include those by Julian Radlmaier, Hubert Sauper, Sudabeh Mortezai, Fatih Akin, Wolfgang Staudte, Alexander Kluge, Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Schroeter, Harun Farocki, Michael Haneke, Christian Petzold, Jessica Hausner, Mara Mattuschka, Ulrich Seidl, Nikolaus Geyrhalter, among others. Visiting directors Julian Radlmaier and Hubert Sauper will be integrated into the course.\n",
      "HUMS 347 Land, Liberty, and Slavery from Hobbes to Defoe. Feisal Mohamed. This course considers together several phenomena often considered separately: the conversion of arable land to pasture; the central place of property in seventeenth-century English formulations of political liberty; and the increasing racialization of forced labor in the period. We read seminal works of political theory produced in England’s tumultuous seventeenth century, namely those of Hobbes and Locke. We also explore how transformations of labor and property necessarily exert influence in literature, focusing on Andrew Marvell, Aphra Behn, John Dryden, and Daniel Defoe.\n",
      "HUMS 348 World  War  II:  Homefront  Literature and Film. Katie Trumpener. Taking a pan-European perspective, this course examines quotidian, civilian experiences of war, during a conflict of unusual scope and duration. Considering key works of wartime and postwar fiction and film alongside verbal and visual diaries, memoirs, documentaries, and video testimonies, we will explore the kinds of literary and filmic reflection war occasioned, how civilians experienced the relationship between history and everyday life (both during and after the war), women’s and children's experience of war, and the ways that home front, occupation and Holocaust memories shaped postwar avant-garde aesthetics.\n",
      "HUMS 351 The American Imagination:  From the Puritans to the Civil War. Interdisciplinary examination of the uniqueness of the American experience from the time of the Puritans to the Civil War. Readings draw on major works of political theory, philosophy, and literature.\n",
      "HUMS 366 The World of Victor Hugo's \"Les Misérables\". Maurice Samuels. Considered one of the greatest novels of all time, Victor Hugo's Les Misérables (1862) offers more than a thrilling story, unforgettable characters, and powerful writing. It offers a window into history. Working from a new translation, this seminar studies Hugo's epic masterpiece in all its unabridged glory, but also uses it as a lens to explore the world of nineteenth-century France—including issues such as the criminal justice system, religion, poverty, social welfare, war, prostitution, industrialization, and revolution. Students gain the tools to work both as close readers and as cultural historians in order to illuminate the ways in which Hugo's text intersects with its context. Attention is also paid to famous stage and screen adaptations of the novel: what do they get right and what do they get wrong? Taught in English, no knowledge of French is required.\n",

      "HUMS 387 Introduction to Digital Humanities I: Architectures of Knowledge. Alexander Gil Fuentes. The cultural record of humanity is undergoing a massive and epochal transformation into shared analog and digital realities. While we are vaguely familiar with the history and realities of the analog record—libraries, archives, historical artifacts—the digital cultural record remains largely unexamined and relatively mysterious to humanities scholars. In this course you will be introduced to the broad field of Digital Humanities, theory and practice, through a stepwise exploration of the new architectures and genres of scholarly and humanistic production and reproduction in the 21st century. The course combines a seminar, preceded by a brief lecture, and a digital studio. Every week we will move through our discussions in tandem with hands-on exercises that will serve to illuminate our readings and help you gain a measure of computational proficiency useful in humanities scholarship. You will learn about the basics of plain text, file and operating systems, data structures and internet infrastructure. You will also learn to understand, produce and evaluate a few popular genres of Digital Humanities, including, digital editions of literary or historical texts, collections and exhibits of primary sources and interactive maps. Finally, and perhaps the most important lesson of the semester, you will learn to collaborate with each other on a common research project. No prior experience is required.\n",
      "HUMS 392 Form and Content in Digital and Analog Arts and Sciences. Sayan Bhattacharyya. In this interdisciplinary and multimodal seminar, we look at examples drawn from literature, visual arts, music, film and virtual and augmented reality, focusing on the relationships between form and content in them. We look at the special challenges that digital and computational perspectives present in the context of these relationships, and how humanistic understanding of unifying metaphors drawn from fields such as physics, neuroscience, and AI can help make sense of humans as individuals and as a species with a shared legacy and future. The course consists of discussions of readings in various media of imaginative works of fiction and non-fiction.\n",
      "HUMS 394 Imagining Global Lyric. Ayesha Ramachandran. What is lyric? And what might a multi-dimensional, expansive study of the lyric across cultures, languages, and media look like? This course investigates the possibility of studying lyric poetry in cross-cultural and transmedial ways by combining traditional humanistic approaches with new methods opened by the digital humanities. We begin by examining the lyric poem’s privileged position within a Western literary canon and exploring other conceptions of \"lyric\" in non-Western literary traditions. We then take an anthropological approach and trace the pervasiveness of lyric poetry in the world by focusing on four key questions: (a) what is lyric and how is it related to various literary genres? (b) what is the relationship between lyric and the visual image; (c) can lyric be translated across forms and languages? (d) how does lyric uniquely articulate our relationship to the natural world? Participants engage with primary texts in Yale’s special collections and contribute to a digital project to compile an exhibit of lyric poetry across the world—a project that highlights the importance and challenges of defining just what a lyric poem is. This is a Franke Seminar in the Humanities.\n",
      "HUMS 397 Neighbors and Others. Nancy Levene. This course is an interdisciplinary investigation of concepts and stories of family, community, borders, ethics, love, and antagonism. Otherwise put, it concerns the struggles of life with others – the logic, art, and psychology of those struggles. The starting point is a complex of ideas at the center of religions, which are given to differentiating \"us\" from \"them\" while also identifying values such as the love of the neighbor that are to override all differences. But religion is only one avenue into the motif of the neighbor, a fraught term of both proximity and distance, a contested term and practice trailing in its wake lovers, enemies, kin, gods, and strangers. Who is my neighbor? What is this to ask and what does the question ask of us? Course material includes philosophy, literature, psychology, and film.\n",
      "HUMS 398 Political Theory, The Internet and New Techonologies. Luise Papcke. How do new technologies impact our politics and change our society? How can we assess in which way emerging technologies such as predictive algorithms, automated decision-making, biomedical human enhancements, or workplace automation enhance our freedom, equality, and democracy, or threaten them? This course turns to central ideas in political theory to examine the promises and challenges of these new technologies. Each unit begins with an analysis of core political texts about foundational ideas in liberal democracy. Students study key philosophical debates from the 19th to the 21st century about freedom, equality, and self-rule that have formed Western societies. Next, the course focuses for each theme on a unique emerging technology via magazine articles and news reports. Using concepts from political theory, students analyze how the respective emerging technologies support or challenge our political and social ideas, as well as our current philosophical preconceptions and assumptions.\n",
      "HUMS 403 Interpretations: Simone Weil. Greg Ellermann. Intensive study of the life and work of Simone Weil, one of the twentieth century’s most important thinkers. We read the iconic works that shaped Weil’s posthumous reputation as \"the patron saint of all outsiders,\" including the mystical aphorisms Gravity and Grace and the utopian program for a new Europe The Need for Roots. But we also examine in detail the lesser-known writings Weil published in her lifetime–writings that powerfully intervene in some of the most pressing debates of her day. Reading Weil alongside contemporaries such as Trotsky, Heidegger, Arendt, Levinas, and Césaire, we see how her thought engages key philosophical, ethical, and aesthetic problems of the twentieth century: the relation between dictatorship and democracy; empire and the critique of colonialism; the ethics of attention and affliction; modern science, technology, and the human point of view; the responsibility of the writer in times of war; beauty and the possibility of transcendence; the practice of philosophy as a way of life.\n",
      "HUMS 405 Interpretations Seminar: William Blake. Riley Soles. This course explores the world of William Blake’s poetry, with an emphasis on the longer prophetic poems, in conversation with his artistic output. We locate Blake in his historical moment, responding in his poetry and art to a variety of political, philosophical, and aesthetic movements in England and elsewhere. We also see Blake as part of an evolving literary tradition, paying particular attention to his relationship with his poetic precursor John Milton, and to Romantic contemporaries such as William Wordsworth. Trips to the Beinecke Library and the Yale Center for British Art allow us to see firsthand and to think deeply about the materiality of Blake’s works, as well as the complex relationships in them between text and image. Finally, we consider Blake as a radical religious thinker and innovator by analyzing his poetry’s connections to modes of Biblical vision, prophecy, and apocalypse.\n",
      "HUMS 409 Proust Interpretations: Reading <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>. A close reading (in English) of Marcel Proust’s masterpiece, Remembrance of Things Past, with emphasis upon major themes: time and memory, desire and jealousy, social life and artistic experience, sexual identity and personal authenticity, class and nation. Portions from Swann’s Way, Within a Budding Grove, Cities of the Plain, Time Regained considered from biographical, psychological/psychoanalytic, gender, sociological, historical, and philosophical perspectives.\n",
      "HUMS 410 Modernities: Nineteenth-Century Historical Narratives. Stefanie Markovits, Stuart Semmel. British historical narratives in the nineteenth century, an age often cited as the crucible of modern historical consciousness. How a period of industrialization and democratization grounded itself in imagined pasts—whether recent or distant, domestic or foreign—in both historical novels and works by historians who presented programmatic statements about the nature of historical development.\n",
      "HUMS 416 The Crisis of Liberalism. Bryan Garsten, Ross Douthat, Samuel Moyn. Is there a \"crisis of liberalism\" occurring in the United States and around the world? What is liberalism? If it is in crisis, what are the features of the disorder and what are possible responses? Is it possible to believe in the further progress of liberal societies, or have they fallen into a decadent condition?\n",

      "HUMS 417 Thinking Digitally about the Humanities. Sayan Bhattacharyya. This is an introduction to Digital Humanities, a field of study that has emerged in the past two decades, which consists of humanists and their associates from computational disciplines seeking to apply digital methods, broadly understood, to the kinds of questions that tend to be of interest in the humanities. We look at how methods drawn from information science, such as data analytics and artifical intelligence, are being applied to humanistic disciplines, especially textual understanding and analysis.\n",
      "HUMS 418 \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy:\" Paranoia and Conspiracy Theories in 20th and 21st C. America. In this course we examine the development and growth of conspiracy theories in American politics and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We look at texts from a variety of different analytical and political traditions to develop an understanding of how and why conspiracy theories develop, their structural dynamics, and how they function as a narrative. We examine a variety of different conspiracy theories and conspiratorial groups from across the political spectrum, but we pay particular attention to anti-Semitism as a foundational form of conspiracy theorizing, as well as the particular role of conspiracy theories in far-right politics, ranging from the John Birch Society in the 1960s to the Tea Party, QAnon, and beyond in the 21st century. We also look at how real conspiracies shape and reinforce conspiracy theorizing as a mode of thought, and formulate ethical answers on how to address conspiracy as a mode of politics.\n",
      "HUMS 419 The Short Spring of German Theory. Kirk Wetters. Reconsideration of the intellectual microclimate of German academia 1945-1968. A German prelude to the internationalization effected by French theory, often in dialogue with German sources. Following Philipp Felsch's The Summer of Theory (English 2022): Theory as hybrid and successor to philosophy and sociology. Theory as the genre of the philosophy of history and grand narratives (e.g. \"secularization\"). Theory as the basis of academic interdisciplinarity and cultural-political practice. The canonization and aging of theoretical classics. Critical reflection on academia now and then. Legacies of the inter-War period and the Nazi past: M. Weber, Heidegger, Husserl, Benjamin, Kracauer, Adorno, Jaspers. New voices of the 1950s and 1960s: Arendt, Blumenberg, Gadamer, Habermas, Jauss, Koselleck, Szondi, Taubes.\n",
      "HUMS 421 The End of the World. A philosophical investigation of present-day apocalyptic fears, utopian dreams, and possible ways that the world (as we know it) might end. Topics to be examined include the potential implications of artificial superintelligence, the assumptions dividing climate alarmists and their critics, the promises and perils of life in virtual worlds, competing views on whether we should seek to avert humanity’s extinction or welcome it, and contrasts between secular and religious ways of relating to the end. Engagement with these topics provides the occasion to engage with questions of enduring philosophical and existential importance: what is most valuable, how should we live, and for what should we hope?\n",
      "HUMS 425 Reality and the Realistic. Joanna Fiduccia, Noreen Khawaja. A multidisciplinary exploration of the concept of reality in Euro-American culture. What do we mean when we say something is \"real\" or \"realistic?\" From what is it being differentiated−the imaginary, the surreal, the speculative? Can we approach a meaningful concept of the unreal? This course wagers that representational norms do not simply reflect existing notions of reality; they also shape our idea of reality itself. We study the dynamics of realism and its counterparts across a range of examples from modern art, literature, philosophy, and religion. Readings may include: Aimé Cesaire, Mircea Eliade, Karen Barad, Gustave Flaubert, Sigmund Freud, Renee Gladman, Saidiya Hartman, Arthur Schopenhauer. Our goal is to understand how practices of representation reveal something about our understanding of reality, shedding light on the ways we use this most basic, yet most elusive concept.\n",
      "HUMS 429 Paul Celan. Thomas Connolly. An undergraduate seminar in English exploring the life and work of Paul Celan (1920-1970), survivor of the Shoah, and one of the foremost European poets of the second half of the twentieth century. We will read from his early poems in both Romanian and German, and his published collections including Der Sand aus den Urnen, Mohn und Gedächtnis, Von Schelle zu Schelle, Sprachgitter, Die Niemandsrose, Atemwende, Fadensonnen, Lichtzwang, and Schneepart. We will also read from his rare pieces in prose and his correspondence with family, friends, and other intellectuals and poets including Bachmann, Sachs, Heidegger, Char, du Bouchet, Michaux, Ungaretti. A special focus on his poetic translations from French, but also Russian, English, American, Italian, Romanian, Portuguese, and Hebrew. Critical readings draw from Szondi, Adorno, Derrida, Agamben, and others. Readings in English translation or in the original languages, as the student desires. Discussions in English.\n",
      "HUMS 432 Rousseau's Emile. Bryan Garsten. A close reading of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s masterpiece, Emile. Though the book poses as a guide to education, it has much grander aspirations; it offers a whole vision of the human condition. Rousseau called it his \"best and worthiest work\" and said he believed it would spark a revolution in the way that human beings understand themselves. Many historians of thought believe that the book has done just that, and that we live in the world it helped to create – a claim we consider and evaluate. Presented as a private tutor’s account of how he would arrange the education of a boy named Emile from infancy through young adulthood, the book raises fundamental questions about human nature and malleability, how we learn to be free, whether we can view ourselves scientifically and still maintain a belief in free will, whether we are need of some sort of religious faith to act morally, how adults and children, and men and women, ought to relate to one another, how the demands of social life and citizenship affect our happiness – and more. Ultimately the question at issue is whether human beings can find a way to live happily and flourish in modern societies.\n",
      "HUMS 435 Radical Cinemas in the Global Sixties. Lorenz Hegel, Moira Fradinger. \"1968\" has become a cipher for a moment of global turmoil, social transformation and cultural revolution. This class explores the \"long global sixties\" through cinema produced across continents. At the height of the Cold War between two blocks in the \"East\" and the \"West,\" the \"Third World\" emerged as a radical political project alternative to a world order shaped by centuries of colonialism, imperialism, slavery, and capitalist exploitation. Liberation, emancipation, independence, anticolonialism, decolonization, and revolution became key words in the global political discourse. Leaders from Africa, Asia, and Latin America created a new international platform, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) that challenged the Cold War bi-polarity. Radical filmmakers who belong in this period experimented with strategies of storytelling and of capturing reality, calling into question rigid distinctions between \"documentary\" and \"fiction\" and \"art and politics.\" The goal was not to \"show\" reality, but to change it. We study a world-wide range of examples that involve filmmakers’ collaborations across The Americas, Western Europe, North Africa, South and South-East Asia. Taught in English; films aresubtitled but knowledge of other languages may be useful.\n",
      "HUMS 437 Troubling Transparency. Emmanuel Alloa. Transparency is the metaphor of our time. Whether in government or corporate governance, finance, technology, health, or the media–it is ubiquitous today, and there is hardly a current debate that does not call for more transparency. But what does this word actually stand for and what are the consequences for the life of individuals? \"Know thyself\" were the words inscribed above the entrance to the temple of Apollo at Delphi. In the modern age, however, the demand for self-transparency has been given a completely new foundation, since it is no longer regarded merely as a moral duty of the individual toward himself, but as a normative prerequisite of democratic societies. The seminar reconstructs the success of this category on the basis of relevant classical texts, in both epistemological-individual and social-theoretical-social perspectives (important authors are Augustine, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, Georg Simmel, Jean-Paul Sartre, Michel Foucault). The aim is to critically question this consensus value of modernity, and to inquire into its internal dialectic. With a view to contested phenomena of the present (social networks, surveillance society, post-democracy), we examine under which conditions transparency enables emancipatory effects and where, on the other hand, it generates conformism and threatens a pluralist society. As an attempt to map an alternative genealogy of modernity, the seminar provides some overview of a range of canonical modernist theorists and reads them in a new light.\n",
      "HUMS 443 Medieval Jews, Christians, and Muslims In Conversation. Ivan Marcus. How members of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities thought of and interacted with members of the other two cultures during the Middle Ages. Cultural grids and expectations each imposed on the other; the rhetoric of otherness—humans or devils, purity or impurity, and animal imagery; and models of religious community and power in dealing with the other when confronted with cultural differences. Counts toward either European or Middle Eastern distributional credit within the History major, upon application to the director of undergraduate studies.\n",

      "HUMS 480 The Mortality of the Soul: From Aristotle to Heidegger. Martin Hagglund. This course explores fundamental philosophical questions of the relation between matter and form, life and spirit, necessity and freedom, by proceeding from Aristotle's analysis of the soul in De Anima and his notion of practical agency in the Nicomachean Ethics. We study Aristotle in conjunction with seminal works by contemporary neo-Aristotelian philosophers (Korsgaard, Nussbaum, Brague, and McDowell). We in turn pursue the implications of Aristotle's notion of life by engaging with contemporary philosophical discussions of death that take their point of departure in Epicurus (Nagel, Williams, Scheffler). We conclude by analyzing Heidegger's notion of constitutive mortality, in order to make explicit what is implicit in the form of the soul in Aristotle.\n",

      "HUMS 500 Seminar in Digital and Computational Methods in the Humanities. This seminar is an introduction to the principles and methods of digital humanities, an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to apply digital, especially computational, methods to the humanities. In the seminar, we discuss the capabilities as well as limitations of computational tools for interpretation in the humanities. The seminar focuses on how computational methods and tools can contribute to the interpretive activities that typically constitute humanistic inquiry, especially to the reading of textual matter as literature. The seminar acquaints participants with methodological and epistemological issues and case studies in the digital humanities. The seminar is structured around the following premise: As technology increasingly permeates every corner of human activity, we are called upon to address complex problems in more unstructured contexts and situations than ever before. The humanities are a useful arena to understand such complexity by making use of computation to complement (not replace) traditional humanistic modes of inquiry, and also to explore how approaches that work well for well‐structured problems reach their limits of applicability. Digital humanities act as a bridge between the humanities and quantitative disciplines. This bridge can be traversed in either direction. So, this seminar welcomes participants from both humanities backgrounds and interests as well as from non-humanities disciplines and interests. This is an interdisciplinary seminar, and so prior interest in computation, while certainly helpful, is not necessary.\n",

An integrative overview of the structure and function of the human brain as it pertains to major neurological and psychiatric disorders. Neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and clinical correlations are interrelated to provide essential background in the neurosciences. Lectures in neurocytology and neuroanatomy survey neuronal organization in the human brain, with emphasis on long fiber tracts related to clinical neurology. Lectures in neurophysiology cover various aspects of neural function at the cellular and systems levels, with a strong emphasis on the mammalian nervous system. Clinical correlations consist of sessions applying basic science principles to understanding pathophysiology in the context of patients. Seven three-hour laboratory sessions are coordinated with lectures throughout the course to provide an understanding of the structural basis of function and disease. Case-based conference sections provide an opportunity to integrate and apply the information learned about the structure and function of the nervous system in the rest of the course to solving a focused clinical problem in a journal club format.

      "ITAL 020 Six Pretty Good Dogs. Simona Lorenzini. We all have heard the phrase \"Dogs are man’s best friends.\" For thousands and thousands of years there has been an indissoluble friendship between man and dog, an unwritten covenant, a symbiotic relationship that has no equal in the animal world. Why do we consider them our ‘best friends’? And is this always true? If not, why do we sometimes fear dogs? What role have dogs played in our understanding of being human? This course explores images of dogs in 20th-21st Italian literature through six main categories: a man and his dog; dogs and inhumanity; dogs and exile; dogs and children; dogs and folktales; dogs and modern bestiary. We discuss and close read a variety of texts, which are representative of different strategies for reflecting on the self and on the ‘other’ by unpacking the unstable relationship between anthropomorphism, personification, and humanization. Hopefully, these texts impel us to understand how profoundly the animal is involved in the human and the human in the animal. This course is part of the \"Six Pretty Good Ideas\" program.\n",
      "ITAL 030 Six Pretty Good Knights. Alessandro Giammei. What do Batman (the Dark Knight) and Orlando (Charlemagne’s wise paladin) have in common? What is the thread that connects the Jedi knights of Star Wars and those that sat around king Arthur’s round table? How did medieval history and Renaissance poetry inform the expanded universes of superhero movies and fantasy literature, along with the inexhaustible fan-fiction that further extends and queers them? Chivalry, as a code of conduct and a network of symbols, inspired some of the most entertaining stories of the so-called Western canon, blurring the divide between high and popular culture. It offered storytellers (and nerds) of all ages a set of norms to question, bend, and break—especially in terms of gender. It challenged the very format of books, re-defining for good concepts like literary irony, seriality, and inter-mediality. This seminar proposes six pretty good trans-historical archetipes of fictional knights, combining iconic figures such as Marvel’s Iron Man and Italo Calvino’s Agilulfo, Ludovico Ariosto’s Bradamante and Game of Thrones’ Brienne of Tarth, Don Quixote and the Mandalorian. By analyzing together their oaths, weapons, armors, and destinies we aim to develop reading and writing skills to tackle any text, from epic and scholarship to TV-shows and comic-books.\n",

      "ITAL 340 Dangerous Women: Sirens, Sibyls, Poets and Singers from Sappho through Elena Ferrante. Jane Tylus. Was Sappho a feminist? This course tries to answer that question by analyzing how women’s voices have been appropriated by the literary and cultural canon of the west–and how in turn women writers and readers have reappropriated those voices. Students read a generous amount of literary (and in some cases, musical) works, along with a variety of contemporary theoretical approaches so as to engage in conversation about authorship, classical reception, and materiality. Following an introduction to Greek and Roman texts key for problematic female figures such as sirens and sibyls, we turn to two later historical moments to explore how women artists have both broken out of and used the western canon, redefining genre, content, and style in literary creation writ large. How did Renaissance women such as Laura Cereta, Gaspara Stampa, and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz fashion themselves as authors in light of the classical sources they had at hand? And once we arrive in the 20th and 21st centuries, how do Sibilla Aleramo, Elsa Morante, Anna Maria Ortese, and Elena Ferrante forge a new, feminist writing via classical, queer and/or animal viewpoints?\n",

This class introduces graduate students in the Humanities and the Social Sciences to Italian critical theory from the 15th century to the present by focusing on different ways of thinking about the emergence of the modern subject, subjectivity and subjection. We read political thinkers and cultural critics like Machiavelli, Vico, Leopardi, Gramsci, Negri, Federici, Lazzarato, Agamben, Braidotti, and Eco. The theorists we read ask us to think about the multiple ways in which one becomes a modern subject by being hailed by particular ideas of what it means to be human, as well as by the State and by capitalism. Our journey into Italian thought is structured through four units: 1) Beyond the Modern Subject: Theorizing the Post-Human; 2) Subjectivity: Theorizing the Modern State; 3) Subjection: Theorizing Modern Economies; 4) The Modern Subject Before Modernity: Italian Renaissance Thought and the Human.

How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies.

      "JDST 808 The Cairo Genizot and their Literatures. Miriam Goldstein. Ancient and medieval Jews did not throw away Hebrew texts they considered sacred, but rather, they deposited and/or buried them in dedicated rooms known as Genizot. The most famous of these depositories was in the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Old Cairo, which contained perhaps the single most important trove ever discovered of Jewish literary and documentary sources from around the Mediterranean basin, sources dating as early as the ninth century and extending into the early modern period. This course introduces students to the Jewish manuscript remains of the medieval Cairo Genizah as well as other important Cairo manuscript caches. Students study the wide variety of types of literary and documentary genres in these collections and gain familiarity with the history of the Genizah’s discovery in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as well as the acquisition of these manuscripts by institutions outside the Middle East (including Harvard). Readings, including primary Genizah sources, are in English translation, but students with knowledge of Arabic are offered an additional weekly session providing instruction in reading Judeo-Arabic and centered on readings of sources in the Judeo-Arabic original.\n",
      "JDST 862 The Betrayal of the Intellectuals. Hannan Hever. The target of the seminar is to clarify the concept of the intellectual and its political and literary uses during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The point of departure is Julien Benda’s influential book, The Betrayal of the Intellectuals (1927). Benda defines two kinds of intellectuals: the particularists, who are specifically committed to country, party, and economic issues—later thought of as the arena of \"identity politics\"—and the universalists, committed to more general humanist values. What makes one an intellectual? Does becoming an intellectual depend on specific historical, social, cultural, literary, and political conditions? Is being an intellectual a matter of \"talking truth to power\" in accordance with universalist values? The course looks at a variety of definitions of what constitutes an intellectual, based on approaches such as Benda’s notion of the betrayal of the particularist intellectual, or postcolonial intellectualism. The course then looks at the specificity of intellectualism as it appears in certain contexts through readings from Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Joshua Heschel, Jean-Paul Sartre, George Orwell, Naguib Mahfouz, Frantz Fanon, Eleanor Roosevelt, James Baldwin, Angela Davis, Martin Buber, Edward Said, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, and Toni Morrison.\n",

      "LAST 100 Introduction to Latin American Studies: History, Culture and Society. Maria Aguilar Velasquez. What is Latin America? The large area we refer to as Latin America is not unified by a single language, history, religion, or type of government. Nor is it unified by a shared geography or by the prevalence of a common language or ethnic group. Yet Latin America does, obviously, exist. It is a region forged from the merging of diverse cultures, historical experiences, and processes of resistance. This course provides an overview of Latin America and the Caribbean from the 16th century up to the present. While the class aims to provide students with an understanding of the region, due to time constraints, it focuses primarily on the experiences and histories of selected countries. The course introduces students to some of the most important debates about the region’s history, politics, society, and culture. The course follows a chronological structure while also highlighting thematic questions. Drawing on academic readings, films, music, art, literature, testimony, oral histories, and writings from local voices the class explores the political transformation of the region, as well as topics related to ethnic and racial identity, revolution, social movements, religion, violence, military rule, democracy, transition to democracy, and migration.\n",

Extreme weather, proliferation of species extinctions, climate migration, and the outbreak of pandemics can all be understood as instances of koyaanisqatsi, the Hopi word for life out of balance. They may also be viewed as indications that we are living in the age of the Anthropocene, a term in the natural and social sciences that acknowledges that human activities have had a radical geological impact on the planet since the onset of the Industrial revolution. In this course we study relations between humans and other-than-humans to understand how we arrived at a life out of balance. We inquire into how binary distinctions between nature and culture are made, sustained, or questioned through a diversity of meaning-making practices in Spanish, Latin American, and indigenous literature, visual culture, and material culture. The indigenous artifacts studied include Popol Vuh, poetry, petroglyphs, and documentaries by indigenous people of the Amazon, which provide opportunities for asking pressing questions: To what extent does the nature and culture binary foreclose alternative possibilities for imagining ourselves and our relation to the world? Are there ways of perceiving our world and ourselves that bypass such binaries and if so, what are they? In the final weeks of the course, we draw from our insights to investigate where the nature/culture binary figures in present discussions of environmental catastrophes and rights of nature movements in Latin America.

      "LAST 228 Borders & Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures. Luna Najera. The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization? \n",

      "LAST 359 Radical Cinemas in the Global Sixties. Lorenz Hegel, Moira Fradinger. \"1968\" has become a cipher for a moment of global turmoil, social transformation and cultural revolution. This class explores the \"long global sixties\" through cinema produced across continents. At the height of the Cold War between two blocks in the \"East\" and the \"West,\" the \"Third World\" emerged as a radical political project alternative to a world order shaped by centuries of colonialism, imperialism, slavery, and capitalist exploitation. Liberation, emancipation, independence, anticolonialism, decolonization, and revolution became key words in the global political discourse. Leaders from Africa, Asia, and Latin America created a new international platform, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) that challenged the Cold War bi-polarity. Radical filmmakers who belong in this period experimented with strategies of storytelling and of capturing reality, calling into question rigid distinctions between \"documentary\" and \"fiction\" and \"art and politics.\" The goal was not to \"show\" reality, but to change it. We study a world-wide range of examples that involve filmmakers’ collaborations across The Americas, Western Europe, North Africa, South and South-East Asia.

      "LATN 444 Roman Consolation Literature: Seneca and Boethius. Rosalie Stoner. In a Greco-Roman context, consolation literature is a genre of writing that attempts to comfort someone for a loss. By drawing on commonplace philosophical arguments and rhetorical exhortations, consolations offer a kind of therapy for those affected by the death or exile of a loved one, or by one’s own loss of status. This advanced Latin course introduces students to two important prose texts from the Roman tradition of consolation literature: Seneca the Younger’s Ad Helviam (first century CE) and Boethius’ De Consolatione Philosophiae (sixth century CE).  Seneca’s consolation, addressed to his mother, attempts to comfort her for his own exile, while Boethius’ consolation represents a dialogue between the author and the quasi-divine figure of Philosophia, who rebukes Boethius for mourning his loss of fortune and leads him to embrace a cosmic perspective on his suffering. While continuing to build fluency in reading Latin prose at the advanced level, we explore relevant secondary scholarship on these texts and familiarize ourselves with an oft-neglected genre that opens up broader questions about the roles that literature and philosophy can play in addressing emotional and psychological challenges.\n",

      "LING 033 Words, Words, Words: The Structure and History of English Words. Peter Grund. Meggings. Perpendicular. Up. Ain’t. Eerily. Bae. The. These are all words in the English language, but, like all words, they have different meanings, functions, and social purposes; indeed, the meaning and function may be different for the same word depending on the context in which we use it (whether spoken or written). In this course, we explore the wonderful world of words. We look at how we create new words (and why), how we change the meaning of words, and how words have been lost (and revived) over time. As we do so, we look at debates over words and their meanings now (such as the feeling by some that ain’t is not a word at all) and historically (such as the distaste for subpeditals for ‘shoes’ in the sixteenth century), and how words can be manipulated to insult, hurt, and discriminate against others. We look at a wide range of texts by well-known authors (such as Shakespeare) as well as anonymous online bloggers, and we make use of online tools like the Google Ngram viewer and the Corpus of Historical American English to see how words change over time. At the end of the course, I hope you see how we make sophisticated use of words and how studying them opens up new ways for you to understand why other people use words the way they do and how you can use words for various purposes in your own speech and writing.\n",
      "LING 107 Linguistic Diversity & Endangerment. Edwin Ko. \"How many languages are there in the world?\"—what does this question even mean? What would a satisfying answer look like? This class comprises a geographical and historical survey of the world’s languages and attends to how languages can differ from one another. According to UNESCO, more than half of world languages (virtually all of which are spoken by indigenous communities) will have gone extinct by the end of the century. We interrogate notions like language endangerment, shift and death, and we consider the threats that these pose to global linguistic diversity. There is a striking correlation between the geographic distribution of linguistic and biological diversity, although proportionally, far more languages are endangered than biological species; the question of how (and why? and whether?) to respond to that situation is a matter of serious import for the 21st Century. This course surveys the various ways in which the world’s linguistic diversity and language ecologies can be assessed—and discusses the serious threats to that diversity, why this might be a matter of concern, and the principle of linguistic human rights. Students have the opportunity to investigate a minority language in some depth and report on its status with respect to the range of issues discussed in class.\n",
      "LING 110 Language: Introduction to Linguistics. Jim Wood. This is a course about language as a window into the human mind and language as glue in human society. Nature, nurture, or both? Linguistics is a science that addresses this puzzle for human language. Language is one of the most complex of human behaviors, but it comes to us without effort. Language is common to all societies and is typically acquired without explicit instruction. Human languages vary within highly specific parameters. The conventions of speech communities exhibit variation and change over time within the confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. The properties of universal grammar are discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages and comparison across languages. This course introduces analytical methods that are used to understand this fundamental aspect of human knowledge. In this introductory course students learn about the principles that underly all human languages, and what makes language special. We study language sounds, how words are formed, how humans compute meaning, as well as language in society, language change, and linguistic diversity.\n",

      "LING 191 “Sprachkrise”—Philosophies & Language Crises. Sophie Schweiger. The crisis of language predates the invention of ChatGPT (who may or may not have helped write this syllabus). This course delves into the concept of language crises and its long history from a philosophical and literary perspective, examining how crises of language are represented in literature and how they reflect broader philosophical questions about language, identity, and power. We explore different philosophical approaches to language, such as the history of language and philology (Herder, Humboldt, Nietzsche), structuralism and post-structuralism (Saussure), analytical and pragmatic philosophies (Wittgenstein), phenomenology and deconstruction (Heidegger), and analyze how these theories shape our understanding of language while simultaneously evoking its crisis. The course also examines how such language crises are represented and produced in literature and the arts; how authors and artists approach the complexities of language loss, and how crises help birth alternative systems of signification. Through close readings of literary texts by Hofmannsthal, Musil, Bachmann, et. al., we analyze the symbolic and metaphorical significance of language crises, as well as the ethical and political implications of language loss for (cultural) identity. Experimental use of language such as DaDa artwork, performance cultures, and \"Sprachspiel\" poetry by the \"Wiener Gruppe,\" as well as contemporary KI/AI literature, further complement the theoretical readings. By exploring language crises through the lens of philosophy and literature, we gain a deeper understanding of the role of language—and its many crises—in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our communities.\n",

      "LING 253 Syntax I. Raffaella Zanuttini. If you knew all the words of a language, would you be able to speak that language? No, because you’d still need to know how to put the words together to form all and only the grammatical sentences of that language. This course focuses on the principles of our mental grammar that determine how words are put together to form sentences. Some of these principles are shared by all languages, some differ from language to language. The interplay of the principles that are shared and those that are distinct allows us to understand how languages can be very similar and yet also very different at the same time. This course is mainly an introduction to syntactic theory: it introduces the questions that the field asks, the methodology it employs, some of the main generalizations that have been drawn and results that have been achieved. Secondarily, this course is also an introduction to scientific theorizing: what it means to construct a scientific theory, how to test it, and how to choose among competing theories.\n",

      "LING 398 Plurality, Optional Plurality, Pluractionality. Veneeta Dayal. The concept of singularity vs. plurality is arguably universal, yet its morpho-syntactic expression is subject to a great deal of cross-linguistic variation. Many languages have one form for singular reference and another for plural. English, for example, canonically uses the unmarked form of a noun for singular reference and a plural marked form for plural reference, at least with count nouns: dog vs. dog+s. In many languages, the base form itself can be used to refer to a plurality but there is nevertheless a form that can be added to ensure plurality. Mandarin, for example, uses the base form itself to refer to singularities as well as pluralities but the addition of the plural marker rules out the possibility of singular reference: gou \"the dog/the dogs\" vs. gou-men \"the dogs\". Finally, there are languages, such as Cuzco Quechua, in which the verb has a singular and a plural form, such that the singular form refers to a single event while the plural form refers to a plurality of events. In this course we discuss the semantic underpinnings of these three types of plural morphology, plural marking as in English -s, optional plurality as in Mandarin -men, and pluractionality as in Quechua plural marked verbs.\n",

This course investigates the possibility of studying lyric poetry in cross-cultural and transmedial ways by combining traditional humanistic approaches with new methods opened by the digital humanities. We begin by examining the lyric poem’s privileged position within a Western literary canon and exploring other conceptions of \"lyric\" in non-Western literary traditions. We then take an anthropological approach and trace the pervasiveness of lyric poetry in the world by focusing on four key questions: (a) what is lyric and how is it related to various literary genres? (b) what is the relationship between lyric and the visual image; (c) can lyric be translated across forms and languages? (d) how does lyric uniquely articulate our relationship to the natural world? Participants engage with primary texts in Yale’s special collections and contribute to a digital project to compile an exhibit of lyric poetry across the world—a project that highlights the importance and challenges of defining just what a lyric poem is.

What can they tell us about the past? How do we analyze the roles of the narrator, the author, and the protagonist? How should we understand the ideological tensions between official histography and personal reminiscences, especially in 20th-century Russia? This course aims to answer these questions through close readings of a few cultural celebrities’ memoirs and autobiographical writings that are also widely acknowledged as the best representatives of 20th-century Russian prose. Along the way, we read literary texts in dialogue with theories of memory, historiography, and narratology.

Students with knowledge of Russian are encouraged to read in the original language. All readings are available in English.\n",
      "LITR 210 Art and Resistance in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Andrei Kureichyk. This interdisciplinary seminar is devoted to the study of protest art as part of the struggle of society against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It focuses on the example of the Soviet and post-Soviet transformation of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course begins by looking at the influence of the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: \"nonconformism,\" \"dissidence,\" \"mimicry,\" \"rebellion.\" The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism. These themes are explored at different levels through specific examples from the works and biographies of artists. Students immerse themselves in works of different genres: films, songs, performances, plays and literary works.\n",

      "LITR 257 Poetics of the Short Form. Austen Hinkley. This seminar investigates the rich German tradition of literary short forms, such as the aphorism, the fairy tale, and the joke. Our readings cover small works by major authors from the 18th through the early 20th century, including novellas by Goethe, Kleist, and Droste-Hülshoff, fantastic tales by the Brothers Grimm and Kafka, and short philosophical texts by Lichtenberg, Nietzsche, and Benjamin. We focus on the ways in which short forms not only challenge our understanding of literature and philosophy, but also interact with a wide range of other fields of knowledge like medicine, natural science, law, and history. By considering the possibilities of these mobile and dynamic texts, we explore their power to change how we think about and act in the world. What can be said in an anecdote, a case study, or a novella that could not be said otherwise? How can short forms illuminate the relationship between the literary and the everyday? How might these texts transform our relationship to the short forms that we interact with in our own lives?\n",

      "LITR 303 Socialist '80s: Aesthetics of Reform in China and the Soviet Union. Jinyi Chu. This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of the complex cultural and political paradigms of late socialism from a transnational perspective by focusing on the literature, cinema, and popular culture of the Soviet Union and China in 1980s. How were intellectual and everyday life in the Soviet Union and China distinct from and similar to that of the West of the same era? How do we parse \"the cultural logic of late socialism?\" What can today’s America learn from it? Examining two major socialist cultures together in a global context, this course queries the ethnographic, ideological, and socio-economic constituents of late socialism. Students analyze cultural materials in the context of Soviet and Chinese history. Along the way, we explore themes of identity, nationalism, globalization, capitalism, and the Cold War. Students with knowledge of Russian and Chinese are encouraged to read in original languages. All readings are available in English.\n",

      "LITR 347 Dangerous Women: Sirens, Sibyls, Poets and Singers from Sappho through Elena Ferrante. Jane Tylus. Was Sappho a feminist? This course tries to answer that question by analyzing how women’s voices have been appropriated by the literary and cultural canon of the west–and how in turn women writers and readers have reappropriated those voices. Students read a generous amount of literary (and in some cases, musical) works, along with a variety of contemporary theoretical approaches so as to engage in conversation about authorship, classical reception, and materiality. Following an introduction to Greek and Roman texts key for problematic female figures such as sirens and sibyls, we turn to two later historical moments to explore how women artists have both broken out of and used the western canon, redefining genre, content, and style in literary creation writ large. How did Renaissance women such as Laura Cereta, Gaspara Stampa, and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz fashion themselves as authors in light of the classical sources they had at hand? And once we arrive in the 20th and 21st centuries, how do Sibilla Aleramo, Elsa Morante, Anna Maria Ortese, and Elena Ferrante forge a new, feminist writing via classical, queer and/or animal viewpoints?\n",

      "LITR 379 Radical Cinemas in the Global Sixties. Lorenz Hegel, Moira Fradinger. \"1968\" has become a cipher for a moment of global turmoil, social transformation and cultural revolution. This class explores the \"long global sixties\" through cinema produced across continents. At the height of the Cold War between two blocks in the \"East\" and the \"West,\" the \"Third World\" emerged as a radical political project alternative to a world order shaped by centuries of colonialism, imperialism, slavery, and capitalist exploitation. Liberation, emancipation, independence, anticolonialism, decolonization, and revolution became key words in the global political discourse. Leaders from Africa, Asia, and Latin America created a new international platform, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) that challenged the Cold War bi-polarity. Radical filmmakers who belong in this period experimented with strategies of storytelling and of capturing reality, calling into question rigid distinctions between \"documentary\" and \"fiction\" and \"art and politics.\" The goal was not to \"show\" reality, but to change it. We study a world-wide range of examples that involve filmmakers’ collaborations across The Americas, Western Europe, North Africa, South and South-East Asia. Taught in English; films aresubtitled but knowledge of other languages may be useful.\n",

      "LITR 399 Reality and the Realistic. Joanna Fiduccia, Noreen Khawaja. A multidisciplinary exploration of the concept of reality in Euro-American culture. What do we mean when we say something is \"real\" or \"realistic?\" From what is it being differentiated−the imaginary, the surreal, the speculative? Can we approach a meaningful concept of the unreal? This course wagers that representational norms do not simply reflect existing notions of reality; they also shape our idea of reality itself. We study the dynamics of realism and its counterparts across a range of examples from modern art, literature, philosophy, and religion. Readings may include: Aimé Cesaire, Mircea Eliade, Karen Barad, Gustave Flaubert, Sigmund Freud, Renee Gladman, Saidiya Hartman, Arthur Schopenhauer. Our goal is to understand how practices of representation reveal something about our understanding of reality, shedding light on the ways we use this most basic, yet most elusive concept.\n",
      "LITR 410 Interpretations: Simone Weil. Greg Ellermann. Intensive study of the life and work of Simone Weil, one of the twentieth century’s most important thinkers. We read the iconic works that shaped Weil’s posthumous reputation as \"the patron saint of all outsiders,\" including the mystical aphorisms Gravity and Grace and the utopian program for a new Europe The Need for Roots. But we also examine in detail the lesser-known writings Weil published in her lifetime–writings that powerfully intervene in some of the most pressing debates of her day. Reading Weil alongside contemporaries such as Trotsky, Heidegger, Arendt, Levinas, and Césaire, we see how her thought engages key philosophical, ethical, and aesthetic problems of the twentieth century: the relation between dictatorship and democracy; empire and the critique of colonialism; the ethics of attention and affliction; modern science, technology, and the human point of view; the responsibility of the writer in times of war; beauty and the possibility of transcendence; the practice of philosophy as a way of life.\n",

      "LITR 482 The Mortality of the Soul: From Aristotle to Heidegger. Martin Hagglund. This course explores fundamental philosophical questions of the relation between matter and form, life and spirit, necessity and freedom, by proceeding from Aristotle's analysis of the soul in De Anima and his notion of practical agency in the Nicomachean Ethics. We study Aristotle in conjunction with seminal works by contemporary neo-Aristotelian philosophers (Korsgaard, Nussbaum, Brague, and McDowell). We in turn pursue the implications of Aristotle's notion of life by engaging with contemporary philosophical discussions of death that take their point of departure in Epicurus (Nagel, Williams, Scheffler). We conclude by analyzing Heidegger's notion of constitutive mortality, in order to make explicit what is implicit in the form of the soul in Aristotle.\n",

Predicted and observed changes in temperature, pH and salt concentration do and will affect many parameters of the living world, from the kinetics of chemical reactions and cellular signaling pathways to the accumulation of unforeseen chemicals in the environment, the appearance and dispersal of new diseases, and the development of new foods. In this course, we approach climate change from the molecular point of view, identifying how cells and organisms―from microbes to plants and animals―respond to changing environmental conditions. To embrace the concept of \"one health\" for all life on the planet, this course leverages biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biophysics, and genetics to develop an understanding of the impact of climate change on the living world. We consider the foundational knowledge that biochemistry can bring to the table as we meet the challenge of climate change.\n",

For all its reputed (and professed) disdain of the corporeal and earthly, Christianity lavished considerable attention and wealth on the material dimension of sainthood and the \"holy\" during its formative periods in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Already in the second century Christian communities accorded special status to a select few \"friends of God,\" primarily martyrs put to death during Roman persecutions. Subsequently the public and private veneration of saints and their earthly remains proliferated, intensified, and became an intrinsic aspect of Christian spirituality and life in both East and West until the Reformation. To do so, it had to gradually develop a theology to accommodate everything from fingers of saints to controversial and miracle-working images. This course investigates the theology, origins, and development of the cult of saints in early Christianity and the Middle Ages with special attention to its material manifestations. The class combines the examination of thematic issues, such as pilgrimage and the use and function of reliquaries (both portable and architectural), with a focus on such specific cases as the evolution of the cult of the Virgin Mary.\n",

      "MGT 502 Foundations of Accounting & Valuation. Rick Antle. \"Course is designed for non-SOM students and not open to MBA, MAM or MMS students. This course helps you acquire basic accounting and finance knowledge that is extremely useful in the day-to-day practice of general management, consulting, investment banking—virtually any career path that you may pursue. Accounting systems provide important financial information for all types of organizations. Despite their many differences, all accounting systems are built on common foundations. Economic concepts, such as assets, liabilities, and income are used to organize information into a fairly standard set of financial information. Bookkeeping mechanics compile financial information with the double entry system of debits and credits. Accounting conventions help guide the application of the concepts through the mechanics. This course provides these fundamentals of accounting. The financial valuation part of the course helps students to understand the financial environment in which firms operate and the concepts that need to be mastered in order to make decisions that benefit the stakeholders of a typical organization. The time value of money and net present values and their application to the valuation of bonds and stocks, the trade-off of risk and return in financial markets, the computation of the cost of obtaining capital for investment, and how firms balance the use of equity and debt to finance their activities, are all topics to be considered in this class. The course has been specifically designed to provide the requisite fundamentals of accounting and valuation for students that do not currently have access to SOM’s core courses. The aim has been to provide an introduction to the material relied upon by elective courses.\"\"\"\n",

Does this microfinance project seeking funding from my organization reduce poverty? Should I hold back my child a year before they start school? Will the outcome of the next election affect the value of my stock portfolio? This course will examine when and how data can be used specifically to infer whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. We will emphasize the role of theory in interpreting data and guiding analysis, and explore advanced techniques for inferring causality, including: regression discontinuity designs; matching estimators; instrumental variables; synthetic controls; event studies; heterogeneity modeling; audit studies; randomized controlled trials; natural experiments (and unnatural experiments); and A/B testing. Lectures will contain some proofs and derivations (only calculus is required), but the emphasis will be on understanding the underlying concepts, and the practical use, implications and limitations of these techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers and producers of convincing causal empirical analysis.\"\"\"\n",

The course will also provide a set of analytical tools required to understand and critically \"consume\" empirical academic research, as well as public commentary and policy, related to this topic. Class sessions are a mixture of lectures and discussion based on assigned readings. Assessment will be based on class participation, one/ two assignments, and a final project.\n",
      "MGT 538 Mastering Influence & Persuasion. Zoe Chance. Set the stage for achieving your goals through ongoing mastery of influence and persuasion in a boot camp-style intensive course. Help you become a person people increasingly want to say yes to. Whether you have formal authority or not, your effectiveness as a leader and change agent depends on your ability to influence others to want to follow you. To want to say Yes. In this boot camp practicum, you'll study research findings and discuss tools like handling resistance and using other people's standards for themselves, but the real work and real benefit happens outside of class. You'll put influence into practice with weekly G-Force challenges to help you gain useful skills, shift your thinking, and build resilience. Although you'll learn some red flags to watch out for so you can protect yourself against would-be manipulators, and we'll discuss how to handle difficult people, we focus on making influence more comfortable and fun for all parties. Because then you'll be more likely to use it. Which means you'll be a stronger leader, better able to shape the world around you. Research shows nice people DO finish first—but \"\"nice\"\" might be different from what you thought. Find out for yourself.\n",

This course offers a systems analysis approach to describe and explain the basics of energy systems, including all forms of energy (fossil and renewable), all sectors/activities of energy production/conversion, and all end-uses, irrespective of the form of market transaction (commercial or noncommercial) or form of technology (traditional as well as novel advanced concepts) deployed. Students gain a comprehensive theoretical and empirical knowledge base from which to analyze energy-environmental issues as well as to participate effectively in policy debates. Special attention is given to introduce students to formal methods used to analyze energy systems or individual energy projects and to discuss also traditionally lesser-researched elements of energy systems (energy use in developing countries; energy densities and urban energy use; income, gender, and lifestyle differences in energy end-use patterns) in addition to currently dominant energy issues such as energy security and climate change. Active student participation is encouraged, including voluntary (extra credit) research projects with class presentations and participation in student debates. Completion of 6 problem sets and a final written exam are mandatory. Invited external speakers complement topics covered in class. This is a cross-listed course from the School of Forestry.\n",
      "MGT 582 The Future of Global Finance. Jeffrey Garten. This course is open to graduate students throughout Yale and to seniors in Yale College. The only prerequisite is an undergraduate or graduate course on macroeconomics. Please note that in order to enroll in the course, you must attend the first class meeting. Additionally, please note that there will be an assignment due prior to the first class. Course description: Finance can be likened to the circulatory system of the global economy, and we will focus on the past, present and future of that system. The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators and international organizations. Thus we will encompass subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We will take a broad view of the GFS including its history, its geopolitical framework, its economic foundations and its legal underpinnings. We will consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We will look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long term investments in infrastructure. We will discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We will examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis will be on the practice of global finance more than the theory.\n",

      "MGT 611 Policy Modeling. Edward H Kaplan. Policy modeling refers to applications of operations research and allied quantitative methods to policy problems. Policy modeling is most useful when the amounts of data, money, time, and other resources one would like for purely scientific investigation are highly constrained by the decision-making environment. Recognizing that analyses of all sorts often exhibit diminishing returns in insight to effort, the idea is to capture key features of various policy issues with relatively simple \"first-strike\" models that provide support for decision making. Building on earlier coursework in probability modeling, decision analysis and economics, the techniques introduced include \"back of the envelope\" probabilistic models such as Bernoulli, Poisson, Markov and elementary renewal processes, hazard functions, queueing theory, and epidemic modeling. Simple cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness approaches are integrated with the above. This year the course will feature several applications to the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2, the causal virus of COVID-19, in addition to problems drawn from other areas of public health, criminal justice, public housing, and counterterrorism. Students will be responsible for attending lectures and reading assigned articles. There will be weekly problem sets which must be submitted on-time to receive credit, and a take-home exam scheduled for the latter part of the semester. Prerequisite: Students must have completed MGT 403 (Probability Modeling and Statistics) or equivalent to take this class. The probability modeling knowledge required is covered in any introductory probability course and includes: sample space, event probabilities including marginal, joint and conditional, Bayes' Rule, random variables, probability distributions, expected value, mean, variance, Bernoulli, binomial, uniform, and normal random variables, joint distributions, independence, covariance and correlation, sums of random variables (both independent and dependent), central limit theorem, and sampling distributions. Policy modeling is not a class in statistics or econometrics.\n",

      "MGT 612 Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship. Teresa Chahine. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to practice social entrepreneurship? You don't have to found your own company to make a difference. Everyone can learn from the social entrepreneurship mindset and skillset, and apply it in their own way to create social impact. In this course, we combine theory and practice, applying a systematic framework to guide students through the social entrepreneurship experience. We start by identifying a social or environmental challenge each student is interested in tackling. Students form interdisciplinary teams to immerse themselves in characterizing the challenge, ideating potential solutions, and building business models around those solutions. Social Entrepreneurship Lab is a safe space to experiment, iterate, prototype, test, and fail. You don't need to launch your venture, though some teams will. You'll meet alumni who launched new ventures; and social entrepreneurs from New Haven and around the world. All students are welcome; no prior experience necessary.\n",

      "MGT 629 Ethical Choices in Public Leadership. Eric Braverman. The application for this course will be available through Jackson and won't be posted until August. All public leaders must make choices that challenge their code of ethics. Sometimes, a chance of life or death is literally at stake: how and when should a leader decide to let some people die, or explicitly ask people to die to give others a chance to live? At other times, while life or death may not be at stake, a leader must still decide difficult issues: when to partner with unsavory characters, when to admit failure, when to release information or make choices transparent. The pandemic today makes clearer than ever the consequences of decisions in one community that can affect the entire world. This interdisciplinary seminar draws on perspectives from law, management, and public policy in exploring how leaders develop their principles, respond when their principles fail or conflict, and make real-world choices when, in fact, there are no good choices. Application ONLY: visit https://jackson.yale.edu/academics/registrar/ in August to apply. Attendance at first session is mandatory. Location: Horchow Hall, 55 Hillhouse Avenue Course dates/times: Fridays, 8:30-11:15am on Sept 8, 15, 29, Oct. 13, Nov 3, 17, Dec 1 AND on Thursday Nov 30, 6:00-8:00pm.\n",

Please submit a statement of interest to rhona.ceppos@yale.edu including relevant course work and experience (see below). Applications are due by August 18, 2023. Students will be informed of their acceptance by August 25, 2023. In this interdisciplinary clinic taught between the School of Architecture, School of Law, and School of Management, and organized by the Yale Urban Design Workshop, students will gain hands-on, practical experience in architectural and urban development and social entrepreneurship while contributing novel, concrete solutions to the housing affordability crisis in Connecticut. Working in teams directly with local community-based non-profits, students will co-create detailed development proposals and architectural designs anchored by affordable housing, but which will also engage with a range of community development issues including environmental justice, sustainability, resilience, social equity, identity, food scarcity, mobility, and health. Through seminars and workshops with Yale faculty and guest practitioners, students will be introduced to the history, theory, issues, and contemporary practices in the field, and will get direct feedback on their work. Offered in partnership with the Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) as part of the Connecticut Plan for Healthy Cities, student projects will center on community wealth building and equitable economic recovery in some of Connecticut’s most economically distressed neighborhoods, by proposing multi-sector, place-based projects that focus on housing, health, and economic development. Proposals will have the opportunity to receive funding from the State both towards the implementation of rapidly deployed pilot projects during the course period, as well as towards predevelopment activities for larger projects, such as housing rehabilitation or new building construction. Students in the course will be organized into multi-disciplinary teams including law, management, and architecture students, who will ideate together and take on specific team roles, modeling real-world project development teams. Teams will be assigned to work with non-profit developers tackling development or redevelopment projects that include affordable housing. Facilities of the Yale Urban Design Workshop will be available to students of the course. Students may have the opportunity to continue their leadership in these projects following the end of the course, in a professional capacity, as they move towards implementation. Students will interact with their nonprofit partners, the Connecticut Commissioner of Housing, Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, and the Connecticut Green Bank. Projected Enrollment: 12 Architecture, 6 Law, 6 Management Law prerequisites: Please indicate in your statement of interest whether you have previously taken Property, Land Use Law, Local Government Law, the Community and Economic Development Clinic, or the Housing Clinic.

Architecture prerequisites: M.Arch I students in their second or third year, and M.Arch II students in any year are eligible.\n",
      "MGT 633 GlobalLdrshp:TopicsinBus&Socty. Robert Jensen. \"One of the biggest problems in business today is short-termism. The same, incidentally, is true for politics. Quarterly earnings, the 24hr news cycle, and social media blips command much of if not most attention. Yet the opportunity set facing business is overwhelmingly shaped by broad macro-trends and systemic risks – call them \"big issues.\" Climate change, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and urbanization are just some of the trends that will make some industries rise while others fall; challenge managers to reinvent their companies, products, and even themselves; and provide exciting opportunities for global leaders who are change agents and entrepreneurs. At the same time, because of business’s ability to adapt to and even steer major change, many stakeholders are looking to the business community to help solve global problems. To meet stakeholder expectations, and to ultimately convert global challenges into business opportunities, aspiring leaders must understand an array of issues that extend far beyond traditional business concerns. Only then can they create ‘shared value’ at the nexus of business and society. This course is designed to foster participants’ ability to think more holistically about globalization, global trends, and the role of business. It is structured around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 objectives, backed up by 169 specific targets, that were adopted by the UN in 2015 after broad-based consultations involving governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and the business community.\"\n",
      "MGT 636 Global Leadership: Increasing Personal and Interpersonal Effectiveness. David Tate. Leaders for business and society need an array of competencies, but for leaders who work in global/multinational environments, there are additional skills, abilities, and knowledge needed to be successful. This course is designed to help students learn about and practice the mindsets and skills necessary to be more flexible, resilient, and confident when working across geographic, interpersonal and cultural contexts. The central focus is to increase students’ personal and interpersonal skills necessary for more effective leadership in global contexts.\n",
      "MGT 637 Social Innovation Starter. Teresa Chahine. This course is about experiencing social innovation. Over the course of the semester, students form innovation teams working with real-world organizations representing multiple topic areas including health, education, climate, civic engagement, and other topics. We will apply the ten-stage framework of the textbook \"Social Entrepreneurship: Building Impact Step by Step.\" Partner organizations are social enterprises or other social purpose organizations based globally and locally who present Yale students with a problem statement to work on over the course of one semester. This could include creating new programs or products, reaching new populations, measuring the impact of existing work, creating new communications tools for existing work, or other challenges. Students gain social innovation and entrepreneurship experience, and partner organizations benefit from students’ problem solving. Students from all programs and concentrations at Yale are welcome to join Jackson students in forming inter-disciplinary teams to tackle social and environmental challenges. This course runs during the same semester as the Social Entrepreneurship Lab at Yale School of Management, which is also cross-listed. The key distinction is that in the former, students pick their own topic to research and ideate on, whereas in this course students work on projects for existing organizations. Jackson students may elect to follow up on this course with an independent study and/or summer internship with the partner organization, to help support implementation of their solution, if the partner organization and the school administration accepts their application.\n",

      "MGT 659 Business Organizations. Jonathan Macey. An introduction to the business corporation laws affecting the rights and roles of corporate boards of directors, senior executive officers, and shareholders, with attention to both large, publicly traded firms and to closely-held companies. Shareholders' economic interests are examined from the perspective of limited liability and dividend standards, expectations of liquidity or transferability of shares, and the use of debt capital as a mode of financing corporate activity. Shareholders' limited participation rights in corporate decision making will be examined from the perspective of state and federal rules governing shareholder voting and the disclosure of corporate information and the notion of managerial expertise (e.g., as evidenced by judicial application of the \"business judgment rule\"). The latter part of the course will focus on directors' and officers' fiduciary obligations to shareholders, examining the operation of these duties in a variety of settings and transactions. Issues relating to the roles and functions assumed by corporate attorneys (with respect to their clients) and the role of business corporations within society will also be addressed.\n",

      "MGT 676 Just Energy Transitions. Andre de Ruyter. The necessity of accelerating decarbonisation of coal-based power systems to counteract anthropomorphic global warming is obvious from a rational and scientific perspective. Implementing this in practice is a major challenge having regard to the incumbency of coal-fired generation. In this course, using a combined framework of the energy trilemma and an ever-narrowing focus on geopolitical, regional, and local issues, including matters such as resource nationalism and perceived global iniquities, CBAM and historical emission and growth patterns, are explored. At an energy-system level, the need for dispatchable electricity to maintain a constant frequency on the grid, additional storage, and grid strengthening are explored to illustrate the complexity of greening a fossil-dominated electricity system. At a social level, challenges with reskilling and upskilling coal value chain workers are considered, as well as the challenges of legacy assets, and the cost of decommissioning and rehabilitation. A South African JET project is considered to understand the challenges at national, regional, and grassroots levels; how incumbent value chains have legitimate concerns; and what ameliorative steps can be taken to ensure that the transition is as just as possible. The impacts on employment, public health, water consumption, and regional development are considered. Deployment of renewable energy does not always coincide with the location of coal-fired assets and transmission grids, further complicating efforts to render the transition a just one.\n",

      "MGT 834 Strategic Organizational Design and Implementation. Gautam Mukunda. Designed for individuals at any stage of their career, this course is meant to debunk the fallacies that we have about power and to explore the fundamentals of power in interpersonal relationships, in organizations, and in society. In doing so, we will lift the veil on power, revealing what it really is, and how it works, ultimately unleashing your potential to build and use power to effect change. It is meant for those who want to make things happen, despite the obstacles that might stand in the way. This course is also intended to prepare you to use power responsibly as well as to understand its corruptive perils, both for yourself and those around you. As such, it will equip you to challenge the status quo in order to address some of the most pressing social and environmental problems of our time, from fighting racism to reducing economic inequalities, saving the planet, and protecting democracy. The course introduces conceptual models, tactical approaches, and assessment tools to help you develop your own influence style and understand political dynamics as they unfold around you. By focusing on specific expressions of power and influence, this course will give you the opportunity to observe effective—and ineffective—uses of power in different contexts and stages of a person’s career. The subject matter will challenge you to define for yourself what constitutes the ethical exercise of power and influence in your life. The course builds on the book \"Power, For All: How It Really Works and Why It’s Everyone’s Business\" (Simon & Schuster, 2021), written by Julie Battilana and Tiziana Casciaro. Some of the chapters of the book will be assigned together with other readings throughout the course, but you do not need to have read the book (except for the introduction that will be an assigned reading for the first session) before the beginning of class. The list of readings and the detailed schedule of each of the course sessions will be posted in September, which will give you ample time to prepare before the beginning of the course.\n",

Global investment in financial assets, the need for risk diversification, the increased accuracy of property records, greater transparency, more relaxed laws permitting foreign investment, and population movement around the world—all of these trends have led to a tremendous increase in cross-border real estate investing for both private equity and public companies. While many studies of international real estate focus on the role of foreign real property in the U. S. institutional portfolio, this course will take a wider and more historical view of the cultural attitudes towards real estate around the world and how they impact the quality and risk of investment assets. Detailed analysis will begin with property level due diligence in order to provide a fundamental understanding of how and why property markets differ by country beyond simple supply/demand dynamics. This course will consist of three parts: a.) a micro-market analysis of real property characteristics in various countries around the world, including financing, leasing and valuation; b.) an analysis of investment vehicles—public and private—available to institutional investors, as well as cross-border transactions, and c.) a macro-market view of world space and capital markets, the rationale for international investing, trends in capital flows and portfolio composition and the various ways in which risk is measured and mitigated. Each part of the course will require a brief individual assignment completed over a two-week period. The first research project will be a study of a significant real property asset outside of the United States, including its market, ownership, legal structure, valuation, and transaction history. Both the G-8 and G-20 nations will be the object of study, but individual students are free to concentrate on any country of interest. The second research project will consist of an analysis of a private equity or publicly-traded foreign property company, its current fair value, competitive advantage and future prospects. An interview with a top executive of a company will be encouraged and facilitated. The third research project will consist of a comparative analysis of world property markets and the hypothetical investment in a portfolio of real estate assets across three or more foreign property markets.

      "MHHR 700 Theory and Praxis of Material Histories. Lucy Mulroney, Priyasha Mukhopadhyay. This year-long workshop focuses on the concepts, debates, methodologies, theories, and real-world constraints of the material histories of the human record across a range of formats and media. Organized around six rubrics—Collecting, Describing, Displaying, Embodying, Disembodying, and Representing—we aim to cut across long-standing divides between collections, archives and libraries, on the hand, and scholarly/artistic spaces of the academic world; between preservation and consumption; between privacy and publicity; between the social sciences and the humanities. Through critical readings that engage with diverse geographic and temporal subjects; the close analysis and physical handling of rare books, maps, manuscripts, images, objects, and textiles; and an orientation to cultural heritage and library professional practices and procedures, students learn the critical interventions of the history of the book and the archival turn in the humanities; the key concepts and genealogies of archives and library special collections; and the generative collaborations currently underway between faculty and librarians to jointly address legacies of racism and white privilege, advance intellectual freedom and parity, and define the ethical stewardship of the material histories of the human record today. This workshop takes the form of a half-credit course in each semester that meets six times a term (every other week). This course must be taken before or after MHHR 701 to earn 1 full credit. We welcome all curious students to the first class, but permission of the instructors is subsequently required for enrollment/registration.\n",

Students learn how to use vocabulary (or musical phrases) and a variety of improvisational devices and techniques over common chords and chord progressions. Upon completion of the course students have a deeper understanding of what it takes to become a great improviser, what to practice and how to practice it, and how to go about expanding their jazz vocabulary in order to naturally develop a unique improvisational voice. Students are required to bring their instruments to class; additionally, a basic understanding of jazz nomenclature and some experience improvising are advised. Grades are based on completion of two to three solo transcription assignments (with one being committed to memory), two melody composition assignments, several small projects and assignments, one to two quizzes, class attendance, and each student’s personal development. Students do not need the instructor's permission to add the course to their schedule.

Students select a composition from the standard repertoire that is relevant to them, as well as a composition by a living composer from an underrepresented population; identify and evaluate performing editions (three maximum) and recordings (three maximum) of each that represent the most authoritative version as well as the least; maintain a research journal by way of weekly course assignments and essays; build an annotated bibliography of resources used; and provide documented findings to support the evaluations and articulate the reasons for their selections clearly, and to compare the amount and types of resources that are available for research for each of the two compositions selected, both in writing and as a final presentation to the class.\n",

The course includes a study of jazz’s artists/styles from the 1880s through the 1970s; an examination of the social, racial, gendered, and economic factors that gave rise to jazz styles; and how jazz developmental patterns are represented in today’s popular music. This introductory course may be redundant for students who have already had significant studies in jazz history. Students with some knowledge of jazz history may want to take this course to help them develop their own curriculum in preparation for teaching a similar course in the future. Course work is done through a combination of online work, short essays, group discussion, and reading assignments.\n",
      "MUS 582 French Sounds: Music from Debussy to Dalbavie. Stephanie Venturino. 4 credits. NP. Group A or B. What makes French music of the past century—despite its stylistic diversity—sound distinctly French? This course, covering the evolution of music in France from the fin de siècle to the turn of the millennium, addresses this question from analytical, theoretical, and historical angles. Course modules focus on French approaches to tonality, harmony, resonance, pitch organization, melody, ornament, rhythm, timbre, and sound qualities. Students will also explore connections between French music and other subject areas, including visual art, dance, and philosophy. Repertoire covers a wide variety of styles and instrumentations; composers include Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Cécile Chaminade, Lili Boulanger, Edgard Varèse, André Jolivet, Germaine Tailleferre, Darius Milhaud, Maurice Ohana, Olivier Messiaen, Henri Dutilleux, Pierre Boulez, Gérard Grisey, Éliane Radigue, Betsy Jolas, and Marc-André Dalbavie, among others.

      "MUS 585 Sonata Form in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Seth Monahan. 4 credits. NP. Group A. This course explores the emergence and subsequent development of sonata form as a vehicle for creative expression in the instrumental music of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe. Through close engagement with dozens of individual movements, we will come to understand both the essential mechanics of the form itself and the dazzling variety of subtypes, adaptions, and offshoots that arose over successive generations. Zooming out, we will also consider methodological issues that attend the analysis of musical form, up to and including the vexed question of what musical forms actually are and the role they play in the creative imagination of individual artists. In the end, we shall come to understand sonata form not as a fixed \"blueprint\" or \"mold,\" but as a dynamic and constantly-evolving means of structuring musical arguments—one that placed composers in a dialogue with the past while spurring some of their highest and most enduring achievements. Course requirements include weekly listening, reading, and analytical work; three brief response papers (1–4 pages), occasional oral presentations, and a final oral examination on topics chosen by the student.\n",

      "MUS 617 Music and Theology in the Sixteenth Century. Markus Rathey. 4 credits. NP. Group B. The Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century was a \"media event.\" The invention of letterpress printing, the partisanship of famous artists like Dürer and Cranach, and—not least—the support of many musicians and composers were responsible for the spreading of the thoughts of Reformation. But while Luther gave an important place to music, Zwingli and Calvin were much more skeptical. Music, especially sacred music, constituted a problem because it was tightly connected with Catholic liturgical and aesthetic traditions. Reformers had to think about the place music could have in worship and about the function of music in secular life.\n",

In addition to hearing and discussing music by composers from Hildegard of Bingen through Caroline Shaw, the course considers the various roles women have played in the wider cultural history of Western art music: as professional and amateur performers, teachers and students, music printers and collectors, listeners, curators, and patrons.

      "MUS 656 Liturgical Keyboard Skills I. 2 credits. In this course, students gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for musical genres, both those familiar to them and those different from their own, and learn basic techniques for their application in church service playing. Students learn to play hymns, congregational songs, service music, and anthems from a variety of sources, including music from the liturgical and free church traditions, including the Black Church experience. Hymn playing, with an emphasis on methods of encouraging congregational singing, is the principal focus of the organ instruction, but there is also instruction in chant and anthem accompaniment, including adapting a piano reduction to the organ. In the gospel style, beginning with the piano, students are encouraged to play by ear, using their aural skills in learning gospel music. This training extends to the organ, in the form of improvised introductions and varied accompaniments to hymns of all types. We seek to accomplish these goals by active participation and discussion in class. When not actually playing in class, students are encouraged to sing to the accompaniment of the person at the keyboard, to further their experience of singing with accompaniment, and to give practical encouragement to the person playing.\n",

      "MUSI 006 Musical Genius. Lindsay Wright. Is there such a thing as \"musical genius\"? What exactly are the qualifications, and who gets to decide? In this course, we explore how the answers to these questions have shifted in the past three centuries, investigating when and where—and especially how and why—the notion of musical genius became so pervasive and powerful. To this end, class discussions draw upon a range of materials: we listen to music; parse primary historical sources; analyze news coverage and podcast episodes; and read from a range of academic subfields, including music history, ethnomusicology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, disability studies, critical race studies, gender and sexuality studies, and music education. We compare and critically analyze discourse about a range of figures dubbed musical geniuses, from L. v. Beethoven and W. A. Mozart to Thomas \"Blind Tom\" Wiggins, Aretha Franklin, and Vijay Iyer. Building upon this historical context, we also interrogate the significance of musical genius in today’s world, considering the proliferation of genius-themed self-help literature, the politics and procedures of the Macarthur Genius Grant, invocations of genius and talent on social media, and additional issues of interest to students. Beyond gaining a robust understanding of the history of ideas like genius and talent, we contemplate the benefits and challenges of conceptual history as a scholarly enterprise more broadly.\n",
      "MUSI 032 Music, Sound, and the Environment. Giulia Accornero. The word \"environment\" derives from the French word environ (around): it refers to what is all around us. In this class we examine the roles that music, sound, and their associated vocabularies have long played in negotiating the perception and meaning of what constitutes our environment. We dig into history to learn how the Muslim philosopher al-Kindī conceived of the connection between winds, elements, and the strings of the oud more than a thousand years ago; how across the centuries, people have construed a range of musical genres in connection to the problematic ideology of climatic determinism; and how today, composers give voice to the microscopic. As we proceed, we ask: what is (and could be) the role of music and sound in shaping the environment today? By the end of the class, we recognize and assess the ways in which music and sound have inflected and continue to inflect our perception of the environment.\n",
      "MUSI 040 Bob Dylan as a Way of Life. Benjamin Barasch. An introduction to college-level study of the humanities through intensive exploration of the songs of Bob Dylan. We touch on Dylan’s place in American cultural history but mostly treat him as a great creative artist, tracking him through various guises and disguises across his sixty-year odyssey of self-fashioning, from ‘60s folk revivalist to voice of social protest, abrasive rock ‘n’ roll surrealist to honey-voiced country crooner, loving husband to lovesick drifter, secular Jew to born-again Christian to worldly skeptic, honest outlaw to Nobel Prize-winning chronicler of modern times and philosopher of song. Throughout, we attend to Dylan’s lifelong quest for wisdom and reflect on how it can inspire our own. Topics include: the elusiveness of identity and the need for selfhood; virtue and vice; freedom and servitude; reverence and irreverence; love, desire, and betrayal; faith and unbelief; aging, death, and the possibility of immortality; the authentic and the counterfeit; the nature of beauty and of artistic genius; the meaning of personal integrity in a political world.\n",
      "MUSI 054 Performing Antiquity. This seminar introduces students to some of the most influential texts of Greco-Roman Antiquity and investigates the meaning of their \"performance\" in different ways: 1) how they were musically and dramatically performed in their original context in Antiquity (what were the rhythms, the harmonies, the dance-steps, the props used, etc.); 2) what the performance meant, in socio-cultural and political terms, for the people involved in performing or watching it, and how performance takes place beyond the stage; 3) how these texts are performed in modern times (what it means for us to translate and stage ancient plays with masks, a chorus, etc.; to reenact some ancient institutions; to reconstruct ancient instruments or compose \"new ancient music\"); 4) in what ways modern poems, plays, songs, ballets constitute forms of interpretation, appropriation, or contestation of ancient texts; 5) in what ways creative and embodied practice can be a form of scholarship. Besides reading ancient Greek and Latin texts in translation, students read and watch performances of modern works of reception: poems, drama, ballet, and instrumental music. A few sessions are devoted to practical activities (reenactment of a symposium, composition of ancient music, etc.).\n",

Readings and discussions focus primarily on the British New Wave (from about 1979 to 1985) and K-Pop (1992-present), but we also discuss first-wave reggae, ska, rocksteady from the 1960s-70s, British and American punk rock music (1970s-1980s), the precursors of modern K-Pop, and have a brief discussion of Japanese City Pop. The class focuses mainly on the British New Wave and K-Pop because these two genres of popular music have strong ties to particular geographic areas, but they became or have become extremely popular in other parts of the world. We also investigate the importance of music videos in the development of these genres.\n",

      "MUSI 137 Western Philosophy in Four Operas 1600-1900. Gary Tomlinson. This course intensively study\\ies four operas central to the western repertory, spanning the years from the early 17th to the late 19th century: Monteverdi's Orfeo, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Wagner's Die Walküre (from The Ring of the Nibelungs), and Verdi's Simon Boccanegra. The course explores the expression in these works of philosophical stances of their times on the human subject and human society, bringing to bear writings contemporary to them as well as from more recent times. Readings include works of Ficino, Descartes, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Douglass, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Adorno. We discover that the expression of changing philosophical stances can be found not only in dramatic themes and the words sung, but in the changing natures of the musical styles deployed.\n",

The course focuses on meter, durational rhythm, their interaction across short and long spans of musical time, and their capacity to shape musical form. Repertories are drawn from various historical eras of notated European music;  contemporary  popular, jazz ,and electronic dance music; and contemporary and traditional musics of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. Students acquire a deeper understanding of a fundamental human capacity, as well as specific tools and habits that can be put to use in various activities as performers, composers, improvisers, listeners, and dancers.\n",

      "MUSI 450 Black Arts Criticism: Intellectual Life of Black Culture from W.E.B. DuBois to the 21st Century. Daphne Brooks. This course traces the birth and evolution of Black arts writing and criticism−its style and content, its major themes and groundbreaking practices−from the late nineteenth century through the 2020s. From the innovations of W.E.B. DuBois, Pauline Hopkins, and postbellum Black arts journalists to the breakthroughs of Harlem Renaissance heavyweights (Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and others), from the jazz experimentalism of Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray to the revolutionary criticism of Amiri Baraka, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Phyl Garland and others, this class explores the intellectual work of pioneering writers who produced radical knowledge about Black culture. Its second half turns to the late twentieth and twenty-first century criticism of legendary arts journalists, scholars and critics: Toni Morrison, Thulani Davis, Margo Jefferson, Hilton Als, Greg Tate, Farah J.

      "MUSI 464 American Opera Today: Explorations of a Burgeoning Industry. Allison Chu, Gundula Kreuzer. Contemporary opera constitutes one of the most vibrant sectors of classical music in the United States today. The past decade has seen a range of experimental performances that excitingly challenge stylistic and generic boundaries, and a widening spectrum of creators have been reaching to opera as a medium to center and (re)present stories of historically marginalized communities. Beyond introducing students to the richness of this new repertory, the seminar addresses the broad socio-political and economic currents underlying these recent changes in American opera, including institutional and funding structures; the role of PR, criticism, awards, and other taste-making agents; and cultural reckonings with systemic racism, engrained injustices, and white supremacy. A selection of recent operas or scenes—available as video recordings or audio files—allows us to explore aesthetic issues, such as narrative structures, diverse treatments of the (singing) voice, embodiment, interactivity, immersion, the role of digital media, mobility, site-specificity, and new online formats for opera. Students learn how to write about contemporary performances and works for which little scholarship is yet available; practice both public-facing and academic writing; recognize and critique contemporary canon-formation processes; and relate contemporary artistic practices to a larger institutional and economic ecosystem. At least one trip to the Metropolitan Opera is anticipated, for Anthony Davis and Thulani Davis’ X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X.\n",
      "MUSI 479 Music, Exile, and Diaspora─the Jews of Arab Lands. Ilana Webster-Kogen. Exile has been the defining characteristic of Jewish culture for most of Jewish history. Sephardic and (more recently called) Mizrahi Jews across the Arab world developed unique languages, rituals, and musical styles that continued to grow following dramatic expulsions like those in 1492 or following 1948. In turn, Jewish musicians often shaped the soundworlds of their host cultures even as they continued to move across and around the Mediterranean. This class considers the musical styles of the Jews of Arab lands through the experience of exile and diaspora. We focus on the itineraries of Jewish musicians and musical styles that travelled from Babylonia, Yemen, and medieval Spain, through Livorno, Fez and Baghdad, and continue to live on today in Jerusalem, Casablanca and Brooklyn. We examine the musical framing of diaspora, and how the movement of people changes the way groups come to reframe music as memory. We also consider ritual and text, and the way each shapes intimate and sacred spaces. Thinking about some musical styles that have faded away and some that continue to flourish, we re-center the Jewish experience around its Sephardic/Mizrahi history, with multiple routes of movement and memory.\n",
      "MUSI 480 Music of the Caribbean: Cuba and Jamaica. Michael Veal.

Prominent themes include: slavery, Afro-diasporic cultural traditions, Black Atlantic culture, nationalism/independence/post-colonial culture, relationships with the United States, music & gender/sexuality, technology.\n",
      "MUSI 494 Remapping Dance. Amanda Reid, Ameera Nimjee, Rosa van Hensbergen. What does it mean to be at home in a body? What does it mean to move freely, and what kinds of bodies are granted that right? How is dance encoded as bodies move between various sites? In this team-taught class, we remap the field of dance through its migratory routes to understand how movement is shaped by the connections and frictions of ever-changing communities. As three dance scholars, bringing specialisms in West Indian dance, South Asian dance, and East Asian dance, we are looking to decenter the ways in which dance is taught, both in what we teach and in the ways we teach. Many of the dancers we follow create art inspired by migration, exile, and displacement (both within and beyond the nation) to write new histories of political belonging. Others trace migratory routes through mediums, ideologies, and technologies. The course is structured around four units designed to invite the remapping of dance through its many spaces of creativity: The Archive, The Studio, The Field, and The Stage. Throughout, we explore how different ideas of virtuosity, risk, precarity, radicalism, community, and solidarity are shaped by space and place. We rethink how local dance economies are governed by world markets and neoliberal funding models and ask how individual bodies can intervene in these global systems.\n",

      "MUSI 511 Sounding Contemporary. Ameera Nimjee. What does it mean to \"sound contemporary\"? Conversely, what does \"contemporary\" sound like? Why does this matter? The premise for this seminar is that making sense of contemporary discourse is an avenue into how and why people make performance, which includes music, dance, and spaces that are created from sound and movement. Course texts and material come from theoretical writings, experiential commentaries, performances, and ethnography, inciting topical study on how contemporary performance interacts and is produced by structures of power, including race, gender, class, and caste. Students are expected to create connections between assigned course materials and topics in class discussions, with the goal of constructing larger dialogues on epistemologies and consequences of sounding contemporary.\n",
      "MUSI 613 Global Approaches to Music Studies. Daniel Walden. What is the so-called \"global turn\" in music scholarship all about—and what would it mean to \"think globally?\"  This seminar focuses on the explosion of global epistemologies that has appeared in scholarship within the past several decades, starting from the field of history and spilling into the various subdisciplines of music studies: musicology, music theory, and ethnomusicology. We think critically about the promises and pitfalls of this evolving branch of research, as well as the challenges of writing from a global perspective—including reckoning with the politics of translation and commensuration, matters of scale and scope, the dynamics of collaboration, and questions of positionality and expertise, among other matters. Broader disciplinary concerns, particularly pedagogy and decolonialism, are also be at the forefront of our discussions. The course is divided loosely into three parts. We begin with a broad survey of the field, followed by a close examination of six models for global historiography that have featured in music scholarship: contact zones, border studies, transnationalism and transculturality, historical anthropology, comparativism, and micro- and macro- deep history. We end with four sessions devoted to exploring recurrent issues—colonialism, media, the planetary, pedagogy—followed by presentations of final projects.\n",

      "MUSI 838 Music and Posthumanism. Gary Tomlinson. Several years ago, in an essay positing directions for a musical posthumanism, I wrote that \"the posthumanist’s aim must be to destabilize the human enclosure, shaping posthumanist theory as something like a novel type or engine of critique, not another object for it\" (\"Posthumanism,\" The Oxford Handbook of Western Music and Philosophy, 2020). The puzzle of musical posthumanism is a deep one if we are to take seriously this destabilizing move. This seminar investigates from several vantages—transspecies, technological, critical, and philosophical—varieties of musical posthumanism. How has the human organism been technologically and molded to musicking and recorded sound? What might the future of such molding hold, and what role will AI engines play in this? What, conversely, is the posthumanist potential of deep, evolutionary histories of music? What kind of theoretical purchase might enable us to move beyond conventional humanisms in considering music, reaching out to communication systems—putative musics—of nonhuman species? Can we approach in musical posthumanism a universal musicology, parallel to a universal biology? If so, what is the relation of such an approach to a musicology that has been for at least forty years determined to understand human cultural difference and particularity. Readings include, inter alia, work by Abbate, Chua and Rehding, Cox, Kane, Steingo, Tomlinson, Trippett, van der Schyff, and Watkins.\n",
      "MUSI 909 Arts of Fugue. Daniel Harrison. The seminar examines theoretical and analytical issues associated with fugal procedures, ca. 1650–1950, with special focus on the work of J.S. Bach.

      "NELC 002 The Discovery of Egypt and Europe's Age of Enlightenment. Nadine Moeller. European interest in Egypt extends back to the 17th century and was fueled simultaneously by the idea of the mysterious Orient as well as the Enlightenment drive to explain through science and reason the birth and rise of human civilization. While Egyptian exploration can be traced to as early as the Renaissance, it was during the Age of Enlightenment that European states sent research expeditions to explore the intriguing monuments and edifices along the Nile. This course explores the intellectual, political, and socio-economic background of Europe’s discovery of Egypt during the Age of Enlightenment. We also investigate the early years of a new scientific discipline called Egyptology, and its influence on archaeology, another Enlightenment-born discipline aiming to explain humanity through scientific methods. The learning goals for students are (a) to practice analytic skills to 'excavate' the reasoning, pre-conceptions, and attitudes of the first explorers and scientists to travel to Egypt, and (b) to reflect, through written and classroom assignments, on the cultural and historical impact of ‘Egyptomania’ on fashion, art, and architecture, and the ensuing plunder of Egyptian cultural heritage to satisfy European demand.\n",
      "NELC 007 Six Pretty Good Heroes. Kathryn Slanski. Focusing on the figure of the hero through different eras, cultures, and media, this course provides first-year students with a reading-and writing-intensive introduction to studying the humanities at Yale. The course is anchored around six transcultural models of the hero that similarly transcend boundaries of time and place: the warrior, the sage, the political leader, the proponent of justice, the poet/singer, and the unsung. Our sources range widely across genres, media, periods, and geographies: from the ancient Near Eastern, Epic of Gilgamesh (1500 BCE) to the Southeast Asian Ramayana, to the Icelandic-Ukrainian climate activism film, Woman at War (2018). As part of the Six Pretty Good suite, we explore Yale's special collections and art galleries to broaden our perspectives on hierarchies of value and to sharpen our skills of observation and working with evidence. Six Pretty Good Heroes is a 1.5 credit course, devoting sustained attention students’ academic writing and is an excellent foundation for the next seven semesters at Yale. Required Friday sessions are reserved for writing labs and visits to Yale collections, as well as one-on-one and small-group meetings with the writing instruction staff.\n",
      "NELC 110 Writing Egyptology: Reflecting on Life and Death in Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Bible. Mike Tritsch. Focusing on literature from ancient Egypt, this seminar explores timeless questions of the meaning of life and what happens after we die. Egypt, with its rich traditions to achieve fulfillment in the afterlife, evidenced even today by pyramids, temples, and tombs, provides a rich context before considering the Cuneiform and Hebrew cultures of Mesopotamia and the Mesopotamia. Through the genre of \"pessimistic literature,\" unique to these cultures, the seminar investigates views on life and death, contextualizing them through the historical record. In a world replete with natural disasters, war, violence, disease, and hunger, not to mention the very old existential threat of climate change, pessimistic literature from the ancient Near East ponders questions about the inevitability of human suffering, and whether there is, thereafter, a greater reward.\n",
      "NELC 111 Egypt of the Pharaohs. Joseph Manning, Nadine Moeller. Egypt was among the first centralized territorial states in the world, and, because Egyptian history offers us 4000 years of institutional development and change, the focus of this course is on the long-term development of the ancient Egyptian state, its institutions, and its culture. The course introduces students to the history and culture of ancient Egypt from the rise of the central state to the early Christian period. General historical trends, the relationship of Egyptian history to other contemporary ancient cultures, and the legacy of Egypt to the \"West\" are also considered.

This seminar investigates in detail ancient Egyptian materials, techniques, and industries through the scope of archaeology, history, and socioeconomical, textual as well as iconographic data. When possible ethnoarchaeological and experimental approaches of the antique chaîne-opératoire are discussed in order to illustrate skills and professions that have now completely disappeared. This class is organized according to various themes within a diachronical approach, from the 4th millennium BC to the Roman Period. Copper and precious metals, construction stones, hard stones and gems, glass and faience production, imported wood or ivory, we explore multiple categories of materials, where and how they were collected or exchanged, the way these products were transported, transformed, refined or assembled and the complex organization of the work involved and administration that was required in order to satisfy the tastes of Egyptian elites or their desires to worship their gods. Some other vernacular savoir-faire linked to the everyday life and the death is explored, through food production and mummification practices. The aim of this seminar is not only to give an overview of the history of techniques for this early civilization but, beyond how things were made, to acquire a more critical view of ancient Egyptian culture through the material culture and as well the strong economic and sociologic implications linked to their objects and constructions―rather than the usual focus on its temples and tombs.\n",
      "NELC 324 The Ancient State: Genesis and Crisis from Mesopotamia to Mexico. Harvey Weiss. Ancient states were societies with surplus agricultural production, classes, specialization of labor, political hierarchies, monumental public architecture and, frequently, irrigation, cities, and writing. Pristine state societies, the earliest civilizations, arose independently from simple egalitarian hunting and gathering societies in six areas of the world. How and why these earliest states arose are among the great questions of post-Enlightenment social science. This course explains (1) why this is a problem, to this day, (2) the dynamic environmental forces that drove early state formation, and (3) the unresolved fundamental questions of ancient state genesis and crisis, –law-like regularities or a chance coincidence of heterogenous forces?\n",

      "NELC 680 Post-Classical Islamic Thought. Frank Griffel. Whereas the classical period of Islamic theology and philosophy, with prominent movements such as Mu’tazilism, Ash’arism, falsafa, etc., has attracted the bulk of the attention of intellectual historians who work on Islam, research on the period after that has recently caught up and has become one of the most fertile subfields in Islamic studies. This graduate seminar aims to introduce students into the most recent developments in the study of Islam’s post-classical period, which begins in the twelfth century in response to the conflict between Avicenna (d. 1037) and al-Ghazali (d. 1111). In this seminar we read Arabic texts by philosophical, theological, and scientific authors who were active after 1120, among them Abu l-Barakat al-Baghdadi (d. c. 1165), al-Suhrawardi (d. c. 1192), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1210), Athir al-Din al-Abhari (d. 1265), Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (d. 1311), or Shams al-Din al-Samarqandi (d. 1322). The reading of primary literature happens hand in hand with the discussion of secondary works on those texts. Class sessions are usually divided into a discussion of secondary literature and a reading of Arabic sources.\n",
      "NELC 731 Origins of Ancient Egypt: Archaeology of the Neolithic, Predynastic, and Early Dynastic Periods. Gregory Marouard. This seminar is a graduate-level course that examines, from an archaeological and material culture perspective, the origins of the Egyptian civilization from the late Neolithic period (ca. 5500 BC) to the beginning of the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2900-2800 BC). After a progressive change of the Northeastern Africa climate in the course of the sixth millennium BC, the late Neolithic populations regroup within the Nile valley and rapidly settle in several parts of this natural corridor and major axis of communication between the African continent and the Middle East. Strongly influenced by the Saharan or the Levantine Neolithic, two early Egyptian sedentary communities will arise in Lower and Upper Egypt with very distinctive material cultures and burial practices, marking the gradual development of a complex society from which emerge important societal markers such as social differentiation, craft specialization, long-distance exchange networks, emergence of writing, administration and centralization, that will slowly lead to the development of local elites and early forms of kingship controlling proto-kingdoms. From those societies and the consecutive assimilation of both into a single cultural identity, around 3200 BC, some of the main characteristics of the subsequent Egyptian civilization will emerge from this crucial phase of state formation. Most of the major archaeological sites of this period are investigated through the scope of material culture; art; funerary traditions; and the study of large settlement and cemetery complexes using, as much as possible, information from recent excavations and discoveries. This course includes in particular the study of the first Neolithic settlements (Fayum, Merimde, al-Omari, Badari), the Lower Egyptian cultures (Buto, Maadi, Helwan and the Eastern Delta), the various phases of the Naqada cultures (at Hierakonpolis, Naqada and Ballas, Abydos), and the rise of the state (specifically in Abydos and Memphis areas). This course is suitable for graduate students (M.A. and Ph.D. programs) in the fields of Egyptology, archaeology, anthropology, and ancient history. With instructor and residential college dean approval, undergraduate students with a specialty in Egyptology or archaeology can register. No background in Egyptology is required, and no Egyptian language is taught. This course is the first in a series of chronological survey courses in Egyptian Archaeology.\n",

      "NURS 7680 Clinical Outcome Management in Psychiatric–Mental Health Nursing. Susan Boorin. The provision of mental health services is determined by many factors including policy, public demand, research evidence, ideas among general practitioners and mental health professionals, and the financial pressures under which purchasers and providers of services work. These groups often have widely disparate views about the nature of mental disorders and their most appropriate interventions. In providing services to individuals, families, groups, systems, and organizations, the advanced practice psychiatric nurse functions as clinician, consultant, leader, educator, and researcher in the analysis of critical issues important to decision-making and intervention. The assumption underlying the course is that all advanced practice mental health services should be fundamentally theoretical and evidence-based. In this course students define clinical problems and system implications, use technology to identify clinical and research evidence, and critically analyze the evidence. Based on this analysis they devise and present realistic plans for intervention in the clinical setting and write an evidence-based review paper summarizing the results. Discussion about what constitutes the best available evidence to clarify decision-making with regard to a variety of mental health and health promotion needs is addressed.

By reading handwritten samples, students develop skills that enable them to understand the morphology and functions of these documents, such as emr-i şerîf, berât, hatt-ı hümâyun, telhîs, irâde-i şerîf, mektub, kâ’ime, hulasa, arzuhâl, mahzar, mazbata, hüccet, i’lâm, fetvâ, vakfiye, and tezkires. This helps them pursue independent work in Ottoman studies.\n",
      "OTTM 610 Introduction to Ottoman Turkish I. Ottoman Turkish is the Turkish language written in the Arabic alphabet during the Ottoman Empire (1299–1923), which ruled for almost seven hundred years from North Africa to the Balkans, and the early years of the Turkish Republic established in 1923. Knowledge of Ottoman Turkish thus gives students an important advantage over experts on just one geographical and cultural area of the Muslim world. Students develop skills that will enable them to read Ottoman Turkish texts and pursue independent work in Ottoman studies. We work on building vocabulary, developing competence in Ottoman Turkish, and improving reading skills. Since culture is an integral part of the language, various cultural expressions are introduced through a variety of historical and literary Ottoman texts from the fourteenth to the nineteenth century. We use Korkut Buğday’s The Routledge Introduction to Literary Ottoman for grammar and reading passages. In addition, we read excerpts from Ottoman texts from different genres.\n",

      "PHIL 080 Writing Philosophy: Human Beings and Nature–Topics in Metaphysics, Mind and Action. Paul Forrester. This course serves as an introduction to topics in metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of action. The main question that ties these topics together is: how, if at all, do human beings stand apart from the rest of the natural order? We start by covering debates in metaphysics about the structure and persistence conditions of ordinary objects. We then cover the nature of personal identity. What makes you the same person you were ten years ago? We also study some foundational issues in philosophy of mind, like how, if at all, the mind differs from the body and how they interact with one another. Finally, we discuss the nature of free will and ask whether free choice is possible in a deterministic universe. This is a \"writing in the disciplines\" course, and students have the opportunity to study and engage with some of the best writing in philosophy, and learn how to write like a philosopher themselves.\n",

      "PHIL 118 Buddhist Thought: The Foundations. Eric Greene. This class introduces the fundamentals of Buddhist thought, focusing on the foundational doctrinal, philosophical, and ethical ideas that have animated the Buddhist tradition from its earliest days in India 2500 years ago down to the present, in places such as Tibet, China, and Japan. Though there will be occasional discussion of the social and practical contexts of the Buddhist religion, the primary focus of this course lies on how traditional Buddhist thinkers conceptualize the universe, think about the nature of human beings, and propose that people should live their lives. Our main objects of inquiry are therefore the foundational Buddhist ideas, and the classic texts in which those ideas are put forth and defended, that are broadly speaking shared by all traditions of Buddhism. In the later part of the course, we take up some of these issues in the context of specific, regional forms of Buddhism, and watch some films that provide glimpses of Buddhist religious life on the ground.\n",

We in turn pursue the implications of Aristotle's notion of life by engaging with contemporary philosophical discussions of death that take their point of departure in Epicurus (Nagel, Williams, Scheffler). We conclude by analyzing Heidegger's notion of constitutive mortality, in order to make explicit what is implicit in the form of the soul in Aristotle.\n",

Otherwise put, it concerns the struggles of life with others – the logic, art, and psychology of those struggles. The starting point is a complex of ideas at the center of religions, which are given to differentiating \"us\" from \"them\" while also identifying values such as the love of the neighbor that are to override all differences. But religion is only one avenue into the motif of the neighbor, a fraught term of both proximity and distance, a contested term and practice trailing in its wake lovers, enemies, kin, gods, and strangers. Who is my neighbor? What is this to ask and what does the question ask of us? Course material includes philosophy, literature, psychology, and film.\n",

As both objects of study and agents of discovery, Asian Americans have played an important yet often unseen role in fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in the U.S. Now more than ever, there is a need to rethink and educate students on science’s role in society and its interface with society. This course unites the humanities fields of Asian American history and American Studies with the STEM fields of medicine, physics, and computer science to explore the ways in which scientific practice has been shaped by U.S. histories of imperialism and colonialism, migration and racial exclusion, domestic and international labor and economics, and war. The course also explores the scientific research undertaken in these fields and delves into key scientific principles and concepts to understand the impact of such work on the lives of Asians and Asian Americans, and how the migration of people may have impacted the migration of ideas and scientific progress. Using case students, students engage with fundamental scientific concepts in these fields. They explore key roles Asians and Asian Americans had in the development in science and technology in the United States and around the world as well as the impact of state policies regarding the migration of technical labor and the concerns over brain drains. Students also examine diversity and inclusion in the context of the experiences of Asians and Asian Americans in STEM.\n",

The textbook WKB (or semi-classical) approach to solving quantum eigenvalue problems has been significantly improved and generalized in scope in recent years. New techniques offer advantages, not only over the very circumscribed, classical WKB (Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin) methods (which are mostly limited to elementary, one dimensional quantum mechanical problems), but also over conventional perturbation theory. The corresponding \"Euclidean-Signature Semi-Classical Program\" is undergoing rapid, continuing development and has significant applications, not only to higher dimensional quantum mechanical problems but also to interacting quantum field theories. Unlike conventional perturbation theory this approach does not require the decomposition of a quantum Hamiltonian operator into a solvable (e.g., free field) component and its \"perturbation\" and, in the case of gauge theories, can maintain full, non-abelian gauge invariance at every order of a calculation.\n",

      "PLSC 122 New Challenges for International Cooperation: Automation and Climate Change. Carlos Balcazar. International Political Economy (IPE) scholars largely focus on investigating how countries can achieve and sustain international cooperation. This is of utmost importance because international cooperation generates lower transaction costs, which can increase global well-being, and it creates conditions that tie the hands of political actors to participate in violent conflict. While international cooperation has faced many challenges since World War II, two new challenges have currently become the center-focus for IPE scholars: the domestic and international political consequences of automation and the impending societal consequences of climate change. In the first part of the course, we cover numerous puzzles in the study of the International Political Economy of technological change. In particular, we try to understand its redistributive consequences and the implications that automation has had for sustaining the commitment in Embedded Liberalism. We also inquire about the need for an approach to tackling the political consequences of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) through global governance. In the second part, we address the multiple threats that climate change poses for social and political stability. Most importantly, we explore how can we create domestic coalitions in support of climate policy, and how societies can achieve international cooperation regarding climate change despite its diffuse impacts.\n",

      "PLSC 232 US Federal Education Policy. Eleanor Schiff. Though education policy is typically viewed as a state and local issue, the federal government has taken a significant role in shaping policy since the end of World War II. The centralization of education policy has corresponded with changing views in society for what constitutes an equitable educational opportunity. This class is divided into three topics: 1) the federal role in education broadly (K-12) and the accountability movement in K-12: from the No Child Left Behind Act to the Common Core State Standards (and cross-national comparisons to US schools), 2) federal role in higher education, and 3) the education industry (teachers unions and think tanks).\n",

      "PLSC 239 Political Representation. Amir Fairdosi. The notion of political representation lies at the center of government in the United States and much of the rest of the world. In this course, we examine the features of political representation, both in theory and practice. We ask (and possibly find ourselves struggling to answer!) such questions as: What is political representation? Should we have a representative system as opposed to something else like monarchy or direct democracy? Should representatives demographically resemble those they represent, or is that not necessary? How do things like congressional redistricting, electoral competition, and term limits affect the quality of representation? Do constituents’ preferences actually translate into policy in the United States, and if so, how? In Part I of this course, we discuss the theoretical foundations upon which representative government rests. In Part II, we move beyond theories of representation and on to the way political representation actually operates in the United States. In Part III, we move beyond the ways in which representation works and focus instead on some ways in which it doesn’t work. Proposed solutions are also explored.\n",
      "PLSC 247 The Media and Democracy. Joanne Lipman. In an era of \"fake news,\" when trust in mainstream media is declining, social platforms are enabling the spread of misinformation, and new technologies are transforming the way we consume news, how do journalists hold power to account?

Case studies will span from 19th century yellow journalism to the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter movements, to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and the advent of AI journalism.\n",
      "PLSC 274 Cities: Making Public Choices in New Haven. John DeStefano. Examination of cities, particularly the relationship of people to place and most importantly to one another, through the prism and experiences of the City of New Haven.

How cities, in the context of retreating or antagonistic strategies by the state and  federal governments, can be key platforms for future economic and social wealth creation.\n",
      "PLSC 281 What is the University?. Mordechai Levy-Eichel. The University is one of the most influential—and underexamined—kinds of corporations in the modern world. It is responsible both for mass higher education and for elite training. It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective. Topics include: tenure, endowments, the committee system, the growth of degrees, the aims of research, peer-review, the nature of disciplinary divisions, as well as a host of other issues.\n",

      "PLSC 298 Gender, Justice, Power, Institutions. Joseph Fischel. Welcome to Gender, Justice, Power & Institutions, a mouthful of abstractions that we work together to comprehend and critique throughout the semester. An aspiration of this course, as political as it is pedagogic, is that students approach their world-building projects with an enriched understanding of the ways gender, justice, and power shape and are shaped by institutions, inequality, and theory. Part I opens up some preliminary considerations of our course terms by investigating the case of abortion, abortion rights, and reproductive justice.  The topic is politically loaded, philosophically complex, and emotionally challenging; the point is not to convince you of the permissibility or impermissibility of abortion, but to explore how the contested case configures, imbricates, and puts pressure on our course terms. In Part II, we examine the historical and conceptual coordinates of the courses first three titular terms: is gender a subjective identification, social ascription, or axis of inequality? Is justice a matter of redistribution, recognition, resources, capabilities, or something more hedonic? Where is power located, or where does it circulate? Who are what leverages power? In Part III, we consider ways gender, justice, and power travel within and across several institutions: heterosexuality, the university, the trafficking/anti-trafficking industrial complex, the prison, and the bathroom. Part IV closes out the course by focusing on the reconfiguration of democratic institutions in late modernity; or, can institutions \"love us back\" under the the political economy we shorthand as \"neoliberalism\"?\n",

      "PLSC 302 Rousseau's Emile. Bryan Garsten. A close reading of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s masterpiece, Emile. Though the book poses as a guide to education, it has much grander aspirations; it offers a whole vision of the human condition. Rousseau called it his \"best and worthiest work\" and said he believed it would spark a revolution in the way that human beings understand themselves. Many historians of thought believe that the book has done just that, and that we live in the world it helped to create – a claim we consider and evaluate. Presented as a private tutor’s account of how he would arrange the education of a boy named Emile from infancy through young adulthood, the book raises fundamental questions about human nature and malleability, how we learn to be free, whether we can view ourselves scientifically and still maintain a belief in free will, whether we are need of some sort of religious faith to act morally, how adults and children, and men and women, ought to relate to one another, how the demands of social life and citizenship affect our happiness – and more. Ultimately the question at issue is whether human beings can find a way to live happily and flourish in modern societies.\n",
      "PLSC 306 Tragedy and Politics. Daniel Schillinger. The canonical Greek tragedians—Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides—dramatize fundamental and discomfiting questions that are often sidelined by the philosophical tradition. In this seminar, we read plays about death, war, revenge, madness, impossible choices, calamitous errors, and the destruction of whole peoples. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were also piercing observers of political life. No less than Plato and Aristotle, the Attic tragedians write to elicit reflection on the basic patterns of politics: democracy and tyranny, war and peace, the family and the city, the rule of law and violence. Finally, we also approach Greek tragedy through its reception. Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Nietzsche: all these thinkers responded to tragedy. Texts include Aeschylus, Oresteia; Aristophanes, Frogs and Lysistrata; Euripides, Bacchae, Heracles, and Trojan Women; Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy; Plato, Symposium; and Sophocles, Antigone, Philoctetes, and Oedipus Tyrannus.\n",
      "PLSC 312 Punishment. Alexander Rosas. This course is about punishment. The power of the state to restrict freedom, to impose pain, even death, and to mark one as 'criminal' is remarkable, and this course interrogates the theories that underlie that power. In what cases and for what reasons should the state have the power to punish, and where should the moral and legal limits on that power lie? What should the goals of punishment be, and which forms of punishment align most closely with them? What is the nature and desired role of vengeance and mercy in determining whether, when, and how to punish? What obligations should a society have to punish but also to those whom it punishes? Should the state have the power to shame and humiliate? What does punishment reveal about society more broadly? This course considers these and other related questions primarily through works in political and legal theory, but it also takes an interdisciplinary approach and elaborates and evaluates the theoretical materials through a discussion of numerous legal and other case studies.\n",

      "PLSC 339 Political Theory, The Internet and New Techonologies. Luise Papcke. How do new technologies impact our politics and change our society? How can we assess in which way emerging technologies such as predictive algorithms, automated decision-making, biomedical human enhancements, or workplace automation enhance our freedom, equality, and democracy, or threaten them? This course turns to central ideas in political theory to examine the promises and challenges of these new technologies. Each unit begins with an analysis of core political texts about foundational ideas in liberal democracy. Students study key philosophical debates from the 19th to the 21st century about freedom, equality, and self-rule that have formed Western societies. Next, the course focuses for each theme on a unique emerging technology via magazine articles and news reports. Using concepts from political theory, students analyze how the respective emerging technologies support or challenge our political and social ideas, as well as our current philosophical preconceptions and assumptions.\n",
      "PLSC 347 YData: Data Science for Political Campaigns. Joshua Kalla. Political campaigns have become increasingly data driven. Data science is used to inform where campaigns compete, which messages they use, how they deliver them, and among which voters. In this course, we explore how data science is being used to design winning campaigns. Students gain an understanding of what data is available to campaigns, how campaigns use this data to identify supporters, and the use of experiments in campaigns. This course provides students with an introduction to political campaigns, an introduction to data science tools necessary for studying politics, and opportunities to practice the data science skills presented in S&DS 123, YData.\n",

The task of measurement is common to qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method research, and this course draws on lessons from varied approaches. Course readings span: 1. \"classic\" theoretical texts dealing with broad concepts of interest to political scientists; 2. empirical work that develops/applies novel strategies to measure foundational concepts; 3. work that combines conceptualization (developing new concepts and/or reimagining old ones) and measurement. This course is intended for advanced undergraduate students with an interest in social science research and graduate students in the process of designing original research.\n",

      "PLSC 387 Capitalism and Crisis. Isabela Mares. This course provides an introduction to the study of comparative capitalism. We examine how institutions organizing labor markets, finance and the welfare state differ systematically across advanced industrialized countries and the consequence of these differences for a variety of economic and policy outcomes. These include economic growth, unemployment, levels of inequality and so on. Can we meaningfully talk about a German or Swedish model and if so, what are the main institutional arrangements that differ across these economies? How do institutions in these countries differ from more liberal capitalist economies, such as the United States? In the second part of the course, we examine the responses of different countries to a variety of economic shocks. These include the stagflation crisis of the 1970’s, the slowdown in economic growth, deindustrialization, the rise in unemployment and inequality and the migration crisis. We examine how existing political and economic institutions have shaped the policy trade-offs encountered by different countries and we explain the different political responses taken in response to these crises. During the period between November 14 and November 24, enrollment will be limited to majors. After November 24, registration will be opened to all Yale College students.

      "PLSC 429 Pandemics in Africa: From the Spanish Influenza to Covid-19. Jonny Steinberg. The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.\n",

      "PLSC 445 The Politics of Fascism. Lauren Young. The subject of this course is fascism: its rise in Europe in the 1930s and deployment during the Second World War as a road map to understanding the resurgence of nationalism and populism in today’s political landscape, both in Europe and the United States. The course begins with an examination of the historic debates around fascism, nationalism, populism, and democracy. It then moves geographically through the 1930s and 1940s in Europe, looking specifically at Weimar Germany, Vichy France, the rise of fascism in England in the 1930s, and how fascist ideology was reflected in Italy’s colonial ambitions during the Abyssinian War. The course examines fascism and the implementation of racial theory and the example of anti-Semitism as an ideological and political tool. It also looks at the emergence of fascism in visual culture. The second part of the seminar turns to fascist ideology and the realities of today’s political world.  We examine the political considerations of building a democratic state, question the compromise between security and the preservation of civil liberties and look at the resurgence of populism and nationalism in Europe and the US. The course concludes by examining the role of globalization in contemporary political discourse.\n",

This seminar explores the history of right-wing political thought from the late eighteenth century to the present, with an emphasis on the role played by religious and pagan traditions. This course seeks to answer the question, what constitutes the right? What are the central philosophical, religious, and pagan, principles of those groups associated with this designation? How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies. While the course is limited to the modern period, it adopts a global perspective to better understand the full scope of right-wing politics.\n",

      "PLSC 527 From Concept to Measure: Empirical Inquiry in Social Science. Sarah Khan. This course focuses on a specific aspect of the research design process: the operationalization of abstract into concrete measures that can be used for analysis and inference. The task of operationalization is common to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method research, and this course draws on lessons from varied approaches. Readings are divided equally between (1) foundational theoretical texts dealing with broad concepts of interest to social scientists with an interest in politics (including but not limited to identity, norms, preferences, responsiveness, and accountability) and (2) recent approaches to measuring these concepts in the fields of political science, psychology, sociology, and economics. Key assignments include a paper critiquing the measurement strategy and developing an alternative measure in response to an existing study, and an original research proposal.

      "PLSC 578 What is the University?. Mordechai Levy-Eichel. The University is one of the most influential—and underexamined—kinds of corporations in the modern world. It is responsible both for mass higher education and for elite training. It aims to produce and disseminate knowledge, and to prepare graduates for work in all different kinds of fields. It functions both as a symbol and repository of learning, if not ideally wisdom, and functions as one of the most important sites of networking, patronage, and socialization today. It is, in short, one of the most alluring and abused institutions in our culture today, often idolized as a savior or a scapegoat. And while the first universities were not founded in the service of research, today’s most prestigious schools claim to be centrally dedicated to it. But what is research? Where does our notion of research and the supposed ability to routinely produce it come from? This seminar is a high-level historical and structural examination of the rise of the research university. We cover both the origins and the modern practices of the university, from the late medieval world to the modern day, with an eye toward critically examining the development of the customs, practices, culture, and work around us, and with a strong comparative perspective. Topics include: tenure, endowments, the committee system, the growth of degrees, the aims of research, peer-review, the nature of disciplinary divisions, as well as a host of other issues.\n",
      "PLSC 579 Rousseau's Emile. Bryan Garsten. A close reading of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s masterpiece, Emile. Though the book poses as a guide to education, it has much grander aspirations; it offers a whole vision of the human condition. Rousseau called it his \"best and worthiest work\" and said he believed it would spark a revolution in the way that human beings understand themselves. Many historians of thought believe that the book has done just that, and that we live in the world it helped to create—a claim we consider and evaluate. Presented as a private tutor’s account of how he would arrange the education of a boy named Emile from infancy through young adulthood, the book raises fundamental questions about human nature and malleability; how we learn to be free; whether we can view ourselves scientifically and still maintain a belief in free will; whether we are in need of some sort of religious faith to act morally; how adults and children, and men and women, ought to relate to one another; how the demands of social life and citizenship affect our happiness—and more. Ultimately the question at issue is whether human beings can find a way to live happily and flourish in modern societies.\n",
      "PLSC 601 Theories of Freedom: Schelling and Hegel. Paul North. In 1764 Immanuel Kant noted in the margin of one of his published books that evil was \"the subjection of one being under the will of another,\" a sign that good was coming to mean freedom. But what is freedom? Starting with early reference to Kant, we study two major texts on freedom in post-Kantian German Idealism, Schelling's 1809 Philosophical Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom and Related Objects and Hegel's 1820 Elements of the Philosophy of Right.\n",

      "PLSC 677 New Challenges for International Cooperation: Automation and Climate Change. Carlos Balcazar. International Political Economy (IPE) scholars largely focus on invesgating how can countries achieve and sustain international cooperation. This is of utmost importance because international cooperation generates  lower transaction costs, which can increase global well-being, and because it creates conditions that tie the hands of political actors to participate in violent conflict. While international cooperation has faced many challenges since World War II, two new challenges have currently become center-focus for IPE scholars: the domestic and international political consequences of automation and the impending societal consequences of climate change. This course tackles these two relevant issues in world politics. Overall, the course takes a hands-on approach: We closely interrogate the arguments and evidence presented in the readings, prioritizing depth of analysis over quantity of articles covered. Then, on the basis of this these inputs, our goal is to propose and test (new) theories that help us understand the implications that automation and climate change pose for world politics. The course has two parts: In the first part, we cover numerous puzzles in the study of the International Political Economy of technological change. In particular, we try to understand its redistributive consequences and the implications that automation has had for sustaining the commitment in Embedded Liberalism. We also inquire about the need for an approach of tackling the political consequences of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) through global governance. In the second part, we address the multiple threats that climate change poses for social and political stability. Most importantly, we explore how can we create domestic coalitions in support of climate policy and how societies can achieve international cooperation regarding climate change despite its diffuse impacts.\n",

If our system of checks and balances manages to survive, is there a need for fundamental reform? Or will only modest adjustments suffice? In either case, which reforms deserve the highest priority? In this course we consider prospects for future reform in the light of the efforts made by previous generations of Americans—from the Founding through the Reagan Revolution—to confront the constitutional crises of their own times, and how their successes and failures shaped today’s predicaments.

While our nation's youth are increasingly more anxious and disconnected than ever before, social and emotional learning, or SEL, is being politicized by arguments without empirical evidence. The reality is that due in part to its interdisciplinary origins, and in part to its quick uptake, what SEL is, why it matters, and who it benefits, has garnered significant attention since its inception. Key questions and discourse over the past three decades include if SEL skills are: another name for personality, soft skills, 21st century skills, or emotional intelligence, are SEL skills stand-alone or do they need to be taught together and in sequence, for how long does the intervention need to last to be effective, how do you assess SEL, are SEL skills culturally responsive and universally applicable, and can SEL promote the conditions for education equity? In this seminar, students unpack these key questions and challenge and evolve the current discourse through seminal and contemporary readings, writing, and artifact analyses. Students are provided with the opportunity to engage critically with the largest data set amassed to date of the contemporary evidence for SEL.\n",

Many of those who are paying attention find themselves feeling overwhelmed, powerless, and hopeless in the face of increasing natural disasters, rapidly disappearing species, and compounding environmental injustices. This class begins from these challenges. It asks: Can we sustain hope in a just and sustainable ecological future? Should we sustain such a hope? If so, what would such a future look like? Can we imagine a future beyond fossils fuels, beyond exploitative and extractivist relations among humans and between humans and the more-than-human world? Can we imagine a decolonial future, a future of multispecies justice? How do these hopes and visions interact with ultimate religious hopes? How should these hopes and visions shape our actions and emotions in this moment?

      "REL 712 History of Early Christianity: Origins and Growth. Teresa Morgan. This course introduces students to early Christianity from the first to the eighth century. This is an introductory course that does not assume any prior knowledge of the topic. We examine the social, political, religious, and cultural contexts in which early Christianity (or Christianities) emerged, and how \"the faith\" grew, was shaped by, and helped shape the world around it. We explore practices of corporate worship and devotion; the development of doctrine and the idea of orthodoxy; the evolution of Church institutions; the formation of Christian scriptures; the impact of persecution and imperial patronage; the development of Christian material culture, art and architecture; and what it meant for people in different roles and situations to live as \"the faithful\" in everyday life. In dialogue with influential theologians of the period, we explore how Christian identities are formed and articulated and the role of power, conflict, and resistance in that process. Students encounter a wide range of primary sources, secondary literature, and historical methods and approaches, giving them the opportunity to sharpen their critical and historiographical skills. In many ways, this is the most formative and influential period of Christian history, and getting to grips with its broad outlines and key themes is both fascinating in itself and gives students vital contextual knowledge for understanding later developments in Christian history and thought. This course serves as essential preparation for the study of Christian history and theology in later historical periods. Above all, it provides an opportunity to consider early Christianity on its own terms and to discover how it continues to shape the lives of Christians today. Area III.\n",

This course introduces students to the rapidly changing world of early modern Christianity, a period that ranges from the Reformation to the Enlightenment and the transatlantic worlds of the eighteenth century. This age saw the dramatic expansion of Christianity beyond Europe to Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and the course explores the global nature of the early modern world. Themes such as colonization, slavery, and the diversities of religious experience are examined. Students are exposed to a range of primary sources and historical methods to examine rival interpretations and perspectives. The course focuses on the reading of a wide variety of primary sources from the period. Above all, it challenges students to consider the past both on its own terms and how it continues to shape our present. Area III.\n",

      "REL 719 Christianity and Coloniality in Contemporary Africa. Kyama Mugambi. Missionary complicity with the colonial enterprise puts Christianity at the heart of the problematic relationship between the African continent and the West. At the same time, Christianity has continued to grow rapidly in post-independence Africa. In much of Africa south of the Sahara, decolonization efforts coincided with the period of the greatest Christian expansion in history. Africa is now the continent with the highest population of Christians. This course examines this conundrum through critical engagement with theory, literature, and data from the continent. Students explore historiographic, political, social, economic, and demographic dimensions of this discussion. They meet key theories posited with regard to African Christianity in the wake of a colonial history. The course surveys contemporary issues in the discourse within the urban, educational, social, and cultural spheres. Students also consider gender perspectives on coloniality as it pertains to religion and politics. The course assesses the role of indigenous agency in the development of Christianity within contemporary Africa. Through this course students gain a more nuanced perspective as they examine and problematize critical arguments in the prevailing discourse on Christianity and coloniality in Africa today.

This course draws on theoretical perspectives from anthropology, American studies, religious studies, and postcolonial studies to interrogate the varied intersections between religion and U.S. empire. It asks not only how Christianity and other religious traditions have facilitated imperialism and how they have served as resources for resistance, but also how the categories of \"religion\" and the \"secular\" have been assembled as imperial products alongside modern formations of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Through response papers, seminar discussions, and (for graduate students) a final historiographical paper, students develop the analytical and writing skills that are the building blocks of all scholarship in the humanities.

Moving from the early colonial period to the present, and with particular attention to Native American voices, we explore a variety of indigenous responses to Catholic and Protestant missions and the development of distinctively Native Christian traditions. Along the way, the course interrogates and historicizes key trends in the study of indigenous Christianity, including Red-Power era critiques of missions, the influence of postcolonial theory, and the recent emphasis on indigenous Christian agency.

This lecture course explores the art, architecture, and material culture of the Byzantine Empire from the foundation of its capital, Constantinople, in the fourth century to the fifteenth century. Centered around the Eastern Mediterranean, Byzantium was a dominant political power in Europe for several centuries and fostered a highly sophisticated artistic culture. This course aims to familiarize students with key objects and monuments from various media—mosaic, frescoes, wooden panels, metalwork, ivory carvings—and from a variety of contexts—public and private, lay and monastic, imperial and political. We give special attention to issues of patronage, propaganda, reception, and theological milieux, as well as the interaction of architecture and ritual.

This course explores early Christian ethical thinking, to around the end of the second century, in its social and cultural contexts. In the process we encounter the differences among approaches to ethics in history, anthropology, philosophy, and theology and consider how they influence the way ethics are interpreted. We discuss some of the most important passages of the Hebrew Bible that frame later Jewish and Christian ethical thinking, and we consider how later Jewish writing relates especially to the Mosaic Law. We explore some classics of Greek and Roman philosophical ethics and popular morality and how they influenced Christian thought. Against these backgrounds we read some of the key passages of ethical teaching in the New Testament together with a cross-section of non-testamental second-century writers. At every point, we are interested both in where Christianity is in continuity with the ethical discourses that helped to shape it and where it is distinctive. We discuss what ethical topics these writers talk about, and what they do not, and why. Where God is the ultimate moral authority, what aspects of God are invoked in ethical contexts? Where God is the ultimate authority, are ethics always deontological, or are there other reasons for doing the right thing? What is the relationship between divine command and human freedom? Where does evil come from? Can human beings argue effectively with God, or protest against God’s commands, or improve on them? What evaluative language do these texts employ—good and bad, good and evil, useful, necessary, beautiful, sweet—and what difference does it make? Why do ethical texts so often take the form of miscellanies? How do ethical writings contribute to our understanding of early Christian thinking about God, Christ, and the Church? What are the challenges as we draw on early Christian tradition to help us think ethically today? Area II and Area III.\n",

The rapid, previously  unexpected growth of Christianity in Africa in the twentieth century calls for deeper scholarly reflection. Keen students of global trends are aware that Africa is now home to more Christians than Europe or North America. While the rapid growth can be traced to a century of vigorous activity, Christianity has a long eventful history on the continent. This course provides a broad overview of Christianity in Africa over two millennia. The early part of the course focuses on the beginnings and development of the Church in Africa. The material highlights the role of African Christian thinkers in shaping early Christian discourses in increasingly dynamic global and continental contexts. The course weaves critical themes emerging in African Christianity north of the expansive Sahara desert, and then south of it. Students encounter critical issues in missionary Christianity in Africa and gain a historical understanding of the milestones in Christian growth that contribute to Christianity’s status as both an African and global religion.

In this course, we carefully interrogate the historical connections between religion (primarily Christianity), education, and struggles for freedom within African American communities and what I have come to describe as radical black religious education during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Students explore the ways that scholars have theorized about the radical or progressive dimensions of African American religion, as well as the different definitions and visions of social flourishing at various points throughout the twentieth century. At times, we challenge what has been included in the religious educational tradition of African Americans and what is considered radical. In part, this includes reframing dominant understandings of the contributions of great educators and intellectuals, underscoring the tension between valuing the work of black male intellectuals while recognizing the ongoing silencing and obscuring of black women’s social and intellectual work. The course begins with an emphasis on early black religious educators and missionaries, such as Daniel Alexander Payne and Amanda Smith, whose work in the nineteenth century set the stage for the evolution of radical religious education in the twentieth. It continues by focusing on the work of scholars such as Anna Julia Cooper, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Nannie Helen Burroughs, and Carter G. Woodson, as well as the mid-twentieth-century religiously inspired social activism and the education that undergirded much of the civil rights movement. The course concludes by investigating the corresponding changes in black churches and religious academies that resulted from articulations of black power and black freedom and by acknowledging the ongoing significance of questions regarding the interconnection of race, religion, and radical education in contemporary social change movements.

Drawing on a historical framework for the role of chaplaincy in the college setting from the middle of the twentieth century (when secularism became a heavier influence), and exploring the issues that enhance the vocation in a pluralistic context of the twenty-first century, the course provides an overview of strategies needed to offer a creative, current, and engaging chaplaincy in higher education. Through a series of lectures, open discussions, site visits, short chaplaincy narratives, guest speakers, and hands-on creative projects involving extensive group work, the class encounters numerous perspectives and approaches. The course is dedicated to the examination of individual points of view from college and university chaplains from various faith traditions and in different settings (i.e., small liberal arts schools, historically Black colleges, large research institutions, church-based schools) from across the country. These viewpoints also provide seeds for a deeper discussion of issues such as race, class, gender, and sexual orientation within college and university chaplaincies. Area IV and Area V.\n",

Elements of Ephesians influential for Christian belief and praxis include the assertion that by grace believers have been saved through faith (2:8), the avowal that Christ is our peace (2:14), the articulation of a theology of unity expressed through vocation and baptism (4:4–6), the notion that God has equipped the saints with diverse gifts for ministry (4:11–13), the exhortation to walk in love as Christ loved us (5:2), and the trope of spiritual armor with which believers may contend against spiritual forces of evil (6:10–17). This course invites students to explore Ephesians as a vitally important resource for Christian proclamation. Students engage contemporary homiletical theory, study sermons from expert preachers, and develop their own homiletical capacity by preaching on texts from Ephesians. Throughout the course, students consider how to make the Gospel known through preaching practices that honor the sophisticated theology and rhetoric of Ephesians. Area IV.\n",

What ought to be our social responsibilities, particularly to those who are most vulnerable and in need of support, is a contested issue. The COVID-19 pandemic intensively and sharply reveals the public health crisis before us as well as some of the social and systemic inequities that structure our society and how those inequities impact the lives of people. This course has as its focus the effort to theologically reflect on, and discern from, an interdisciplinary approach to defining \"the disinherited.\" Students explore aspects of the Christian dimensions of social and political reform movements; the contours of faith-based social services; the influence of religious values on individual behavior; and ideas about the role of the church and government in meeting human needs. Through the interests and research of students, the course addresses topics such as poverty; health care disparities; sexual orientation; ethnic, gender, and racial discrimination; hunger; immigration; homelessness; public education; and the welfare of children. Students are expected to develop an interdisciplinary approach from perspectives found in biblical scriptures, sacred texts, theological/religious beliefs and values, social work, sociology of religion, law, psychology of religion, political science, and social welfare theories. In that setting, students contextualize a theological understanding of the disinherited and what might constitute a ministry that addresses the needs of these groups.

This course explores preaching strategies for introverts. Finding ways to make the depth of one's spiritual insights accessible to others is the central task. Students examine strategies for engaging scripture, composing sermons, and relating with listeners. Since conceptions of introversion are largely undergirded by the preacher’s identity and relationship to broader cultural contexts, this course gives considerable attention to the ways race and gender inform introversion and include strategies for integrating embodied knowledge and cultural identity.

The course then considers the similarities and differences between ministry in church settings and in school settings, both secular schools and schools with some sort of religious affiliation. Our principal text is \"What Schools Teach Us About Religious Life.\" In our study of schools, students consider the issues of school mission, culture, and leadership, including the relationship between church-based schools and the host church/denomination.

First, we consider why, indeed, the whole world doesn’t love chamber music and interrogate the ways in which various ontological and epistemic claims are forwarded in the planning, experience, and interpretation of sonic-religious practice. Thereafter, by addressing case studies that span both northern and southern hemispheres, the course engages key themes in the ethnomusicological and anthropological study of music and religion. Through topics such as music and postcolonialism, modernity, gender and sexuality, history, ritual, postsecularism, communication and technology, labor, and diaspora, discussions center the role of power in shaping the conditions under which truth is experienced on two interconnected levels: in \"the field,\" where events themselves happen and \"at home,\" where events are interpreted and rendered into academic prose.

In particular, the course engages with Islam as a living tradition—a vibrant faith that is constantly and dynamically being developed, challenged, practiced, and lived. Three core themes run through the course: tradition, practice, and encounter. The course is especially designed to provide M.Div. and M.A.R. students with the language, vocabulary, terminology, foundational knowledge, and perspectives to begin—or further—their study and engagement with Islamic theology, texts, and ideas in particular, and with Muslim life in general.

How can we use frameworks from linguistics and language study to understand and further appreciate the nature, functions, and power of religious language in our own lives and in society in general? These are some of the questions that we explore in this course. Focusing on Christian traditions and the English language, we look at aspects of word choice, metaphor, and other language strategies of religious language, and we use online tools, text collections, and search software to see what makes religious language tick. We draw on genre analysis to see how prayers and sermons as well as eulogies and other genres are put together linguistically (both now and historically) and discuss how knowledge of \"genre language\" can inform our understanding of the parameters of certain genres as well as their creative flexibility. As we look at the details of language and language strategies, we also consider what role religious language plays in creating and maintaining communities (drawing especially on the concept of \"communities of practice\") and how the community function of religious language is exploited by individuals as well as groups for commercial and political reasons. The smaller assignments in the class allow students to explore aspects of religious language that are important to them, and the final project, which can take a number of different shapes, can be adapted to students' particular commitments, whether religious/congregational, non-profit, educational, creative, linguistic, or other.

      "REL 936 Religion and Race in the United States. Todne Thomas. Religion, race, and ethnicity mediate contested social memberships. Religious imaginaries often possess power through their association with eternal and transcendent truths. Racial and ethnic identities have existed as powerful social taxonomies because they are believed to be fixed, innate, and biologically determined. Thus, religious and racial phenomena are popularly imagined as somehow existing beyond the realm of the social. When set in the context of the United States—a society that is self-referentially multicultural but that is informed by hegemonic white Anglo-Saxon Protestant cultural norms—the critical, deconstructive study of religion and race emerges as a complex and significant intellectual project. This class examines how religion and race intersect in the United States from the eighteenth century until the present. Through our analysis of religious studies texts that straddle a number of disciplines, we explore how religion and race mutually inform shared understandings of socio-political belonging, hierarchy and boundaries, recuperative institutional projects, and structural and personal identities. In this rendition of the course we examine the intersections of religion, race, and settler colonialism; the operation of minoritized religious movements in contexts of detention and government surveillance; and scenes of interracial religious solidarities and conflicts. In this course students acquire working conceptual definitions of religion and race/ethnicity, develop an understanding of how religion and race mediate interlocking modes of structural oppression and collective identities through comparative analysis, and apply theories of religion and race/ethnicity to case studies to demonstrate comprehension and distill independent thinking.

      "REL 955 The Cult of Saints in Early Christianity and the Middle Ages. Felicity Harley, Vasileios Marinis. For all its reputed (and professed) disdain of the corporeal and earthly, Christianity lavished considerable attention and wealth on the material dimension of sainthood and the \"holy\" during its formative periods in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Already in the second century Christian communities accorded special status to a select few \"friends of God,\" primarily martyrs put to death during Roman persecutions. Subsequently the public and private veneration of saints and their earthly remains proliferated, intensified, and became an intrinsic aspect of Christian spirituality and life in both East and West until the Reformation. To do so, it had to gradually develop a theology to accommodate everything from fingers of saints to controversial and miracle-working images. This course investigates the theology, origins, and development of the cult of saints in early Christianity and the Middle Ages with special attention to its material manifestations. The class combines the examination of thematic issues, such as pilgrimage and the use and function of reliquaries (both portable and architectural), with a focus on such specific cases as the evolution of the cult of the Virgin Mary.

The course begins with three essays—mourning essays by Freud (1917), Klein (1940), and Fanon (1952)—to which subsequent texts respond in a variety of ways. The course then moves through key texts from the late 1980s to the present. The aim of this course is to familiarize students with key texts in Black feminist, queer, and trans theory, while cultivating appreciation for how texts considered theory are as much singular sites of experience as they are enabling of critical abstraction. The course asks not only how mourning and theorizing (in)form each other, but also how mourning theory orients studies of race, religion, gender, and sexuality and vice versa.

This seminar introduces students to contemporary public policy debates about poverty, ecological devastation, and voting rights by examining the moral issues at stake in each debate from a theological and constitutional perspective. With the best data and evidence-based research available, students are challenged to ask not only what is possible, but also what justice, love, and mercy demand of society and how this moral mandate can be leveraged to effect positive policy change. We are joined by guests from the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy’s Fellows Program who are both experts in their fields and directly-impacted activists working for policy change on the issues we discuss.

      "RLST 127 Buddhist Thought: The Foundations. Eric Greene. This class introduces the fundamentals of Buddhist thought, focusing on the foundational doctrinal, philosophical, and ethical ideas that have animated the Buddhist tradition from its earliest days in India 2500 years ago down to the present, in places such as Tibet, China, and Japan. Though there will be occasional discussion of the social and practical contexts of the Buddhist religion, the primary focus of this course lies on how traditional Buddhist thinkers conceptualize the universe, think about the nature of human beings, and propose that people should live their lives. Our main objects of inquiry are therefore the foundational Buddhist ideas, and the classic texts in which those ideas are put forth and defended, that are broadly speaking shared by all traditions of Buddhism. In the later part of the course, we take up some of these issues in the context of specific, regional forms of Buddhism, and watch some films that provide glimpses of Buddhist religious life on the ground.\n",

      "RLST 162 Tradition and Modernity: Ethics, Religion, Politics, Law, & Culture. Andrew Forsyth. This seminar is about \"tradition\"—what it is and what it does—and how reflecting on tradition can help us better understand ethics, religion, politics, law, and culture. We ask: for whom and in what ways (if any) are the beliefs and practices transmitted from one generation to another persuasive or even authoritative? And how do appeals to tradition work today? We traverse a series of cases studies in different domains. Looking to ethics, we ask if rational argument means rejecting or inhabiting tradition. Next, we look at religions as traditions and traditions as one source of authority within religions. We consider appeals to tradition in conservative and progressive politics. And how the law uses decisions on past events to guide present actions. Finally, we turn to tradition in civic and popular culture with attention to \"invented traditions,\" the May 2023 British Coronation, and Beyoncé’s 2019 concert film \"Homecoming.\"\n",

      "RLST 175 North Korea and Religion. Hwansoo Kim. Ever since the establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1948 and the Korean War (1950–1953), North Korea has been depicted by the media as a reclusive, oppressive, and military country, its leaders as the worst dictators, and its people as brainwashed, tortured, and starving to death. The still ongoing Cold War discourse, intensified by the North Korea’s recent secret nuclear weapons program, furthers these negative images, and outsiders have passively internalized these images. However, these simplistic characterizations prevent one from gaining a balanced understanding of and insight into North Korea and its people on the ground. Topics other than political, military, and security issues are rarely given attention. On the whole, even though North Korea’s land area is larger than South Korea and its population of 25 million accounts for a third of all Koreans, North Korea has been neglected in the scholarly discussion of Korean culture. This class tries to make sense of North Korea in a more comprehensive way by integrating the political and economic with social, cultural, and religious dimensions. In order to accomplish this objective, students examine leadership, religious (especially cultic) aspects of the North Korean Juche ideology, the daily lives of its citizens, religious traditions, the Korean War, nuclear development and missiles, North Korean defectors and refugees, human rights, Christian missionary organizations, and unification, among others. Throughout, the course places North Korean issues in the East Asian and global context. The course draws upon recent scholarly books, articles, journals, interviews with North Korean defectors, travelogues, media publications, and visual materials.\n",

      "RLST 246 Beyond the Typology: Christian-Buddhist Engagement in Southeast Asia. David Moe. Southeast Asia is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse regions in the world, yet this region and its religions do not receive sufficient attention. This region is home to three world religions—majority Christianity is mainly found in the Philippines and East Timor; Theravada Buddhism in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia; Mahayana Buddhism in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore,; and Islam in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. This course pays particular attention to Christian-Buddhist engagement from the colonial past to the post-colonial present. We consider questions such as, \"How did Western missionaries make contact with Buddhists in a colonial period?\", What is the result of the colonial legacy of foreign missionaries?\" and \"How do local Christians and Buddhists understand their ethnic identity and religious otherness in a post-colonial period?\" Using thematic and comparative approaches, this course will introduce students to Christian-Buddhist origins, movements, teachings, practices, social and spiritual involvements. We fill in some gaps by balancing the nuanced approaches to religious doctrines and lived experiences. We also examine the problem of a misleading typology—exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism—and discern how the interreligious ethics of compassion should serve as a fresh way for a Christian-Buddhist’s hospitable engagement and for building a multicultural nation in contemporary Southeast Asia.\n",

      "RLST 258 Black Church Burning. Todne Thomas. Black churches are vital institutions that have contributed to the spiritual and physical survival of African-descended communities in North America. Nonetheless, the very centrality of black churches to black survival, refuge, development, and flourishing has made them targets for white supremacist and other modalities of violence. This course compels us to turn our attention to the troubling archive of anti-black religious violence manifested in black church bombings, burnings, and shootings in the United States from the antebellum period to the present. More than a survey of the ravages of anti-black religious violence, this course also challenges us to consider the spiritual, experiential, and prophetic significance of fire within the Black Christian tradition. Black Church Burning, then, references the spiritual, symbolic, and material destruction of fire and how it is wielded by black Christian practitioners in relation to regenerative rebukes and potentialities. Course participants survey foundational texts about the significance of African American churches. They also contemplate the offerings and shortcomings of historical, social scientific, theological, and artistic depictions of black church arson and black Christian pneumatic concepts, as well as their moral and material implications.\n",

This seminar explores the history of right-wing political thought from the late eighteenth century to the present, with an emphasis on the role played by religious and pagan traditions. This course seeks to answer the question, what constitutes the right? What are the central philosophical, religious, and pagan, principles of those groups associated with this designation? How have the core ideas of the right changed over time? We do this by examining primary tracts written by theologians, political philosophers, and social theorists as well as secondary literature written by scholars interrogating movements associated with the right in America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies. While the course is limited to the modern period, it adopts a global perspective to better understand the full scope of right-wing politics.\n",
      "RLST 347 Sexual Minorities from Plato to the Enlightenment. Igor De Souza. This interdisciplinary course surveys the history of homosexuality from a cross-cultural, comparative  perspective. Students study contexts where homosexuality and sodomy were categorized, regulated, and persecuted and examine ancient and medieval constructions of same-sex desire in light of post-modern developments, challenging ideas around what is considered normal and/or natural. Ultimately, we ask: what has changed, and what has remained the same, in the history of homosexuality? What do gays and lesbians today have in common with pre-modern sodomites? Can this history help us ground or rethink our sexual selves and identities? Primary and secondary historical sources, some legal and religious sources, and texts in intellectual history are studied. Among the case studies for the course are ancient attitudes among Jews, early Christians, and Greeks; Christian theologians of the Middle Ages; Renaissance Florence; the Inquisition in Iberia; colonial Latin America; and the Enlightenment’s condemnation of sodomy by Montesquieu and Voltaire, and its defense by Bentham.\n",

      "RLST 428 Neighbors and Others. Nancy Levene. This course is an interdisciplinary investigation of concepts and stories of family, community, borders, ethics, love, and antagonism. Otherwise put, it concerns the struggles of life with others – the logic, art, and psychology of those struggles. The starting point is a complex of ideas at the center of religions, which are given to differentiating \"us\" from \"them\" while also identifying values such as the love of the neighbor that are to override all differences. But religion is only one avenue into the motif of the neighbor, a fraught term of both proximity and distance, a contested term and practice trailing in its wake lovers, enemies, kin, gods, and strangers. Who is my neighbor? What is this to ask and what does the question ask of us? Course material includes philosophy, literature, psychology, and film.\n",

What do we mean when we say something is \"real\" or \"realistic?\" From what is it being differentiated−the imaginary, the surreal, the speculative? Can we approach a meaningful concept of the unreal? This course wagers that representational norms do not simply reflect existing notions of reality; they also shape our idea of reality itself. We study the dynamics of realism and its counterparts across a range of examples from modern art, literature, philosophy, and religion. Readings may include: Aimé Cesaire, Mircea Eliade, Karen Barad, Gustave Flaubert, Sigmund Freud, Renee Gladman, Saidiya Hartman, Arthur Schopenhauer. Our goal is to understand how practices of representation reveal something about our understanding of reality, shedding light on the ways we use this most basic, yet most elusive concept.\n",

This seminar introduces the literary sources relevant for the earliest era of Chinese Buddhism, during the (Eastern) Han and Three Kingdoms period, which primarily consist of early translations of Indian Buddhist literature and a few pioneering Chinese commentaries to them. Largely unstudied by modern scholars owing to their archaic language and vocabulary, these sources document the first recorded intellectual encounters between the Indian and East Asian worlds. Together with a careful reading of a selection of the relevant primary sources, we also take up secondary readings on the history of early Chinese Buddhism and broader works on the problematics of translation and commentary, in the context of China and elsewhere.\n",

      "RLST 654 Biblical Interpretation in Early Christianity. Maria Doerfler. Scripture was both the primary focus of early Christians’ literary attentions and the most significant resource for resolving questions of theological, ethical, or practical concern in their communities. Yet Scripture frequently did not speak with sufficient clarity and univocality; it required mediation—in homily, hymn, commentary, and treatise—and, in the process, interpretation and exposition. This course introduces students to a survey of ancient Christian writers’ exegetical efforts from the very beginnings of Christian interpretive activity through the flowering of exegesis across the Roman and Sassanid Empires in the fourth through sixth century.\n",
      "RLST 680 Post-Classical Islamic Thought. Frank Griffel. Whereas the classical period of Islamic theology and philosophy, with prominent movements such as Mu’tazilism, Ash’arism, falsafa, etc., has attracted the bulk of the attention of intellectual historians who work on Islam, research on the period after that has recently caught up and has become one of the most fertile subfields in Islamic studies. This graduate seminar aims to introduce students into the most recent developments in the study of Islam’s post-classical period, which begins in the twelfth century in response to the conflict between Avicenna (d. 1037) and al-Ghazali (d. 1111). In this seminar we read Arabic texts by philosophical, theological, and scientific authors who were active after 1120, among them Abu l-Barakat al-Baghdadi (d. c. 1165), al-Suhrawardi (d. c. 1192), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1210), Athir al-Din al-Abhari (d. 1265), Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (d. 1311), or Shams al-Din al-Samarqandi (d. 1322). The reading of primary literature happens hand in hand with the discussion of secondary works on those texts. Class sessions are usually divided into a discussion of secondary literature and a reading of Arabic sources.\n",

Children’s literature—works written for children, teenagers, and young adults—emerged only in the late nineteenth-century, as childhood itself was newly understood as a special developmental stage in human life. Alphabet primers, picture books, and novels attempted to establish a set of moral and behavioral ethics that structured children’s perceptions of norms and values for many years ahead. In this course, we examine the political life of children’s literature in the Soviet Union. How did Soviet writers initiate their young readers’ perception of the racial, political, gendered Self and Other, particularly as the Soviet Union situated itself as a transcontinental empire? We begin in the 1920s, when the Soviet state revolutionized children’s literature internationally by commissioning books and poems from first-class writers, like Vladimir Mayakovsky, Osip Mandelstam, and Daniil Kharms. As we move through the twentieth century, we investigate how children’s literature responds to the international developments of the Cold War. How is the Soviet ideology of race elaborated in children’s literature? How are children readers invited into the project of empire, and initiated as citizens, in the very act of reading or holding a book? We approach these works as adult interpreters, while also imagining ourselves as children readers. We discuss the multimediality of these texts, the interaction between text and image in illustrated books. Together, we explore the collections of Soviet children’s literature at the Beinecke Library and Princeton’s Cotsen Library. Guest instructors discuss the animal and the human in children’s literature, the relationship between books and toys, and the practice of translating children’s literature.

How indeed are we as readers and players affected by the type of media we consume? What is an adaptation? How do adaptations influence or potentially reshape our relationships with the source material? What themes and ideas are revealed effectively through one medium versus another? Why do certain literary traditions (such as classical Russian literature) provide such fruitful ground for video game adaptation? What are the political implications for the ideologies present in a video game given the globalized position of the medium?

The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course begins by looking at the influence of the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: \"nonconformism,\" \"dissidence,\" \"mimicry,\" \"rebellion.\" The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism.

Its approach is based on an assumption that studying cities is crucial for an understanding of how societies developed on the territory of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and post-Soviet states. The course is structured around the study of ten cities—Kyiv, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Odesa, Baku, Magnitogorsk, Kharkiv, Tashkent, Semey (former Semipalatinsk), and Nur-Sultan (former Astana)—that are located on the territory of modern Ukraine, Russia, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. We study these cities through the prism of various scholarly approaches, as well as historical and visual sources. Literary texts are used not only as a means to illustrate certain historical processes but as artifacts that were instrumental in creating the identity of these cities within and beyond their territories. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquaint all participants with the dynamics of social, cultural, and political development of the ten Eurasian cities, their urban layout and architectural features. The course also provides an overview of basic conceptual approaches to the study of cities and ongoing urbanization in Northern and Central Eurasia.\n",

      "RUSS 325 Ten Eurasian Cities. Nari Shelekpayev. This course explores histories and identities of ten cities in Northern and Central Eurasia. Its approach is based on an assumption that studying cities is crucial for an understanding of how societies developed on the territory of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and post-Soviet states. The course is structured around the study of ten cities—Kyiv, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Odesa, Baku, Magnitogorsk, Kharkiv, Tashkent, Semey (former Semipalatinsk), and Nur-Sultan (former Astana)—that are located on the territory of modern Ukraine, Russia, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. We study these cities through the prism of various scholarly approaches, as well as historical and visual sources. Literary texts are used not only as a means to illustrate certain historical processes but as artifacts that were instrumental in creating the identity of these cities within and beyond their territories. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquaint all participants with the dynamics of social, cultural, and political development of the ten Eurasian cities, their urban layout and architectural features. The course also provides an overview of basic conceptual approaches to the study of cities and ongoing urbanization in Northern and Central Eurasia.\n",

This interdisciplinary seminar is devoted to the study of protest art as part of the struggle of society against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It focuses on the example of the Soviet and post-Soviet transformation of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan, and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course begins by looking at the influence of the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: \"nonconformism,\" \"dissidence,\" \"mimicry,\" \"rebellion.\" The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism.

If not, is this an artifact of our techniques, or a potentially fundamental source of computational hardness? This course surveys a new and growing research area studying such questions on the intersection of high dimensional statistics and theoretical computer science. We discuss various tools to explain the presence of such \"computational-to-statistical gaps\" for several high dimensional inference models. These tools include the \"low-degree polynomials\" method, statistical query lower bounds, and more. We also discuss connections with other fields such as statistical physics and cryptography.\n",
      "S&DS 689 Scientific Machine Learning. Lu Lu. There are two main branches of technical computing: scientific computing and machine learning. Recently, there has been a convergence of the two disciplines in the emerging scientific machine learning (SciML) field. The main objective of this course is to teach theory, algorithms, and implementation of SciML techniques to graduate students. This course entails various methods to solve a broad range of computational problems frequently encountered in solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, nondestructive evaluation of materials, systems biology, chemistry, and non-linear dynamics. The topics in this course cover multi-fidelity learning, physics-informed neural networks, deep neural operators, uncertainty quantification, and parallel computing. Certain materials are discussed through student presentations of selected publications in the area. Students should have prior coursework in advanced calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Having a background in scientific computing, Python, and/or machine learning is helpful but not mandatory.\n",

      "SAST 261 Buddhist Thought: The Foundations. Eric Greene. This class introduces the fundamentals of Buddhist thought, focusing on the foundational doctrinal, philosophical, and ethical ideas that have animated the Buddhist tradition from its earliest days in India 2500 years ago down to the present, in places such as Tibet, China, and Japan. Though there will be occasional discussion of the social and practical contexts of the Buddhist religion, the primary focus of this course lies on how traditional Buddhist thinkers conceptualize the universe, think about the nature of human beings, and propose that people should live their lives. Our main objects of inquiry are therefore the foundational Buddhist ideas, and the classic texts in which those ideas are put forth and defended, that are broadly speaking shared by all traditions of Buddhism. In the later part of the course, we take up some of these issues in the context of specific, regional forms of Buddhism, and watch some films that provide glimpses of Buddhist religious life on the ground.\n",

      "SAST 262 Digital War. From drones and autonomous robots to algorithmic warfare, virtual war gaming, and data mining, digital war has become a key pressing issue of our times and an emerging field of study. This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war.\n",

      "SAST 284 Dialogues on Caste. Rupali Bansode. Ongoing discussions on caste, casteism, and other related themes on either social media platforms or news media have become an everyday phenomenon, but these discussions are often disconnected from the trajectories of academic discourses (for example, intellectual and conceptual histories). As students of sciences, natural or social, it becomes crucial to make and understand the previously made social and historical inquiries around these issues. In this course, we do this by reading and discussing the relevant texts on caste by immersing ourselves collectively for a semester in an exploratory spirit that broadly falls under the rubric of dialogues on caste. However, activist considerations and the concerns of the dalit movements, political parties, affirmative action, and other such dimensions, which, although important, are outside the remit of this course.\n",

      "SBS 535 Social Innovation Starter. Teresa Chahine. Students apply the ten stage framework of the textbook Social Entrepreneurship: Building Impact Step by Step to innovate new solutions for host organizations. Host organizations are social enterprises or other social purpose organizations based globally and locally who present Yale students with a problem statement to work on over the course of one term. This could include creating new programs or products, reaching new populations, measuring the impact of existing work, creating new communications tools for existing work, or other challenges. Students gain social innovation and entrepreneurship experience and host organizations benefit from students’ problem solving. Students from all programs and concentrations at Yale are welcome to join Jackson students in forming interdisciplinary teams to tackle social challenges. This course runs during the same time as Social Entrepreneurship Lab. The key distinction is that in the former, students pick their own topic to research and ideate on; whereas in this course, students work on projects for host organizations. Jackson students may elect to follow up on this course with a summer internship to the host organization, to help support implementation of their solution, if the host organization and the School administration accepts their application.\n",
      "SBS 541 Community Health Program Evaluation. Kathleen Duffany. This course develops students’ skills in designing program evaluations for public health programs, including nongovernmental and governmental agencies in the United States and abroad. Students learn about different types of summative and formative evaluation models and tools for assessment. The course content is based on an ecological framework, principles of public health ethics, a philosophy of problem-based learning, and critiques of evaluation case studies. Students write evaluation plans for a specific existing public health program. Students may also work as a team with a local community health agency reviewing their evaluation plans and providing guidance on developing a program evaluation plan for one of the agency’s public health programs.\n",
      "SBS 565 Trauma and Health. Sarah Lowe. The majority of people will be exposed to one or more traumatic events over the course of their lives. Although exposure to trauma is associated with increased risk for myriad adverse consequences for health and well-being, most survivors are resilient and \"bounce back\" to their pre-trauma levels of functioning. This course engages students in understanding the factors that shape both exposure to traumatic events and the variability in post-trauma outcomes, with a focus on trauma-related mental health conditions. The first half of the course provides foundational information on the assessment and epidemiology of traumatic events; mental and physical health conditions associated with trauma exposure; biological and sociocultural factors that influence trauma exposure and post-trauma outcomes; and public health and clinical approaches to preventing and mitigating trauma. The second half allows for application of this foundational information to specific trauma types (e.g., sexual violence, disasters), based in part on student interest. Assignments require students to critically evaluate state-of-the-science research on trauma and health; identify and explain an intervention or policy geared toward preventing or mitigating trauma; and synthesize empirical literature on a topic of their choice related to trauma and health.\n",
      "SBS 581 Stigma and Health. Katie Wang. This course engages students in conceptualizing stigma as a fundamental cause of adverse health. After reviewing conceptual models of stigma, students examine the multiple mechanisms—both structural and individual—through which stigma compromises the health of a large proportion of U.S. and global populations. Given the relevance of identity and stress to the study of stigma and health, the empirical platform of the course is complemented by considering the relevance of conceptual models of identity, intersectionality, and minority stress. The course reviews social/behavioral and epidemiological methods for studying stigma. Students compare individual- and structural-level interventions to reduce both stigma at its source and its downstream impact on individual health. Class content is organized around themes that cut across all stigmatized conditions and identities. However, students devote course assignments to individual stigmas of their choice. Therefore, students can expect to explain stigma as a predicament that affects nearly all individuals at some point in the life course while developing expertise in one or two stigmas that are particularly relevant to their interests.\n",
      "SBS 585 Sexuality, Gender, Health, and Human Rights. Ali Miller. This course explores the application of human rights perspectives and practices to issues in regard to sexuality, gender, and health. Through reading, interactive discussion, paper presentation, and occasional outside speakers, students learn the tools and implications of applying rights and law to a range of sexuality and health-related topics. The overall goal is twofold: to engage students in the world of global sexual health and rights policy making as a field of social justice and public health action; and to introduce them to conceptual tools that can inform advocacy and policy formation and evaluation. Class participation, a book review, an OpEd, and a final paper required.\n",
      "SBS 588 Health Justice Practicum. Ali Miller, Amy Kapczynski, Daniel Newton, Gregg Gonsalves. This is an experiential learning course focused on domestic and transnational health justice work. Health justice work focuses on health equity and is committed to addressing the fundamental social causes of disease. It also emphases power-building and political economy, instead of viewing health as a technocratic field where issues are resolved through application of expertise alone. Students work on projects supervised by faculty and in collaboration with outside partners. Projects change according to the needs of our partners and are generally determined at the beginning of each term. Credits vary according to the time commitment required by the projects. The course is designed for public health and law students, but other students may enroll where appropriate given project needs.\n",

Special attention is given to matters of style, as well as to advanced morphology and syntax. Additionally, the course pays attention to the scholastic techniques of: (1) word glossing, (2) sentence construction, (3) word morphology through the principle of base and suffix, and (4) compound analysis. With this, the course facilitates learning the art of reading commentaries for the sake of understanding texts.\n",
      "SLAV 243 Race, Identity, and Empire: Soviet Literature for Children and Young Adults, 1920-1970. Children’s literature—works written for children, teenagers, and young adults—emerged only in the late nineteenth-century, as childhood itself was newly understood as a special developmental stage in human life. Alphabet primers, picture books, and novels attempted to establish a set of moral and behavioral ethics that structured children’s perceptions of norms and values for many years ahead. In this course, we examine the political life of children’s literature in the Soviet Union. How did Soviet writers initiate their young readers’ perception of the racial, political, gendered Self and Other, particularly as the Soviet Union situated itself as a transcontinental empire? We begin in the 1920s, when the Soviet state revolutionized children’s literature internationally by commissioning books and poems from first-class writers, like Vladimir Mayakovsky, Osip Mandelstam, and Daniil Kharms. As we move through the twentieth century, we investigate how children’s literature responds to the international developments of the Cold War. How is the Soviet ideology of race elaborated in children’s literature? How are children readers invited into the project of empire, and initiated as citizens, in the very act of reading or holding a book? We approach these works as adult interpreters, while also imagining ourselves as children readers. We discuss the multimediality of these texts, the interaction between text and image in illustrated books. Together, we explore the collections of Soviet children’s literature at the Beinecke Library and Princeton’s Cotsen Library. Guest instructors discuss the animal and the human in children’s literature, the relationship between books and toys, and the practice of translating children’s literature. This course is taught in Russian, with some readings in English and others in Russian.\n",
      "SLAV 313 Art and Resistance in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Andrei Kureichyk. This interdisciplinary seminar is devoted to the study of protest art as part of the struggle of society against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It focuses on the example of the Soviet and post-Soviet transformation of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course begins by looking at the influence of the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: \"nonconformism,\" \"dissidence,\" \"mimicry,\" \"rebellion.\" The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism. These themes are explored at different levels through specific examples from the works and biographies of artists. Students immerse themselves in works of different genres: films, songs, performances, plays and literary works.\n",

      "SOCY 081 Race and Place in British New Wave, K-Pop, and Beyond. Grace Kao. This seminar introduces you to several popular musical genres and explores how they are tied to racial, regional, and national identities. We examine how music is exported via migrants, return migrants, industry professionals, and the nation-state (in the case of Korean Popular Music, or K-Pop). Readings and discussions focus primarily on the British New Wave (from about 1979 to 1985) and K-Pop (1992-present), but we also discuss first-wave reggae, ska, rocksteady from the 1960s-70s, British and American punk rock music (1970s-1980s), the precursors of modern K-Pop, and have a brief discussion of Japanese City Pop. The class focuses mainly on the British New Wave and K-Pop because these two genres of popular music have strong ties to particular geographic areas, but they became or have become extremely popular in other parts of the world. We also investigate the importance of music videos in the development of these genres.\n",
      "SOCY 103 Sports and Society. Alex Manning. Society’s love of sport is matched only by the belief that it is an area not worthy of deeper thought, inquiry, or critique (this especially applies in the United States). This course seeks to understand this seemingly paradoxical notion that sport is both one of most powerful and least respected and unserious institutions in the modern world. To do so we begin by working through theoretical approaches that give us a way to make social sense of these paradoxes and the phenomenon of sport itself. We read, watch, and discuss a wide range of sports and physical practices and interrogate sport from varying analytical levels. We cover modern sport’s historical foundations and deep cultural meaning. Then we focus on sport’s connection to colonialism, nationalism, and broader global and economic systems. We then shift our attention to youth sports culture in the United States and how family life and childhood are intimately connected to sport. In the second half of the course, we center gender and race in order to understand how sport serves as a contested social terrain that both reproduces and challenges systems of patriarchy and racism.\n",

      "SOCY 205 Politics and Culture. This class explores the link between politics and culture, by delving into three subsets of political culture: civil society and power, political performance and communication, and collective action. Throughout the semester, we explore culture as a social force which can shift political life in new directions. Our deep engagement starts with civil society and power, specifically the American understanding of community, to see how civic Republicanism and radical individualism undergird participation in social life. Here, we deconstruct how Americans perceive themselves as political actors and members of a political community, and frame their participation in politics. In political performance and communication, we explore several topics: political speeches, populism as a style, media as a realm of political performance, and collective memory. Learning about the performative side of politics, with real life material, we familiarize ourselves with narratives and deep stories told by people across the political spectrum. In collective action, we look at social media and mobilization, environmental philanthropy, religion in political activism, and emotions. While focusing on case studies students become familiar with different approaches to culture.\n",
      "SOCY 210 The State and its Environment. Benjamin Kaplow, Jonathan Wyrtzen. This course engages two core entwined questions: How does the state impact its surroundings and  environment? And, how do these impact the state? The goal of this course is to give students a grounding in an interdisciplinary range of relevant social science literatures that help them think through those questions and how they relate to each other. The course addresses how states interact with and impact their ecological environment, but centers broader questions of how states relate to space, resources, populations, and to the socially constructed patterns of their physical, cultural, and economic environments. In doing so, the course aims to bridge discussions of state politics with political questions of the environment. In broadening the topic from only ecology, the class aims to help students develop a portable lens with which to examine state formation and its past and present impact in a variety of contexts: economic planning, systems of land management, military rule, taxation, and population control.\n",
      "SOCY 215 Popular Culture and Memory. Yagmur Karakaya. Is consuming the past liberating or mind-numbing? To answer this question, this class examines memory from a sociological perspective while interrogating the intersections between popular culture, populism, and politics of history. As movements like MAGA or Hindutva have shown, the struggle to \"own,\" and \"define,\" the past is a social issue that shapes the contemporary world. These populist uses of the past exist in an environment where entrepreneurs of pop culture, historians, and citizens compete to have a say in what yesterday looked like. For example, the 1619 Project and Get Out both came out during the height of a populist presidency and defined the past in their own terms. Primarily relying on TV and film as data, we think about the current boom in memory content, the fight to control it, and question the outcomes of mass exposure to different pasts.  First, we delve into the origins of collective memory situating the nation-state as the main actor in narrating the past. In doing this we trace the move from triumphalist to apologetic approaches. Second, we learn how globalization and mass media opened up pathways to diversifying state-controlled collective memory. We explore the populist response to this development by looking at Turkey and United States. We end the course by studying the relationship between race and memory in the context of remembering the Civil Rights Movement and the political upheaval surrounding the 1619 project.\n",
      "SOCY 230 Capitalism and Crisis. Isabela Mares. This course provides an introduction to the study of comparative capitalism. We examine how institutions organizing labor markets, finance and the welfare state differ systematically across advanced industrialized countries and the consequence of these differences for a variety of economic and policy outcomes. These include economic growth, unemployment, levels of inequality and so on. Can we meaningfully talk about a German or Swedish model and if so, what are the main institutional arrangements that differ across these economies? How do institutions in these countries differ from more liberal capitalist economies, such as the United States? In the second part of the course, we examine the responses of different countries to a variety of economic shocks. These include the stagflation crisis of the 1970’s, the slowdown in economic growth, deindustrialization, the rise in unemployment and inequality and the migration crisis. We examine how existing political and economic institutions have shaped the policy trade-offs encountered by different countries and we explain the different political responses taken in response to these crises. During the period between November 14 and November 24, enrollment will be limited to majors. After November 24, registration will be opened to all Yale College students.

      "SOCY 266 Tragedies of Social Life and Methods to Address Them. Emily Erikson. When attempting to solve many social problems, good intentions are not enough. It is necessary to understand the interdependencies and secondary consequences of action. This class is premised on the idea that there is often (not necessarily always) an underlying structural aspect to social problems and that understanding the structural aspect can improve our ability to successfully deal with these problems. Everyone sees the forest, but it is harder to see the roots. We are going to try to see the roots of social processes–not in the sense of origins but instead in the way in which they are interconnected. The issues covered by the class are relevant to policy making, law, activism, governance, and management.\n",
      "SOCY 305 Latin American Immigration to the United States: Past, Present, and Future. Angel Escamilla Garcia. Immigration from Latin America is the one of the most important and controversial issues in the United States today. The family separation crisis, the infamous border wall, and the Dream Act dominate political debate. Latinos—numbering more than 60 million in the U.S.—are a large, heterogeneous, and growing group with a unique social, political, and cultural history. This course explores key current issues in immigration, as well as the history of Latin American migration to the U.S., with the aim of providing students the tools necessary to thoughtfully participate in current debates.\n",

Feminism, Islamism, activism, and human rights; fertility, family, marriage, and sexuality.\n",
      "SOCY 331 Sexual Minorities from Plato to the Enlightenment. Igor De Souza. This interdisciplinary course surveys the history of homosexuality from a cross-cultural, comparative  perspective. Students study contexts where homosexuality and sodomy were categorized, regulated, and persecuted and examine ancient and medieval constructions of same-sex desire in light of post-modern developments, challenging ideas around what is considered normal and/or natural. Ultimately, we ask: what has changed, and what has remained the same, in the history of homosexuality? What do gays and lesbians today have in common with pre-modern sodomites? Can this history help us ground or rethink our sexual selves and identities? Primary and secondary historical sources, some legal and religious sources, and texts in intellectual history are studied. Among the case studies for the course are ancient attitudes among Jews, early Christians, and Greeks; Christian theologians of the Middle Ages; Renaissance Florence; the Inquisition in Iberia; colonial Latin America; and the Enlightenment’s condemnation of sodomy by Montesquieu and Voltaire, and its defense by Bentham.\n",

This course explores the challenge black people face when managing their lives in this white space.\n",
      "SOCY 344 Informal Cities. Leigh-Anna Hidalgo. The informal sector is an integral and growing part of major global cities. With a special focus on the context of U.S. cities, students examine where a burgeoning informality is visible in the region’s everyday life. How planners and policymakers address informality is an important social justice challenge. But what is the informal sector, or urban informality, or the informal city? This class addresses such questions through a rigorous examination of the growing body of literature from Sociology, Latinx Studies, Urban Planning, and Geography. We reflect on the debates and theories in the study of informality in the U.S. and beyond and gain an understanding of the prevalence, characteristics, rationale, advantages and disadvantages, and socio-spatial implications of informal cities. More specifically, we examine urban informality in work—examining street vendors, sex workers, and waste pickers—as well as housing, and the built environment.\n",
      "SOCY 351 Race, Medicine, and Technology. Alka Menon. Medicine and technology are important sources of authority and institutionalization in modern societies. Drawing insights from across sociological subfields, the course offers an in-depth investigation of race, medicine, and technology in the 20th and 21st centuries. This course examines the role of medicine and related technologies in defining race and perpetuating racism. We trace how race became an important component of biomedical research in the U.S. We also follow particular medical technologies across borders of time and space, using them to understand race and nationhood in transnational perspective. Taking a broad view of technology, we analyze cutting-edge, state-of-the art technologies alongside older, more mundane technologies and infrastructures. Ultimately, we consider how medical technologies are not just treatments for individual patients but also windows into broader social and cultural structures and processes.\n",
      "SOCY 352 Material Culture and Iconic Consciousness. Jeffrey Alexander. How and why contemporary societies continue to symbolize sacred and profane meanings, investing these meanings with materiality and shaping them aesthetically. Exploration of \"iconic consciousness\" in theoretical terms (philosophy, sociology, semiotics) and further exploration of compelling empirical studies about food and bodies, nature, fashion, celebrities, popular culture, art, architecture, branding, and politics.\n",
      "SOCY 362 Sociogenomics. Ramina Sotoudeh. Since the first human genome was sequenced in 2003, social and behavioral data have become increasingly integrated with genetic data. This has proven important not only for medicine and public health but also for social science. In this course, we cover the foundations of sociogenomics research. We begin by surveying core concepts in the field, from heritability to gene-by-environment interactions, and learning the computational tools necessary for producing sociogenomics research. In later weeks, we read some of the latest applied work in the field and discuss the value and limitations of such research. The course culminates in a final project, in which students are tasked with using empirical data to answer a social genetics question of their own.\n",
      "SOCY 383 Central Americans in the U.S.. Leigh-Anna Hidalgo. This course is an interdisciplinary survey of the social, historical, political, economic, educational, and cultural experiences of Central American immigrants and their children in the United States. The primary objective of the course is to introduce students to several contemporary experiences and issues in the U.S. Central American community. Focusing mostly on Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran immigrants—the three largest groups in the United States—we explore the social structures that constrain individuals as well as the strategies and behaviors immigrants and their communities have taken to establish their presence and make a home in U.S. society and stay connected to their countries of origin. Students gain a critical understanding of Central American identities, particularly as these have been constructed through the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and legal status.\n",
      "SOCY 389 Populism. Paris Aslanidis. Investigation of the populist phenomenon in party systems and the social movement arena. Conceptual, historical, and methodological analyses are supported by comparative assessments of various empirical instances in the US and around the world, from populist politicians such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, to populist social movements such as the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.\n",
      "SOCY 410 Political Protests. Maria Jose Hierro. The 2010s was the \"decade of protest,\" and 2019 capped this decade with an upsurge of protests all over the world. In 2020, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, the US is witnessing the broadest protests in its history. What are the roots of these protests? Under what conditions does protest start? Why do people decide to join a protest? Under what conditions do protests succeed? Can repression kill protest movements? Focusing on recent protest movements across the world, this seminar addresses these, and other questions related to the study of political protest.\n",

A good research design presupposes a well-specified (and hopefully interesting) research question. This question can be stimulated by a theoretical puzzle, an empirical mystery, or a policy problem. With the research question in hand, the next step is to develop a strategy for gathering the empirical evidence that will allow you to answer the question \"as unambiguously as possible.\"\n",

      "SOCY 519 The Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu. Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002) was arguably the greatest sociologist since the classical generation of Max Weber and Emile Durkheim. This seminar provides an intensive and critical introduction to Bourdieu's work and to Bourdieusian research. Through an intensive and extensive reading of Bourdieu's own works, empirical applications of his approach by other scholars, and critical consideration of the approach from other viewpoints, students learn what distinguishes Bourdieu's approach from other classical and contemporary versions of sociology and social science; develop a firm and nuanced grasp of his trademark concepts (\"habitus,\" \"capital,\" and \"field\"); and observe how Bourdieu and others have applied them to the analysis of various social fields (class, gender, the state, politics, art and culture), and how his approach might be deepened.\n",
      "SOCY 534 Cultural Sociology. Yagmur Karakaya. Cultural sociology studies \"irrational\" meanings in supposedly rational, modern societies. Social meanings are symbolic, but also sensual, emotional, and moral. They can deeply divide nations but also powerfully unite them. They affect every dimension of social life, from politics and markets to race and gender relations, class, conflict, and war. We look at how this cultural approach developed, from counterintuitive writings of Durkheim and Weber a century ago, to the breakthroughs of semiotics and anthropology in midcentury, the creation of modern cultural sociology in the 1980s, and new thinking about social performance and material icons today. As we trace this historical arc, we examine ancient and modern religion, contemporary capitalism, the coronation of Elizabeth II, professional wrestling, Americans not eating horses, the Iraq War, the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama's first presidential campaign, and the new cult of vinyl records.\n",
      "SOCY 542 Sociological Theory. Emily Erikson. The course seeks to give students the conceptual tools for a constructive engagement with sociological theory and theorizing.

      "SOCY 625 Analysis of Social Structure. Scott Boorman. Emphasizing analytically integrated viewpoints, the course develops a variety of major contemporary approaches to the study of social structure and social organization. Building in part on research viewpoints articulated by Kenneth J. Arrow in The Limits of Organization (1974), by János Kornai in an address at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences published in 1984, and by Harrison C. White in Identity and Control (2nd ed., 2008), four major species of social organization are identified as focal: (1) social networks, (2) competitive markets, (3) hierarchies/bureaucracy, and (4) collective choice/legislation. This lecture course uses mathematical and computational models—and comparisons of their scientific styles and contributions—as analytical vehicles in coordinated development of the four species.\n",

Meeting weekly throughout both the fall and spring terms, it constitutes an ongoing, informal seminar to explore areas of mutual interest among students and faculty, both visiting and permanent. The core concern of the workshop is social meaning and its forms and processes of institutionalization. Meaning is approached as both structure and performance, drawing not only on the burgeoning area of cultural sociology but on the humanities, philosophy, and other social sciences. Discussions range widely among methodological, theoretical, empirical, and normative issues. Sessions alternate between presentations by students of their own work and by visitors. Contents of the workshop vary from term to term, and from year to year. Enrollment is open to auditors who fully participate and for credit to students who submit written work.\n",

In 1764 Immanuel Kant noted in the margin of one of his published books that evil was \"the subjection of one being under the will of another,\" a sign that good was coming to mean freedom. But what is freedom? Starting with early reference to Kant, we study two major texts on freedom in post-Kantian German Idealism, Schelling's 1809 Philosophical Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom and Related Objects and Hegel's 1820 Elements of the Philosophy of Right.\n",

      "SPAN 228 Borders & Globalization in Hispanophone Cultures. Luna Najera. The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization? \n",

      "SPAN 230 Reading Environments: Nature, Culture, and Agency. Luna Najera. Extreme weather, proliferation of species extinctions, climate migration, and the outbreak of pandemics can all be understood as instances of koyaanisqatsi, the Hopi word for life out of balance. They may also be viewed as indications that we are living in the age of the Anthropocene, a term in the natural and social sciences that acknowledges that human activities have had a radical geological impact on the planet since the onset of the Industrial revolution. In this course we study relations between humans and other-than-humans to understand how we arrived at a life out of balance. We inquire into how binary distinctions between nature and culture are made, sustained, or questioned through a diversity of meaning-making practices in Spanish, Latin American, and indigenous literature, visual culture, and material culture. The indigenous artifacts studied include Popol Vuh, poetry, petroglyphs, and documentaries by indigenous people of the Amazon, which provide opportunities for asking pressing questions: To what extent does the nature and culture binary foreclose alternative possibilities for imagining ourselves and our relation to the world? Are there ways of perceiving our world and ourselves that bypass such binaries and if so, what are they? In the final weeks of the course, we draw from our insights to investigate where the nature/culture binary figures in present discussions of environmental catastrophes and rights of nature movements in Latin America.

This graduate seminar examines the variety of artistic, cultural, historical, and literary representations of black Africans and their descendants—both enslaved and free—across the vast stretches of the Luso-Hispanic world and the United States. Taking a chronological frame, the course begins its study of Blackness in medieval and early modern Iberia and its colonial kingdoms. From there, we examine the status of Blackness conceptually and ideologically in Asia, the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. Toward the end of the semester, we concentrate on black Africans by focusing on Equatorial Guinea, sub-Saharan African immigration in present-day Portugal and Spain, and the politics of Afro-Latinx culture and its identity politics in the United States. Throughout the term, we interrogate the following topics in order to guide our class discussions and readings: bondage and enslavement, fugitivity and maroonage, animal imageries and human-animal studies, geography and maps, Black Feminism and Black Queer Studies, material and visual cultures (e.g., beauty ads, clothing, cosmetics, food, Blackface performance, royal portraiture, reality TV, and music videos), the Inquisition and African diasporic religions, and dispossession and immigration.

      "SPAN 901 Psychoanalysis: Key Conceptual Differences between Freud and Lacan I. Moira Fradinger. This is the first section of a year-long seminar (second section: CPLT 914) designed to introduce the discipline of psychoanalysis through primary sources, mainly from the Freudian and Lacanian corpuses but including late twentieth-century commentators and contemporary interdisciplinary conversations. We rigorously examine key psychoanalytic concepts that students have heard about but never had the chance to study. Students gain proficiency in what has been called \"the language of psychoanalysis,\" as well as tools for critical practice in disciplines such as literary criticism, political theory, film studies, gender studies, theory of ideology, psychology medical humanities, etc. We study concepts such as the unconscious, identification, the drive, repetition, the imaginary, fantasy, the symbolic, the real, and jouissance. A central goal of the seminar is to disambiguate Freud's corpus from Lacan's reinvention of it. We do not come to the \"rescue\" of Freud. We revisit essays that are relevant for contemporary conversations within the international psychoanalytic community. We include only a handful of materials from the Anglophone schools of psychoanalysis developed in England and the US. This section pays special attention to Freud's \"three\" (the ego, superego, and id) in comparison to Lacan's \"three\" (the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real). CPLT 914 devotes, depending on the interests expressed by the group, the last six weeks to special psychoanalytic topics such as sexuation, perversion, psychosis, anti-asylum movements, conversations between psychoanalysis and neurosciences and artificial intelligence, the current pharmacological model of mental health, and/or to specific uses of psychoanalysis in disciplines such as film theory, political philosophy, and the critique of ideology. Apart from Freud and Lacan, we will read work by Georges Canguilhem, Roman Jakobson, Victor Tausk, Émile Benveniste, Valentin Volosinov, Guy Le Gaufey, Jean Laplanche, Étienne Balibar, Roberto Esposito, Wilfred Bion, Félix Guattari, Markos Zafiropoulos, Franco Bifo Berardi, Barbara Cassin, Renata Salecl, Maurice Godelier, Alenka Zupančič, Juliet Mitchell, Jacqueline Rose, Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing, Eric Kandel, and Lera Boroditsky among others. No previous knowledge of psychoanalysis is needed. Starting out from basic questions, we study how psychoanalysis, arguably, changed the way we think of human subjectivity. Graduate students from all departments and schools on campus are welcome.

They existed in circumstances of physical and sexual violence, of civil war, of racial discrimination, of isolation; they also lived in circumstances that cannot be properly expressed outside their own experiments with literature. Our guests write from many directions, for many audiences, for many souls: novels, reviews, the lives of afrodescendent people, dance, race, sexual violences, asylum briefs, and so many other forms of polyhedric writing that explore the limits of literature—and those of survival. They are in conversation about their work, about their thought, and, certainly, about the joys and frustrations of the literary worlds they inhabit. The thirteen nights in the series will be held from September through November.

This two-semester sequence, of which this class is the first half, is designed to assist students who already have the equivalent of at least two-years of Classical Tibetan language study. The course is intended to build on this foundation so that students gain greater proficiency in reading a variety of classical Tibetan writing styles and genres, including texts relevant to their research. The course readings focus primarily on texts written during the Ganden Phodrang period up through the 19th century. Over two semesters, the class covers three sets of  materials: 1) famous or otherwise influential classical works (mostly historical, some literary); 2) important historical texts that have come to light in recent years but are scarcely known in western scholarship; and 3) classical language texts that support the research needs of enrolled students. Classical Tibetan grammar and other conventions are identified and discussed in the course of the readings.\n",
      "THST 051 Performing Antiquity. This seminar introduces students to some of the most influential texts of Greco-Roman Antiquity and investigates the meaning of their \"performance\" in different ways: 1) how they were musically and dramatically performed in their original context in Antiquity (what were the rhythms, the harmonies, the dance-steps, the props used, etc.); 2) what the performance meant, in socio-cultural and political terms, for the people involved in performing or watching it, and how performance takes place beyond the stage; 3) how these texts are performed in modern times (what it means for us to translate and stage ancient plays with masks, a chorus, etc.; to reenact some ancient institutions; to reconstruct ancient instruments or compose \"new ancient music\"); 4) in what ways modern poems, plays, songs, ballets constitute forms of interpretation, appropriation, or contestation of ancient texts; 5) in what ways creative and embodied practice can be a form of scholarship. Besides reading ancient Greek and Latin texts in translation, students read and watch performances of modern works of reception: poems, drama, ballet, and instrumental music. A few sessions are devoted to practical activities (reenactment of a symposium, composition of ancient music, etc.).\n",

      "THST 218 Remapping Dance. Amanda Reid, Ameera Nimjee, Rosa van Hensbergen. What does it mean to be at home in a body? What does it mean to move freely, and what kinds of bodies are granted that right? How is dance encoded as bodies move between various sites? In this team-taught class, we remap the field of dance through its migratory routes to understand how movement is shaped by the connections and frictions of ever-changing communities. As three dance scholars, bringing specialisms in West Indian dance, South Asian dance, and East Asian dance, we are looking to decenter the ways in which dance is taught, both in what we teach and in the ways we teach. Many of the dancers we follow create art inspired by migration, exile, and displacement (both within and beyond the nation) to write new histories of political belonging. Others trace migratory routes through mediums, ideologies, and technologies. The course is structured around four units designed to invite the remapping of dance through its many spaces of creativity: The Archive, The Studio, The Field, and The Stage. Throughout, we explore how different ideas of virtuosity, risk, precarity, radicalism, community, and solidarity are shaped by space and place. We rethink how local dance economies are governed by world markets and neoliberal funding models and ask how individual bodies can intervene in these global systems.\n",
      "THST 220 Introduction to Directing. Dexter Singleton.

      "THST 227 Queer Caribbean Performance. Amanda Reid. With its lush and fantastic landscape, fabulous carnivalesque aesthetics, and rich African Diaspora Religious traditions, the Caribbean has long been a setting where New World black artists have staged competing visions of racial and sexual utopia and dystopia. However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the \"tropics\" has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class begins with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique’s roots in black feminisms. We cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.\n",

      "THST 314 Art and Resistance in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Andrei Kureichyk. This interdisciplinary seminar is devoted to the study of protest art as part of the struggle of society against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It focuses on the example of the Soviet and post-Soviet transformation of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The period under discussion begins after the death of Stalin in 1953 and ends with the art of protest against the modern post-Soviet dictatorships of Alexander Lukashenka in Belarus and Vladimir Putin in Russia, the protest art of the Ukrainian Maidan and the anti-war movement of artists against the Russian-Ukrainian war. The course begins by looking at the influence of the \"Khrushchev Thaw\" on literature and cinema, which opened the way for protest art to a wide Soviet audience. We explore different approaches to protest art in conditions of political unfreedom: \"nonconformism,\" \"dissidence,\" \"mimicry,\" \"rebellion.\" The course investigates the existential conflict of artistic freedom and the political machine of authoritarianism. These themes are explored at different levels through specific examples from the works and biographies of artists. Students immerse themselves in works of different genres: films, songs, performances, plays and literary works.\n",

      "THST 334 Advanced Study for Acting and Directing for Solo Performance. Deborah Margolin. For the actor, the call to perform alone onstage happens in many different dramaturgical contexts. Solo performance is at once an old and new art form: Homer sang the Odyssey by himself; Hamlet stands alone onstage questioning his own ontology and the nature of being in general. Priests, stand-up comedians, monologuists, TED-talkers: all solo artists. These instances demand of the actor the very specific and unusual kind of presentness that characterizes solo performance. And for the director of solo performance, the challenges are also very particular: how to establish the actor’s relationship to the audience, and how to direct the audience to the actor, be it as scene partner, as confidante, as eavesdropper, as a body of concerned witnesses. This course examines all dramatic modes of aloneness onstage, all the way through from the thinking-aloud of the soliloquy, the in-medias-res monologue, the stand-up comedy routine. Text analysis is followed by the study of acting techniques in best accordance with any given text. Students have the opportunity to perform classic monologues, as well as to explore modern performance texts and comedic performance. Students are also required to take on responsibilities for directing others in focusing and shaping solo work, and therefore thinking about the way aloneness on stage signifies, in ways that are both similar and very different to traditional, multicharacter scene work.\n",

      "THST 350 Drama in Diaspora: South Asian American Theater and Performance. Shilarna Stokes. South Asian Americans have appeared on U.S. stages since the late nineteenth century, yet only in the last quarter century have plays and performances by South Asian Americans begun to dismantle dominant cultural representations of South Asian and South Asian American communities and to imagine new ways of belonging. This seminar introduces you to contemporary works of performance (plays, stand-up sets, multimedia events) written and created by U.S.-based artists of South Asian descent as well as artists of the South Asian diaspora whose works have had an impact on U.S. audiences. With awareness that the South Asian American diaspora comprises multiple, contested, and contingent identities, we investigate how artists have worked to manifest complex representations of South Asian Americans onstage, challenge institutional and professional norms, and navigate the perils and pleasures of becoming visible. No prior experience with or study of theater/performance required. Students in all years and majors welcome.\n",
      "THST 382 American Opera Today: Explorations of a Burgeoning Industry. Allison Chu, Gundula Kreuzer. Contemporary opera constitutes one of the most vibrant sectors of classical music in the United States today. The past decade has seen a range of experimental performances that excitingly challenge stylistic and generic boundaries, and a widening spectrum of creators have been reaching to opera as a medium to center and (re)present stories of historically marginalized communities. Beyond introducing students to the richness of this new repertory, the seminar addresses the broad socio-political and economic currents underlying these recent changes in American opera, including institutional and funding structures; the role of PR, criticism, awards, and other taste-making agents; and cultural reckonings with systemic racism, engrained injustices, and white supremacy. A selection of recent operas or scenes—available as video recordings or audio files—allows us to explore aesthetic issues, such as narrative structures, diverse treatments of the (singing) voice, embodiment, interactivity, immersion, the role of digital media, mobility, site-specificity, and new online formats for opera. Students learn how to write about contemporary performances and works for which little scholarship is yet available; practice both public-facing and academic writing; recognize and critique contemporary canon-formation processes; and relate contemporary artistic practices to a larger institutional and economic ecosystem. At least one trip to the Metropolitan Opera is anticipated, for Anthony Davis and Thulani Davis’ X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X.\n",

      "THST 430 Performing Publics. Shilarna Stokes. This course explores genres of political performance in which collective bodies, spaces, ideas, and stories come together, and in which the question of what it might mean to identify as a collective body (public, community, nation, coalition) is at stake. Examples include performance genres with long histories such as festivals, protests, and rallies, as well as emerging genres such as school board meetings, knitting circles, and superfan gatherings. Reading across a range of fields including theater, dance, visual arts, and performance studies, we dwell on the question of how collective performances attempt to construct, contest, or transform collective imaginaries, we develop a shared set of analytical tools, and we put our heads together during research workshops designed to support each student's original research project. No prior experience in performance or performance theory is needed and students in all majors are welcome.\n",
      "THST 438 Theater and Therapy in the Aftermath of War. Elise Morrison. From the burgeoning field of Drama Therapy to the psychological basis of much actor training to the prevalence of theater productions being made with, for, and about people that have experienced wartime trauma, the practices of theater and therapy have long borrowed terminology, methodology, and conceptual frameworks from one another. This course traces the shared rhetoric and dramaturgical similarities between theater and psychotherapy, paying particular attention to how each/both are being applied to the global epidemic of post-traumatic stress in the aftermath of war. Students engage with contemporary practitioners of drama therapy, study recent theater productions created with and/or for combat veterans and refugees, and create their own research projects that explore the intersections of theater and therapy.\n",

      "THST 471 Directed Independent Study. Hal Brooks. An independent study should generally conform to the standards and procedures of the senior project, THST 491, even when not undertaken by a senior. If the independent study is a performance or directing project, the adviser visits rehearsals and performances at the mutual convenience of adviser and student. The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before—not after—the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period.\n",
      "An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages.

We study these cities through the prism of various scholarly approaches, as well as historical and visual sources. Literary texts are used not only as a means to illustrate certain historical processes but as artifacts that were instrumental in creating the identity of these cities within and beyond their territories. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquaint all participants with the dynamics of social, cultural, and political development of the ten Eurasian cities, their urban layout and architectural features. The course also provides an overview of basic conceptual approaches to the study of cities and ongoing urbanization in Northern and Central Eurasia.\n",
      "URBN 314 History of Landscape in Western Europe and the United States: Antiquity to 1950. Warren Fuermann. This course is designed as an introductory survey of the history of landscape architecture and the wider, cultivated landscape in Western Europe and the United States from the Ancient Roman period to mid-twentieth century America. Included in the lectures, presented chronologically, are the gardens of Ancient Rome, medieval Europe, the early and late Italian Renaissance, 17th century France, 18th century Britain, 19th century Britain and America with its public and national parks, and mid-twentieth century America. The course focuses each week on one of these periods, analyzes in detail iconic gardens of the period, and placse them within their historical and theoretical context.\n",
      "URBN 318 Informal Cities. Leigh-Anna Hidalgo. The informal sector is an integral and growing part of major global cities. With a special focus on the context of U.S. cities, students examine where a burgeoning informality is visible in the region’s everyday life. How planners and policymakers address informality is an important social justice challenge. But what is the informal sector, or urban informality, or the informal city? This class addresses such questions through a rigorous examination of the growing body of literature from Sociology, Latinx Studies, Urban Planning, and Geography. We reflect on the debates and theories in the study of informality in the U.S. and beyond and gain an understanding of the prevalence, characteristics, rationale, advantages and disadvantages, and socio-spatial implications of informal cities. More specifically, we examine urban informality in work—examining street vendors, sex workers, and waste pickers—as well as housing, and the built environment.\n",
      "URBN 327 Difference and the City. Justin Moore. Four hundred and odd years after colonialism and racial capitalism brought twenty and odd people from Africa to the dispossessed indigenous land that would become the United States, the structures and systems that generate inequality and white supremacy persist. Our cities and their socioeconomic and built environments continue to exemplify difference. From housing and health to mobility and monuments, cities small and large, north and south, continue to demonstrate intractable disparities. The disparate impacts made apparent by the COVID-19 pandemic and the reinvigorated and global Black Lives Matter movement demanding change are remarkable. Change, of course, is another essential indicator of difference in urban environments, exemplified by the phenomena of disinvestment or gentrification. This course explores how issues like climate change and growing income inequality intersect with politics, culture, gender equality, immigration and migration, technology, and other considerations and forms of disruption.\n",
      "URBN 345 Civic Art: Introduction to Urban Design. Alan Plattus. Introduction to the history, analysis, and design of the urban landscape.

      "URBN 417 Marronage Practice: Architectures, Design Methods, and Urbanisms of Freedom. Ana Duran. This seminar introduces and explores Black, indigenous, and other historically marginalized modes of cultural production—collectively referred to here as \"fugitive practices.\" The course confronts the erasure (and re-centering) of these modes by rethinking the episteme of architecture—questioning history, planning, and urbanism—but also of the body, the design of objects, and making. Modes of sociocultural and aesthetic production explored in the course may include: improvisation in jazz, hip-hop and social dance; textiles of the Modern African Diaspora and indigenous peoples; informal economies; ingenuity in vernacular architecture; and others. The course is structured around seven two-week \"modules,\" each containing a seminar discussion, a design exercise, and a short written accompaniment. It is conducted in collaboration with a parallel seminar being offered by faculty at Howard University.\n",
      "URBN 442 Infrastructures of Empire: Control and (In)security in the Global South. Leslie Gross-Wyrtzen. This advanced seminar examines the role that infrastructure plays in producing uneven geographies of power historically and in the \"colonial present\" (Gregory 2006). After defining terms and exploring the ways that infrastructure has been conceptualized and studied, we analyze how different types of infrastructure (energy, roads, people, and so on) constitute the material and social world of empire. At the same time, infrastructure is not an uncontested arena: it often serves as a key site of political struggle or even enters the fray as an unruly actor itself, thus conditioning possibilities for anti-imperial and decolonial practice. The geographic focus of this course is the African continent, but we explore comparative cases in other regions of the majority and minority world.\n",

      "WGSS 036 Gender, Sexuality, and U.S. Empire. Talya Zemach-Bersin. This course explores the cultural history of America’s relationship to the world across the long twentieth century with particular attention to the significance of gender, sexuality, and race. We locate U.S. culture and politics within an international dynamic, exposing the interrelatedness of domestic and foreign affairs. While exploring specific geopolitical events like the Spanish-American War, World War I and II, and the Cold War, this course emphasizes the political importance of culture and ideology rather than offering a formal overview of U.S. foreign policy. How have Americans across the twentieth century drawn from ideas about gender to understand their country’s relationship to the wider world? In what ways have gendered ideologies and gendered approaches to politics shaped America’s performance on the world’s stage? How have geopolitical events impacted the construction of race and gender on the home front? In the most general sense, this course is designed to encourage students to understand American cultural and gender history as the product of America’s engagement with the world. In so doing, we explore the rise of U.S. global power as an enterprise deeply related to conceptions of race, sexuality, and gender. We also examine films, political speeches, visual culture, music, and popular culture.\n",

An aspiration of this course, as political as it is pedagogic, is that students approach their world-building projects with an enriched understanding of the ways gender, justice, and power shape and are shaped by institutions, inequality, and theory. Part I opens up some preliminary considerations of our course terms by investigating the case of abortion, abortion rights, and reproductive justice.  The topic is politically loaded, philosophically complex, and emotionally challenging; the point is not to convince you of the permissibility or impermissibility of abortion, but to explore how the contested case configures, imbricates, and puts pressure on our course terms. In Part II, we examine the historical and conceptual coordinates of the courses first three titular terms: is gender a subjective identification, social ascription, or axis of inequality? Is justice a matter of redistribution, recognition, resources, capabilities, or something more hedonic? Where is power located, or where does it circulate? Who are what leverages power? In Part III, we consider ways gender, justice, and power travel within and across several institutions: heterosexuality, the university, the trafficking/anti-trafficking industrial complex, the prison, and the bathroom. Part IV closes out the course by focusing on the reconfiguration of democratic institutions in late modernity; or, can institutions \"love us back\" under the the political economy we shorthand as \"neoliberalism\"?\n",

An aspiration of this course, as political as it is pedagogic, is that students approach their world-building projects with an enriched understanding of the ways gender, justice, and power shape and are shaped by institutions, inequality, and theory. Part I opens up some preliminary considerations of our course terms by investigating the case of abortion, abortion rights, and reproductive justice.  The topic is politically loaded, philosophically complex, and emotionally challenging; the point is not to convince you of the permissibility or impermissibility of abortion, but to explore how the contested case configures, imbricates, and puts pressure on our course terms. In Part II, we examine the historical and conceptual coordinates of the courses first three titular terms: is gender a subjective identification, social ascription, or axis of inequality? Is justice a matter of redistribution, recognition, resources, capabilities, or something more hedonic? Where is power located, or where does it circulate? Who are what leverages power? In Part III, we consider ways gender, justice, and power travel within and across several institutions: heterosexuality, the university, the trafficking/anti-trafficking industrial complex, the prison, and the bathroom. Part IV closes out the course by focusing on the reconfiguration of democratic institutions in late modernity; or, can institutions \"love us back\" under the the political economy we shorthand as \"neoliberalism\"?\n",
      "WGSS 209 Dionysus in Modernity. George Syrimis. Modernity's fascination with the myth of Dionysus.

      "WGSS 232 Porvida: Latinx Queer Trans Life. Deb Vargas. This course provides an introduction to Latinx queer trans* studies. We approach the field of Latinx queer trans* studies as an ongoing political project that emerges from social justice activism, gay/lesbian/queer/trans studies, critical race feminism, cultural practitioners, among other work.

      "WGSS 233 Weird Greek Wave Cinema. George Syrimis. The course examines the cinematic production of Greece in the last fifteen years or so and looks critically at the popular term \"weird Greek wave\" applied to it. Noted for their absurd tropes, bizarre narratives, and quirky characters, the films question and disturb traditional gender and social roles, as well as international viewers’ expectations of national stereotypes of classical luminosity―the proverbial \"Greek light\"―Dionysian exuberance, or touristic leisure. Instead, these works frustrate not only a wholistic reading of Greece as a unified and coherent social construct, but also the physical or aesthetic pleasure of its landscape and its ‘quaint’ people with their insistence on grotesque, violent, or otherwise disturbing images or themes (incest, sexual otherness and violence, aggression, corporeality, and xenophobia). The course also pays particular attention on the economic and political climate of the Greek financial crisis during which these films are produced and consumed and to which they partake.\n",
      "WGSS 238 Foucault and the Sexual Self. Igor De Souza. This course explores the main ideas and influence of Foucault's History of Sexuality.

      "WGSS 251 Experiments in the Novel: The Eighteenth Century. Jill Campbell. The course provides an introduction to English-language novels of the long eighteenth century (1688-1818), the period in which the novel has traditionally been understood to have \"risen.\" Emphasizing the experimental nature of novel-writing in this early period of its history, the course foregrounds persistent questions about the genre as well as a literary-historical survey: What is the status of fictional characters? How does narrative sequence impart political or moral implications? How do conventions of the novel form shape our experience of gender? What kind of being is a narrator? Likely authors include Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Laurence Sterne, Maria Edgeworth, Jane Austen, Jennifer Egan, Colson Whitehead, and Richard Powers.\n",

      "WGSS 291 Sexual Minorities from Plato to the Enlightenment. Igor De Souza. This interdisciplinary course surveys the history of homosexuality from a cross-cultural, comparative  perspective. Students study contexts where homosexuality and sodomy were categorized, regulated, and persecuted and examine ancient and medieval constructions of same-sex desire in light of post-modern developments, challenging ideas around what is considered normal and/or natural. Ultimately, we ask: what has changed, and what has remained the same, in the history of homosexuality? What do gays and lesbians today have in common with pre-modern sodomites? Can this history help us ground or rethink our sexual selves and identities? Primary and secondary historical sources, some legal and religious sources, and texts in intellectual history are studied. Among the case studies for the course are ancient attitudes among Jews, early Christians, and Greeks; Christian theologians of the Middle Ages; Renaissance Florence; the Inquisition in Iberia; colonial Latin America; and the Enlightenment’s condemnation of sodomy by Montesquieu and Voltaire, and its defense by Bentham.\n",

      "WGSS 305 Black Feminist Theory. Gail Lewis. This course is designed to introduce you to some of the major themes in black feminist theory. The course does so by presenting classic texts with more recent ones to give you a sense of the vibrancy of black feminist theory for addressing past and present concerns. Rather than interpret black feminist theory as a critical formation that simply puts race, gender, sexuality, and class into conversation with one another, the course apprehends that formation as one that produced epistemic shifts in how we understand politics, empire, history, the law, and literature. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the areas into which black feminism intervened. It is merely a sample of some of the most vibrant ideological and discursive contexts in which black feminism caused certain epistemic transformations.\n",
      "WGSS 313 Feminist Science and Technology Studies. Natali Valdez. This seminar examines the production of scientific knowledge with an attention to race, gender, and power. It is guided by these key questions: who gets to produce knowledge? What counts as scientific knowledge? What kinds of power structures shape the production of science? How can Black, Indigenous, and postcolonial feminist approaches improve the production, application, and interpretation of science and technology? In the exploration of these questions, students are introduced to the interdisciplinary field of Feminist Science and Technology Studies (FSTS). The course is organized into three parts. Part I explores the history and theories of feminist science studies. From a history of science perspective students explore how modern science was and still is used to classify human difference across race and gender. Part II focuses on feminist examinations of biology, physics, and data science. Through the lens of feminist materialism, we explore topics including environmental politics, reproductive politics, and the relationship between science and capitalism. The final part of the course explores feminist science fiction and queer science writing to examine how science shapes social worlds and in turn how feminist and queer authors reimagine categories of race and gender through science.\n",
      "WGSS 315 Psychology of Gender. Tariq Khan. This course explores the historical relationship between the \"mind sciences\" and dominant gender notions, ideologies, and norms. Students will critically examine the historical role that psychology and related fields have played in reinforcing and perpetuating things such as gender hierarchy, the gender binary, and the cis-hetero-patriarchal nuclear family unit, among other things. Students will be introduced to works that illuminate the larger underlying social, political, and economic systems, institutions, and historical processes that are co-constitutive with these gender hierarchies, ideologies, and norms, with an emphasis on the role of psychology and related fields. Students will also learn about psychologists and related scientists and scholars whose work has challenged those systems and institutions toward a more emancipatory vision for the role of psychology in society, and how their work has shaped the field.\n",

      "WGSS 335 LGBTQ Life Spans. Scott Herring. Interdisciplinary survey of LGBTQ life spans in the United States concentrating primarily on later life. Special attention paid to topics such as disability, aging, and ageism; queer and trans creative aging; longevity and life expectancy during the AIDS epidemic; intergenerational intimacy; age and activism; critiques of optimal aging; and the development of LGBTQ senior centers and affordable senior housing. We explore these topics across multiple contemporary genres: documentary film (The Joneses), graphic memoir (Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home), poetry (Essex Hemphill’s \"Vital Signs\"), fabulation (Saidiya Hartman’s Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments), and oral history. We also review archival documents of later LGBTQ lives—ordinary and iconic—held at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library as well as the Lesbian Herstory Archives.\n",

      "WGSS 362 Dangerous Women: Sirens, Sibyls, Poets and Singers from Sappho through Elena Ferrante. Jane Tylus. Was Sappho a feminist? This course tries to answer that question by analyzing how women’s voices have been appropriated by the literary and cultural canon of the west–and how in turn women writers and readers have reappropriated those voices. Students read a generous amount of literary (and in some cases, musical) works, along with a variety of contemporary theoretical approaches so as to engage in conversation about authorship, classical reception, and materiality. Following an introduction to Greek and Roman texts key for problematic female figures such as sirens and sibyls, we turn to two later historical moments to explore how women artists have both broken out of and used the western canon, redefining genre, content, and style in literary creation writ large. How did Renaissance women such as Laura Cereta, Gaspara Stampa, and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz fashion themselves as authors in light of the classical sources they had at hand? And once we arrive in the 20th and 21st centuries, how do Sibilla Aleramo, Elsa Morante, Anna Maria Ortese, and Elena Ferrante forge a new, feminist writing via classical, queer and/or animal viewpoints?\n",
      "WGSS 381 New Developments in Global African Diaspora Studies. Fatima El-Tayeb. This course traces recent developments in African Diaspora Theory, among them Afropessimism, Queer of Color Critique, Black Trans Studies and Afropolitanism. We pay particular attention to interactions between theory, art, and activism. The scope is transnational with a focus on, but not restricted to, the Anglophone DiasporaTexts. Each session roughly follows this structure: One theoretical text representing a recent development in African diaspora studies, one earlier key text that the reading builds on, one theoretical text that does not necessarily fall under the category of diaspora studies but speaks to our topic and one text that relates to the topic but uses a non-theoretical format. Students are expected to develop their own thematically related project over the course of the semester.\n",

      "WGSS 438 Subjectivity and its Discontents: Psychosocial Explorations in Black, Feminist, Queer. Gail Lewis. Questions of subjectivity stand at the base of much feminist, black, queer scholarship yet how subjectivity is constituted, whether it is fixed or fluid, how it links to narratives of experience, and how it can be apprehended in critical inquiry is often left implicit. Beginning with a brief consideration of psychoanalytic conceptions of ‘the subject’, ‘subjectivity’ and their relation to social formations, this course examines some of the ways in which subjectivity has been theorized and brought under critical scrutiny by black diasporic, feminist and queer scholars. It draws on work produced in reference to multiple sites, including the UK, the USA and the Caribbean within the fields of psychoanalysis, social science, the humanities and critical art practice. It aims to critique the divide between ‘interior’ psychic life and ‘exterior’ social selves, as well as considering the relation between ‘freedom’ and subjectivity, including the extent to which ‘freedom’ might require rejection of ‘subjectivity’ as a mode of personhood.\n",

      "WGSS 661 Queer Theology. Linn Tonstad. In the United States, queer theory emerged out of the Reagan years, the devastation of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the combined impacts of neoliberalism and gentrification (politically, geographically, and socially) on queer communities. In spring 2022, we encounter each other in the midst of two pandemics: COVID-19 and the one that is not over. This course thinks and reads queer theology with attention to the many challenges highlighted by the two pandemics, HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, focusing on how flesh is thought and represented. Readings take up questions of ethics and moralization; stigma and fear of the other; togetherness and the risk of difference; pleasure, wisdom, foolishness, and loss; negativity, sodomy, and divine violence; race (especially anti-blackness) and gender; and the genres of queer theological writings.\n",
      "WGSS 677 Feminist Philosophy: Theories of Sex, Gender, and Sexual Orientation. Robin Dembroff. This course surveys several feminist frameworks for thinking about sex, gender, and sexual orientation. We consider questions such as: Is there a tenable distinction between sex and gender? Between gender and sexual orientation? What does it mean to say that gender is a social construction, or that sexual orientation is innate? What is the place of politics in gender and sexual identities? How do these identities—and especially resistant or transgressive identities—impact the creation and revision of social categories?\n",
      "WGSS 696 Michel Foucault I: The Works, The Interlocutors, The Critics. This graduate-level course presents students with the opportunity to develop a thorough, extensive, and deep (though still not exhaustive!) understanding of the oeuvre of Michel Foucault, and his impact on late-twentieth-century criticism and intellectual history in the United States. Non-francophone and/or U.S. American scholars, as Lynne Huffer has argued, have engaged Foucault’s work unevenly and frequently in a piecemeal way, due to a combination of the overemphasis on The History of Sexuality, Vol 1 (to the exclusion of most of his other major works), and the lack of availability of English translations of most of his writings until the early twenty-first century. This course seeks to correct that trend and to re-introduce Foucault’s works to a generation of graduate students who, on the whole, do not have extensive experience with his oeuvre. In this course, we read almost all of Foucault’s published writings that have been translated into English (which is almost all of them, at this point). We read all of the monographs, and all of the Collège de France lectures, in chronological order. This lightens the reading load; we read a book per week, but the lectures are shorter and generally less dense than the monographs. [The benefit of a single author course is that the more time one spends reading Foucault’s work, the easier reading his work becomes.] We read as many of the essays he published in popular and more widely-circulated media as we can. The goal of the course is to give students both breadth and depth in their understanding of Foucault and his works, and to be able to situate his thinking in relation to the intellectual, social, and political histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Alongside Foucault himself, we read Foucault’s mentors, interlocutors, and inheritors (Heidegger, Marx, Blanchot, Canguilhem, Derrida, Barthes, Althusser, Bersani, Hartman, Angela Davis, etc); his critics (Mbembe, Weheliye, Butler, Said, etc.), and scholarship that situates his thought alongside contemporary social movements, including student, Black liberation, prison abolitionist, and anti-psychiatry movements.\n",

Through history, fiction, autobiography, art, religion, film, music, and cultural criticism we discuss and explore the construction of African American women’s activism and feminism; the racial politics of the body, beauty, and complexion; hetero- and same-sex sexualities; intraracial class relations; and the politics of identity, family, and work.\n",
